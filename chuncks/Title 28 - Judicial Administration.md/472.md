#### Subpart C - District of Columbia Code: Prisoners and Parolees
##### § 2.77 Medical parole.

(a) Upon receipt of a report from the institution in which the prisoner is confined that the prisoner is terminally ill, or is permanently and irreversibly incapacitated by a physical or medical condition that is not terminal, the Commission shall determine whether or not to release the prisoner on medical parole. Release on medical parole may be ordered by the Commission at any time, whether or not the prisoner has completed his or her minimum sentence. Consideration for medical parole shall be in addition to any other parole for which a prisoner may be eligible.

(b) A prisoner may be granted a medical parole on the basis of terminal illness if:

(1) The institution's medical staff has provided the Commission with a reasonable medical judgment that the prisoner is within six months of death due to an incurable illness or disease; and

(2) The Commission finds that:

(i) The prisoner will not be a danger to himself or others; and

(ii) Release on parole will not be incompatible with the welfare of society.

(c) A prisoner may be granted a medical parole on the basis of permanent and irreversible incapacitation only if the Commission finds that:

(1) The prisoner will not be a danger to himself or others because his condition renders him incapable of continued criminal activity; and

(2) Release on parole will not be incompatible with the welfare of society.

(d) The seriousness of the prisoner's crime shall be considered in determining whether or not a medical parole should be granted prior to completion of the prisoner's minimum sentence.

(e) A prisoner, or the prisoner's representative, may apply for a medical parole by submitting an application to the institution case management staff, who shall forward the application, accompanied by a medical report and any recommendations, within 15 days. The Commission shall render a decision within 15 days of receiving the application and report.

(f) A prisoner, the prisoner's representative, or the institution may request the Commission to reconsider its decision on the basis of changed circumstances.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a prisoner shall not be eligible for medical parole on the basis of a physical or medical condition that existed at the time the prisoner was sentenced (D.C. Code 24-462).
