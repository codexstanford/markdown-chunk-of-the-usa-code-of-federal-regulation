##### § 65.84 Procedures for the Attorney General when seeking State or local assistance.

(a)(1) When the Attorney General determines to seek assistance from a State or local government under § 65.83 of this subpart, or when the President has determined that an immigration emergency exists, the Attorney General shall negotiate the terms and conditions of that assistance with the State or local government. The Attorney General shall then execute a written agreement with appropriate State or local officials, which sets forth the terms and conditions of the assistance, including funding. Such written agreements can be reimbursement agreements, grants, or cooperative agreements.

(2) The Commissioner may execute written contingency agreements regarding assistance under § 65.83(d) of this subpart in advance of the Attorney General's determination pursuant to that section. However, such advance agreements shall not authorize State or local law enforcement officers to perform any functions of Service officers or employees under section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), until the Attorney General has made the necessary determinations and authorizes such performance. Any such advance agreements shall contain precise activation procedures.

(3) Written agreements regarding assistance under § 65.83(d) of this subpart, including contingency agreements, shall include the following minimum requirements:

(i) A statement of the powers, privileges, or duties that State or local law enforcement officers will be authorized to exercise and the conditions under which they may be exercised;

(ii) A statement of the types of assistance by State or local law enforcement officers for which the Attorney General shall be responsible for reimbursing the relevant parties in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section;

(iii) A statement that the relevant State or local law enforcement officers are not authorized to exercise any functions of Service officers or employees under section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), until the Attorney General has made a determination pursuant to that section and authorizes such performance;

(iv) A requirement that State or local law enforcement officers cannot exercise any authorized functions of Service officers or employees under section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), until they have successfully completed and been certified in a Service-prescribed course of instruction in basic immigration law, immigration law enforcement fundamentals and procedures, civil rights law, and sensitivity and cultural awareness issues;

(v) A description of the duration of the written agreement, and of the authority the Attorney General will confer upon State or local law enforcement officers pursuant to section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), along with a provision for amending, terminating, or extending the duration of the written agreement, or for terminating or amending the authority to be conferred pursuant to section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8);

(vi) A requirement that the exercise of any Service officer functions by State or local law enforcement officers pursuant to section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), be at the direction of the Service;

(vii) A requirement that any State or local law enforcement officer performing Service officer or employee functions pursuant to section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), must adhere to the policies and standards set forth during the training, including applicable immigration law enforcement standards and procedures, civil rights law, and sensitivity and cultural awareness issues;

(viii) A statement that the authority to perform Service officer or employee functions pursuant to section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), does not abrogate or abridge constitutional or civil rights protections;

(ix) A requirement that a complaint reporting and resolution procedure for allegations of misconduct or wrongdoing by State or local officers designated, or activities undertaken, pursuant to section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), be in place;

(x) A requirement that a mechanism to record and monitor complaints regarding the immigration enforcement activities of State or local law enforcement officers authorized to enforce immigration laws be in place;

(xi) A listing by position (title and name when available) of the Service officers authorized to provide operational direction to State or local law enforcement officers assisting in a Federal response pursuant to section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8);

(xii) A requirement that a State or local law enforcement agency maintain records of operational expenditures incurred as a result of supporting the Federal response to a mass influx of aliens;

(xiii) Provisions concerning State or local law enforcement officer use of Federal property or facilities, if any;

(xiv) A requirement that any department, agency, or establishment whose State or local law enforcement officer is performing Service officer or employee functions shall cooperate fully in any Federal investigation related to allegations of misconduct or wrongdoing in conjunction with such functions, or to the written agreement; and

(xv) A procedure by which the appropriate law enforcement agency, department, or establishment will be notified that the Attorney General has made a determination under section 103(a)(8) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1103(a)(8), to authorize State or local law enforcement officers to exercise Federal immigration enforcement authority under the provisions of the respective agreements.

(4) The Attorney General may abbreviate or waive any of the training required pursuant to a written agreement regarding assistance under § 65.83(d) of this chapter, including contingency agreements, in the event that the number of State or local law enforcement officers available to respond in an expeditious manner to urgent and quickly developing events during a declared mass influx of aliens is insufficient to protect public safety, public health, or national security. Such officers still would be required to adhere to applicable policies and standards of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The decision to abbreviate or waive these training requirements is at the sole discretion of the Attorney General.

(b) A reimbursement agreement shall contain the procedures under which the State or local government is to obtain reimbursement for its assistance. A reimbursement agreement shall include the title of the official to whom claims are to be submitted, the intervals at which claims are to be submitted, a description of the supporting documentation to be submitted, and any limitations on the total amount of reimbursement that will be provided. Grants and cooperative agreements shall be made and administered in accordance with the uniform procedures in part 66 of this title.

(c) In exigent circumstances, the Attorney General may agree to provide funding to a State or local government without a written agreement. A reimbursement agreement, grant, or cooperative agreement conforming to the specifications in this section shall be reduced to writing as soon as practicable.
