(1) Be a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States as of the date of application;

(2) Meet the requirements for admission as a trainee of the State or local police force to which the participant will be assigned if selected, including achievement of satisfactory scores on any applicable examination, except that failure to meet the age requirement for a trainee of the State or local police force shall not disqualify the applicant if the applicant will be of sufficient age upon completing an undergraduate course of study;

(3) Possess the necessary mental and physical characteristics to discharge effectively the duties of a law enforcement officer;

(4) Be of good character and demonstrate sincere motivation and dedication to law enforcement and public service;

(5) In the case of an undergraduate, agree in writing that the participant will complete an educational course of study leading to the award of a baccalaureate degree and will then accept an appointment and complete four years of service as an officer in the State police or in a local police department within the State;

(6) In the case of a participant desiring to undertake or continue graduate study, agree in writing that the participant will accept an appointment and complete 4 years of service as an officer in the State police or in a local police department within the State before undertaking or continuing graduate study;

(7) Contract, with the consent of the participant's parent or guardian if the participant is a minor, to serve four years as an officer in the State police or in a local police department, if an appointment is offered; and

(8) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section, be without previous law enforcement experience.

(i) Until September 13, 1999, up to ten percent of the applicants accepted into the State Police Corps program may be persons who have had some law enforcement experience and/or have demonstrated special leadership potential and dedication to law enforcement.

(b) According to the Debt Collection Procedures Act (Pub. L. 101-647 as amended), 28 U.S.C. 3201, persons who have incurred a court judgment in favor of the United States creating a lien against their property arising from a civil or criminal proceeding regarding a debt are precluded from receiving Federal funds (including Police Corps funds) until the judgment lien has been paid in full or otherwise satisfied.

(c) Educational assistance under the Police Corps Act for any course of study also is available to a dependent child of a law enforcement officer:

(1) Who is a member of a State or local police force or is a Federal criminal investigator or uniformed police officer;

(2) Who is not a participant in the Police Corps program, but

(3) Who serves in a State for which the Director has approved a Police Corps plan, and

(4) Who is killed in the course of performing policing duties.

(i) For purposes of this assistance, a dependent child means a natural or adopted child or stepchild of a law enforcement officer who at the time of the officer's death was no more than 21 years old or, if older than 21 years, was in fact dependent on the child's parents for at least one-half of the child's support (excluding educational expenses), as determined by the Director based on a review of any available documentation.

(ii) The educational assistance available under this subsection is subject to the same dollar limitations set forth in § 92.4, but carries no police service obligation, repayment contingencies, or requirement for approval of a course of study.
