##### § 802.24 Purpose and scope.

(a) These regulations state the procedures which the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency ("CSOSA" or "Agency") and the District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency ("PSA" or "Agency") follow in response to a demand from a Federal, state, or local administrative body for the production and disclosure of material in connection with a proceeding to which the Agency is not a party.

(b) These regulations do not apply to congressional requests. Neither do these regulations apply in the case of an employee making an appearance solely in his or her private capacity in judicial or administrative proceedings that do not relate to the Agency (such as cases arising out of traffic accidents, domestic relations, etc.).

(c) This part is not intended and does not create and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States or specifically CSOSA or PSA.
