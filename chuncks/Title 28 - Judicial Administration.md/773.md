### PART 8 - FORFEITURE AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN STATUTES
#### Subpart A - Seizure and Forfeiture of Property
##### § 8.11 Interplay of administrative and criminal judicial forfeiture proceedings.

An administrative forfeiture proceeding pending against seized or restrained property does not bar the Government from alleging that the same property is forfeitable in a criminal case. Notwithstanding the fact that an allegation of forfeiture has been included in a criminal indictment or information, the property may be administratively forfeited in a parallel proceeding.
