## Chapter VIII - Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia
### PART 802 - DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS
#### Subpart A - General
##### § 802.1 Introduction.

(a) This part contains regulations of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia ("CSOSA" or "Agency") and the District of Columbia Pretrial Services Agency ("PSA" or "Agency"), which implement the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, and the Privacy Act (PA), 5 U.S.C. 552a. The Agency provides for the disclosure and production of records in response to FOIA/PA requests, a demand from a court, or other non-congressional authority in connection with a proceeding to which the Agency is not a party. Due to CSOSA's nature as a federal agency with a local mission connected to the District of Columbia, exemption protections, including exclusions, are allowed under the FOIA and other safeguard requirements may be applied under the PA.

(b) It is the policy of CSOSA that all employees of CSOSA and PSA (collectively the "Agency") are to submit all FOIA/PA requests to the Office of General Counsel ("OGC"). The OGC shall make release determinations under either the FOIA/PA pursuant to the procedures set forth in sections §§ 802.6, 802.7, 802.8, 802.14, 802.15, and 802.16.
