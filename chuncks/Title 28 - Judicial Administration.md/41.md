(1) The OIG refers to DOJ-OPR allegations of misconduct within DOJ-OPR's jurisdiction and may refer to another component the investigation of an allegation of misconduct on the part of an employee of that component;

(2) The OIG may refer to a Department component's internal affairs office allegations of misconduct within that office's jurisdiction or may investigate such allegations on its own;
