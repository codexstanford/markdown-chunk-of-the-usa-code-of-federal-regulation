##### § 2.16 Parole of prisoner in state, local, or territorial institution.

(a) Any person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment for any offense against the United States, but who is confined therefor in a state reformatory or other state or territorial institution, shall be eligible for parole by the Commission on the same terms and conditions, by the same authority, and subject to recommittal for the violation of such parole, as though he were confined in a Federal penitentiary, reformatory, or other correctional institution.

(b) Federal prisoners serving concurrent state and Federal sentences in state, local, or territorial institutions shall be furnished upon request parole application forms. Upon receipt of the application and any supplementary classification material submitted by the institution, parole consideration shall be made by an examiner panel of the appropriate region on the record only. If such prisoner is released from his state sentence prior to a Federal grant of parole, he shall be given a personal hearing as soon as feasible after receipt at a Federal institution.

(c) Prisoners who are serving Federal sentences exclusively but who are being boarded in State, local, or territorial institutions may be provided hearings at such facilities or may be transferred by the Bureau of Prisons to Federal Institutions for hearings by examiner panels of the Commission.
