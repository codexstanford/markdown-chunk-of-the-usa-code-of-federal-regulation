##### § 42.303 Evaluation of employment opportunities.

(a) A necessary prerequisite to the development and implementation of a satisfactory equal employment opportunity program is the identification and analysis of any problem areas inherent in the utilization or participation of minorities and women in all of the recipient's employment phases (e.g., recruitment, selection, and promotion) and the evaluation of employment opportunities for minorities and women.

(b) In many cases an effective equal employment opportunity program may only be accomplished where the program is coordinated by the recipient agency with the cognizant Office of Personnel Management or similar agency responsible by law, in whole or in part, for the recruitment and selection of entrance candidates and selection of candidates for promotion.

(c) In making the evaluation of employment opportunities, the recipient shall conduct such analysis separately for minorities and women. However, all racial and ethnic data collected to perform an evaluation pursuant to the requirements of this section should be cross classified by sex to ascertain the extent to which minority women or minority men may be underutilized. The evaluation should include but not necessarily be limited to, the following factors:

(1) An analysis of present representation of women and minority persons in all job categories;

(2) An analysis of all recruitment and employment selection procedures for the preceding fiscal year, including such things as position descriptions, application forms, recruitment methods and sources, interview procedures, test administration and test validity, educational prerequisites, referral procedures and final selection methods, to insure that equal employment opportunity is being afforded in all job categories;

(3) An analysis of seniority practices and provisions, upgrading and promotion procedures, transfer procedures (lateral or vertical), and formal and informal training programs during the preceding fiscal year, in order to insure that equal employment opportunity is being afforded;

(4) A reasonable assessment to determine whether minority employment is inhibited by external factors such as the lack of access to suitable housing in the geographical area served by a certain facility or the lack of suitable transportation (public or private) to the workplace.
