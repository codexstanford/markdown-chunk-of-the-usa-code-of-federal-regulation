### PART 76 - RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR ASSESSMENT OF CIVIL PENALTIES FOR POSSESSION OF CERTAIN CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES
#### § 76.26 Sanctions.

(a) As necessary to meet the ends of justice, the Judge may impose sanctions upon any party or a party's counsel, including, but not limited to sanctions based upon the following reasons:

(1) Failure to comply with an order, rule, or procedure governing the proceeding;

(2) Failure to prosecute an action; or

(3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, orderly, or fair conduct of the proceeding.

(b) Any such sanction, including but not limited to those listed in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct.

(c) When a party fails to comply with an order, including an order for taking a deposition, the production of evidence within the party's control, or a request for admission the Judge may, as appropriate under law:

(1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard to the information sought;

(2) In the case of requests for admission as to unprivileged matters, deem admitted each matter of which an admission is requested;

(3) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying upon, testimony relating to the information sought;

(4) Strike any appropriate part of the pleadings or other submissions of the party failing to comply with such order; and

(5) Permit the requesting party to introduce secondary evidence concerning the information sought.

(d) If a party fails to prosecute an action under this part commenced by service of a notice of hearing, the Judge may dismiss the action.

(e) If a respondent who has requested a hearing pursuant to 28 CFR 76.4, and who has been served with a Notice of a Hearing under 28 CFR 76.6, fails to appear at the hearing, absent good cause shown by the respondent, the Judge may issue an initial decision imposing a penalty.

(f) The Judge may refuse to consider any motion, request, response, brief or other document which is not filed in a timely fashion.
