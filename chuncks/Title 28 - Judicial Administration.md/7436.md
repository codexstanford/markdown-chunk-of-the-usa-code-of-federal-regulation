##### § 1100.37 Requirements to train appropriate personnel in identifying and protecting victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons.

(a) The TVPA requires that appropriate DOJ and DOS personnel be trained in identifying victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons and providing for the protection of such victims. These federal personnel will be trained to recognize victims and provide services and protections, as appropriate, in accordance with the TVPA, 42 U.S.C. 10606 and 10607, and other applicable victim-assistance laws. Specifically, the training will include, as applicable:

(1) Procedures and techniques for identifying victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons;

(2) Rights of crime victims, including confidentiality requirements;

(3) Description of the services available to victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons at the investigation, prosecution, and, where applicable, correction stages of the law enforcement process;

(4) Referral services to be provided to victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons;

(5) Benefits and services available to alien victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons regardless of their immigration status;

(6) Particular needs of victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons;

(7) Procedures and techniques for dealing with specialized needs of victims who may face cultural, language, and/or other obstacles that impede their ability to request and obtain available services for themselves; and

(8) Protection obligations of responsible officials under federal law and policies, as these apply to victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons.

(b) Each component of the DOJ and the DOS with program responsibility for victim witness services must provide initial training in the particular needs of victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons, and appropriate federal agencies' responses to such victims; initial training of appropriate agency personnel should be conducted as soon as possible. Thereafter, training must be held on a recurring basis to ensure that victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons receive the rights, protections, and services accorded them under the TVPA and federal victims' rights laws, and the federal policies, procedures, and guidelines implementing the TVPA and other federal victims' rights laws.
