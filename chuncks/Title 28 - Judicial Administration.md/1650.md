##### § 25.57 Erroneous junk or salvage reporting.
###### i.e.

(a) In cases where a vehicle is erroneously reported to have been salvage or junk and subsequently destroyed (, crushed), owners of the legitimate vehicles are encouraged to seek a vehicle inspection in the current state of title whereby inspection officials can verify via hidden VINs the vehicle's true identity. Owners are encouraged to file such inspection reports with the current state of title and to retain such reports so that the vehicle's true history can be documented.

(b) To avoid the possibility of fraud, the operator may not allow any entity to delete a prior report of junk or salvage status.
