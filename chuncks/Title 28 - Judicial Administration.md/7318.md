## Chapter VIII - Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency for the District of Columbia
### PART 812 - COLLECTION AND USE OF DNA INFORMATION
#### § 812.2 Individuals subject to DNA collection.

CSOSA is responsible for collecting a DNA sample from each individual under its supervision who is, or has been, convicted of a qualifying District of Columbia Code offense. Qualifying District of Columbia Code offenses were designated by the Council of the District of Columbia in the "DNA Sample Collection Act of 2001." CSOSA provides a listing of these offenses in the Appendix to this part. The list is presented for informational purposes only. Any future revision to the District of Columbia Code sections designating the qualifying offenses will be effective notwithstanding the timing of a conforming revision of the Appendix by CSOSA. CSOSA may choose not to collect a sample from an individual if it determines that CODIS already contains a DNA analysis for the individual.
