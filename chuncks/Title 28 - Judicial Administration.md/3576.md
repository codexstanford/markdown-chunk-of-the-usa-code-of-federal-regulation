## Chapter I - Department of Justice
### PART 42 - NONDISCRIMINATION; EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY; POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
#### Subpart D - Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs - Implementation of Section 815(c)(1) of the Justice System Improvement Act of 1979
##### § 42.215 Other actions authorized under the JSIA.

(a) The Director of OJARS may, at any time, request the Attorney General to file suit to enforce compliance with section 815(c)(1). OJARS will monitor the litigation through the court docket and liaison with the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. Where the litigation does not result in timely resolution of the matter, and funds have not been suspended pursuant to § 42.215(b), OJARS will institute administrative proceedings unless enjoined from doing so by the court.

(b)(1) Whenever the Attorney General files a civil action alleging a pattern or practice of discriminatory conduct on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex in any program or activity of a State government or unit of local government which State government or unit of local government receives funds made available under the JSIA or the Juvenile Justice Act and the conduct allegedly violates or would violate the provisions of this subpart or section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA and neither party within 45 days after such filing has been granted such preliminary relief with regard to the suspension or payment of funds as may otherwise be available by law, the Director of OJARS shall suspend further payment of any funds under the JSIA and the Juvenile Justice Act to that specific program or activity alleged by the Attorney General to be in violation of the provisions of section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA until such time as the court orders resumption of payment.

(2) The Office expects that preliminary relief authorized by this subsection will not be granted unless the party making application for such relief meets the standards for a preliminary injunction.

(c)(1) Whenever a State government or unit of local government or any officer or employee thereof acting in an official capacity, has engaged or is engaging in any act or practice prohibited by section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA, a civil action may be instituted after exhaustion of administrative remedies by the person aggrieved in an appropriate U.S. District Court or in a State court or general jurisdiction.

(2) Administrative remedies shall be deemed to be exhausted upon the expiration of 60 days after the date the administrative complaint was filed with the Office or any other administrative enforcement agency, unless within such period there has been a determination by the Office or the agency on the merits of the complaint, in which case such remedies shall be deemed exhausted at the time the determination becomes final.

(3) The Attorney General, or a specifically designated assistant for or in the name of the United States may intervene upon timely application in any civil action brought to enforce compliance with section 815(c)(1) of the JSIA if he certifies that the action is of general public importance. In such action the United States shall be entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.
