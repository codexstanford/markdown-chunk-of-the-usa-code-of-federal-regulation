(a) A Federal prisoner serving a maximum term or terms of more than one year imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205 (a) (or pursuant to former 18 U.S.C. 4202) may be released on parole in the discretion of the Commission after completion of one-third of such term or terms, or after completion of ten years of a life sentence or of a sentence of over thirty years.

(b) A Federal prisoner serving a maximum term or terms of more than one year imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205(b)(1) (or pursuant to former 18 U.S.C. 4208(a)(1)) may be released on parole in the discretion of the Commission after completion of the court-designated minimum term, which may be less than but not more than one-third of the maximum sentence imposed.

(c) A Federal prisoner serving a maximum term or terms of more than one year imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205(b)(2) (or pursuant to former 18 U.S.C. 4208(a)(2)) may be released on parole at any time in the discretion of the Commission.

(d) If the Court has imposed a maximum term or terms of more than one year pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 924(a) or 26 U.S.C. 5871 [violation of Federal gun control laws], a Federal prisoner serving such term or terms may be released in the discretion of the Commission as if sentenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205(b)(2). However, if the prisoner's offense was committed on or after October 12, 1984, and the Court imposes a term or terms under 26 U.S.C. 5871, the prisoner is eligible for parole only after service of one-third of such term or terms, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4205(a).

(e) A Federal prisoner serving a maximum term or terms of one year or less is not eligible for parole consideration by the Commission.
