#### Subpart A - United States Code Prisoners and Parolees
##### § 2.33 Release plans.

(a) A grant of parole is conditioned upon the approval of release plans by the Regional Commissioner. In general, the following factors are considered as elements in the prisoner's release plan:

(1) Availability of legitimate employment and an approved residence for the prospective parolee; and

(2) Availability of necessary aftercare for a parolee who is ill or who requires special care.

(b) Generally, parolees will be released only to the place of their legal residence unless the Commission is satisfied that another place of residence will serve the public interest more effectively or will improve the probability of the applicant's readjustment.

(c) Where the circumstances warrant, the Commission on its own motion, or upon recommendation of the probation officer, may require that an advisor who is a responsible, reputable, and law-abiding citizen living in or near the community in which the releasee will reside be available to the releasee. Such advisor shall serve under the direction of and in cooperation with the probation officer to whom the parolee is assigned.

(d) When the prisoner has an unsatisfied fine or restitution order, a reasonable plan for payment [or performance of services, if so ordered by the court] shall, where feasible, be included in the parole release plan.
