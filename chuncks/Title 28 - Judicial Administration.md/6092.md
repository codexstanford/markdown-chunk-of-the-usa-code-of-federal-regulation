##### § 301.204 Continuation of lost-time wages.

(a) Once approved, the inmate shall receive lost-time wages until the inmate:

(1) Is released;

(2) Is transferred to another institution for reasons unrelated to the work injury;

(3) Returns to the pre-injury work assignment;

(4) Is reassigned to another work area or program for reasons unrelated to the sustained work injury, or is placed into Disciplinary Segregation; or,

(5) Refuses to return to a regular work assignment or to a lighter duty work assignment after medical certification of fitness for such duty.

(b) An inmate medically certified as fit for return to work shall sustain no monetary loss due to a required change in work assignment. Where there is no light duty or regular work assignment available at the same rate of pay as the inmate's pre-injury work assignment, the difference shall be paid in lost-time wages. Lost-time wages are paid until a light duty or regular work assignment at the same pay rate as the inmate's pre-injury work assignment is available.
