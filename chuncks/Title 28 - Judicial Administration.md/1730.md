#### § 30.9 How does the Attorney General receive and respond to comments?

(a) The Attorney General follows the procedures in § 30.10 if:

(1) A state office or official is designated to act as a single point of contact between a state process and all federal agencies; and

(2) That office or official transmits a state process recommendation for a program selected under § 30.6.

(b)(1) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit comments from state, areawide, regional, or local officials and entities where there is no state process recommendation.

(2) If a state process recommendation is transmitted by a single point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.

(c) If a state has not established a process, or is unable to submit a state process recommendation, state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities may submit comments either to the applicant or to the Department.

(d) If a program or activity is not selected for a state process, state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities may submit comments either to the applicant or to the Department. In addition, if a state process recommendation for a nonselected program or activity is transmitted to the Department by the single point of contact, the Attorney General follows the procedures of § 30.10 of this part.

(e) The Attorney General considers comments which do not constitute a state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for which the Attorney General is not required to apply the procedures of § 30.10 of this part, when such comments are provided by a single point of contact, by the applicant, or directly to the Department by a commenting party.
