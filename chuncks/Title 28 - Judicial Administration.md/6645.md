(a) The Warden or designee must appoint a postsecondary education coordinator (ordinarily an education staff member) for the institution. The postsecondary education coordinator is responsible for coordinating the institution's postsecondary education program.

(b) An inmate who wishes to participate in a postsecondary education course must apply through the postsecondary education coordinator. If the postsecondary education coordinator determines that the course is appropriate in light of the institution's need for discipline, security, and good order, the inmate may enroll provided that:

(1) The inmate meets eligibility requirements for the course which have been set by the course provider,

(2) The inmate is responsible for payment of any tuition either through personal funds, community resources, or scholarships available to the inmate, and

(3) The unit team determines that the course is appropriate for the inmate's apparent needs.
