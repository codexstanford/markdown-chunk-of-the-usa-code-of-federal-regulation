### PART 813 - GUIDANCE DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES
#### § 813.4 Guidance development process for Pretrial Services Agency (PSA).

Pretrial Services Agency (PSA), an independent agency within CSOSA, has its own guidance or policy development process, coordinated through PSA's Office of Planning, Policy, and Analysis (OPPA). PSA's guidance development process occurs as detailed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section:

(a) PSA's guidance documents are:

(1) Prepared by the responsible PSA Office and issued with the PSA Director's signature;

(2) Remain in effect and active until rescinded, amended, or superseded;

(3) Reviewed by all PSA Deputy Assistant Directors and/or designees;

(4) Prepared using a standard format provided by OPPA; and

(5) Developed using a process that includes planning, development, review, and maintenance in accordance with specified timeframes.

(b) PSA process and procedure documents are:

(1) Coordinated with assistance from OPPA, as appropriate, to avoid duplicative or conflicting procedures;

(2) Tied to a policy, when appropriate;

(3) Developed in collaboration with all stakeholders including the bargaining unit;

(4) Organized in a manner that is readily accessible by those who need it; and

(5) Maintained according to records management standards.

(c) The PSA Director, or his/her designee, may waive or truncate the internal development process where good cause exists, for example where Congress or the executive branch mandates changes within a specified period or allow changes that need to be implemented immediately.

(d) The process set forth in § 813.2(d) and (e) also applies to PSA guidance documents.
