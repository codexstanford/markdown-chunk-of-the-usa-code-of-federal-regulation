### PART 802 - DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS
#### Subpart C - Privacy Act
##### § 802.16 Administrative appeal.

(a) A requester may appeal an Agency initial determination when:

(1) Access to records has been denied in whole or in part; or

(2) It has been determined that no responsive records exist.

(b) Appeals of initial determinations must be made within 30 days of the receipt of the letter denying the request. Both the envelope and the letter of appeal should be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, 633 Indiana Avenue, NW., Room 1220, Washington, DC 20004 and must be clearly marked "Privacy Act Appeal."

(c) The General Counsel will make an appeal determination within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from the date of receipt of the appeal. However, for a good reason, this time limit may be extended. If, after review, the General Counsel determines that additional information should be released, it will accompany the appeal response. If, after review, the General Counsel determines to uphold the initial review, we will inform you of that decision.
