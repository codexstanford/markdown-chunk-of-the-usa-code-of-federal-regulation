#### Subpart D - District of Columbia Supervised Releasees
##### § 2.200 Authority, jurisdiction, and functions of the U.S. Parole Commission with respect to offenders serving terms of supervised release imposed by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.

(a) The U.S. Parole Commission has jurisdiction, pursuant to D.C. Code 24-133(c)(2), over all offenders serving terms of supervised release imposed by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia under the Sentencing Reform Emergency Amendment Act of 2000.

(b) The U.S. Parole Commission shall have and exercise the same authority with respect to a term of supervised release as is vested in the United States district courts by 18 U.S.C. 3583(d) through (i), except that:

(1) The procedures followed by the Commission in exercising that authority shall be those set forth with respect to offenders on federal parole at 18 U.S.C. 4209 through 4215 (Chapter 311 of 18 United States Code); and

(2) An extension of a term of supervised release under subsection (e)(2) of 18 U.S.C. 3583 may only be ordered by the Superior Court upon motion from the Commission.

(c) Within the District of Columbia, supervision of offenders on terms of supervised release under the Commission's jurisdiction is carried out by the Community Supervision Officers of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency (CSOSA), pursuant to D.C. Code 24-133(c)(2). Outside the District of Columbia, supervision is carried out by United States Probation Officers pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3655. For the purpose of this subpart, any reference to a "supervision officer" shall include both a Community Supervision Officer of CSOSA and a United States Probation Officer in the case of a releasee who is under supervision outside the District of Columbia.
