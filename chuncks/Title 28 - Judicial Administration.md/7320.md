(a) DNA samples will be collected, handled, preserved, and submitted to the FBI in accordance with FBI guidelines.

(b) CSOSA has the authority to use such means as are reasonably necessary to collect a sample from an individual who refuses to cooperate in the collection of the sample. Unless CSOSA determines that there are mitigating circumstances, CSOSA will consider that an individual is refusing to cooperate if:

(1) The individual is being ordered or transferred to CSOSA's supervision, but fails to report to CSOSA for collection of the sample within 15 business days of being sentenced to probation or being discharged from a correctional institution; or

(2) The individual is already under CSOSA supervision and has been notified by his or her Community Supervision Officer of the time to report for collection of the sample, but fails to report for collection of the sample; or

(3) The individual has reported to CSOSA for collection of the sample, but fails to provide the sample after being given a minimum of one hour to do so; or

(4) The individual specifically states that he or she will not cooperate.

(c) When an individual has refused to cooperate in the collection of the sample, CSOSA deems the following to be reasonably necessary means for obtaining the sample:

(1) Impose administrative sanctions;

(2) Request a revocation hearing by the releasing authority; and/or

(3) Refer the individual who refuses to cooperate for criminal prosecution for a class A misdemeanor pursuant to section 4(a)(5) of the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135b(a)(5)).
