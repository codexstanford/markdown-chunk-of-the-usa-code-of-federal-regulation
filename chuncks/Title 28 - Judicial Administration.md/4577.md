(b) The Special Counsel shall, within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of receipt of the charge:

(1) Determine whether there is a reasonable cause to believe the charge is true and whether to bring a complaint respecting the charge with the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer within the 120-day period; or,

(2) Notify the party within the 120-day period that the Special Counsel will not file a complaint with the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer within the 120-day period.

(c) The charging individual may file a complaint directly with the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer within ninety (90) days after the date of receipt of notice that the Special Counsel will not be filing a complaint within the 120-day period. However, the Special Counsel's failure to file a complaint within the 120-day period will not affect the right of the Special Counsel to investigate the charge or bring a complaint within the 90-day period.
