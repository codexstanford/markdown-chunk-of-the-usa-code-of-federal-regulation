### PART 97 - STANDARDS FOR PRIVATE ENTITIES PROVIDING PRISONER OR DETAINEE SERVICES
#### § 97.19 Immediate notification of local law enforcement in the event of an escape.

Private prisoner transport companies must be sufficiently equipped to provide immediate notification to law enforcement in the event of a prisoner escape. Law enforcement officials must receive notification no later than 15 minutes after an escape is detected unless the company can demonstrate that extenuating circumstances necessitated a longer delay. In the event of the escape of a violent prisoner, a private prisoner transport company must:

(a) Ensure the safety and security of the remaining prisoners;

(b) Provide notification within 15 minutes to the appropriate State and local law enforcement officials;

(c) Provide notification as soon as practicable to the governmental entity or the privately run incarceration facility that contracted with the transport company; and

(d) Provide complete descriptions of the escapee and the circumstances surrounding the escape to State and local law enforcement officials if needed.
