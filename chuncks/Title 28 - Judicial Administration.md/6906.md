###### § 552.31 Negotiations.

The Warden is not ordinarily involved directly in the negotiation process. Instead, this responsibility is ordinarily assigned to a team of individuals specifically trained in hostage negotiation techniques.

(a) Negotiators have no decision-making authority in hostage situations, but rather serve as intermediaries between hostage takers and command center staff.

(b) During the negotiation process, the following items are non-negotiable: release of captors from custody, providing of weapons, exchange of hostages, and immunity from prosecution.
