(a) There must be a separate power control for each engine.

(b) Power controls must be arranged to allow ready synchronization of all engines by-

(1) Separate control of each engine; and

(2) Simultaneous control of all engines.

(c) Each power control must provide a positive and immediately responsive means of controlling its engine.

(d) Each fluid injection control other than fuel system control must be in the corresponding power control. However, the injection system pump may have a separate control.

(e) If a power control incorporates a fuel shutoff feature, the control must have a means to prevent the inadvertent movement of the control into the shutoff position. The means must-

(1) Have a positive lock or stop at the idle position; and

(2) Require a separate and distinct operation to place the control in the shutoff position.

(f) For rotorcraft to be certificated for a 30-second OEI power rating, a means must be provided to automatically activate and control the 30-second OEI power and prevent any engine from exceeding the installed engine limits associated with the 30-second OEI power rating approved for the rotorcraft.
