(b) If, in the Administrator's judgment, the public agency has not made sufficient progress toward implementation of an approved project within the times specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator begins termination proceedings under subpart E of this part.

(c) The authority to impose a PFC following approval shall automatically expire without further action by the Administrator on the following dates:

(1) 3 years after the charge effective date; or 3 years after the FAA's decision on the application if the charge effective date is more than 60 days after the decision date unless-

(i) The public agency has filed an application for approval to use PFC revenue for an eligible project that is pending before the FAA;

(ii) An application to use PFC revenue has been approved; or

(iii) A request for extension (not to exceed 2 years) to submit an application for project approval, under § 158.35, has been granted; or

(2) 5 years after the charge effective date; or 5 years after the FAA's decision on the application (if the charge effective date is more than 60 days after the decision date) unless the public agency has obtained project approval.

(d) If the authority to impose a PFC expires under paragraph (c) of this section, the public agency must provide the FAA with a list of the air carriers and foreign air carriers operating at the airport and all other collecting carriers that have remitted PFC revenue to the public agency in the preceding 12 months. The FAA notifies each of the listed carriers to terminate PFC collection no later than 30 days after the date of notification by the FAA.
