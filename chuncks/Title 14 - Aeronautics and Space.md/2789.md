####### § 29.521 Float landing conditions.

If certification for float operation (including float amphibian operation) is requested, the rotorcraft, with floats, must be designed to withstand the following loading conditions (where the limit load factor is determined under § 29.473(b) or assumed to be equal to that determined for wheel landing gear):

(a) Up-load conditions in which-

(1) A load is applied so that, with the rotorcraft in the static level attitude, the resultant water reaction passes vertically through the center of gravity; and

(2) The vertical load prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is applied simultaneously with an aft component of 0.25 times the vertical component

(b) A side load condition in which-

(1) A vertical load of 0.75 times the total vertical load specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is divided equally among the floats; and

(2) For each float, the load share determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, combined with a total side load of 0.25 times the total vertical load specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, is applied to that float only.
