(e) Both Group II air carriers and Group III air carriers shall maintain the following subfunctions:

This function shall include all expenses chargeable directly to activities contributing to the comfort, safety and convenience of passengers while in flight and when flights are interrupted. It shall not include expenses incurred in enplaning or deplaning passengers, or in securing and selling passenger transportation and caring for passengers prior to entering a flight status. Such expenses shall be included in functions 6400 Aircraft and Traffic Servicing and 6700 Promotion and Sales, respectively.

(a) This function shall include the compensation of ground personnel and other expenses incurred on the ground incident to the protection and control of the in-flight movement of aircraft, scheduling and preparing aircraft operational crews for flight assignment, handling and servicing aircraft while in line operation, servicing and handling traffic on the ground, subsequent to the issuance of documents establishing the air carrier's responsibility to provide air transportation, and in-flight expenses of handling and protecting all nonpassenger traffic including passenger baggage.

(b) This function shall include only those aircraft servicing and cleaning expenses which are incurred as an incidental routine during the normal productive use of aircraft in line operations. It shall not include expenses incurred in the repair and maintenance of property and equipment, or in checking or inspecting property and equipment in accordance with prescribed operational standards when such activities are not an incidental routine during the normal productive use of aircraft. Such expenses shall be included in function 5400 Maintenance.

(c) This function shall not include expenses incurred in securing traffic, arranging aircraft space for traffic sold or in issuing documents confirming traffic sales and establishing the air carrier's responsibilities to provide air transportation. Such expenses shall be included in function 6700 Promotion and Sales. However, for purposes of this system of accounts, expenses attributable to the operation of airport traffic offices, excluding reservation centers, shall be included in this function. Expenses attributable to the operation of reservation or aircraft space control centers shall be included in function 6700 Promotion and Sales regardless of the location at which incurred.

(d) Group III air carriers shall further subdivide this function as follows:

(a) This function shall include expenses incurred in creating public preference for the air carrier and its services; stimulating the development of the air transport market; and promoting the air carrier or developing air transportation generally.

(b) It shall also include the compensation of personnel and other expenses incident to documenting sales; expenses incident to controlling and arranging or confirming aircraft space for traffic sold; expenses incurred in direct sales solicitation and selling of aircraft space; and expenses incurred in developing tariffs and schedules for publication.

(c) This function shall not include expenses incurred in handling traffic subsequent to the issuance of documents establishing the air carrier's responsibility to provide air transportation which shall be included in functions 5500 Passenger Service and 6400 Aircraft and Traffic Servicing. However, for purposes of this system of accounts, expenses attributable to the operation of airport traffic offices, excluding reservation centers, shall be included in function 6400 Aircraft and Traffic Servicing. Expenses attributable to the operation of reservation or aircraft space control centers shall be included in function 6700 Promotion and Sales regardless of the location at which incurred.

(d) Group III air carriers shall subdivide this function as follows:

(a) This function shall include expenses of a general corporate nature and expenses incurred in performing activities which contribute to more than a single operating function such as general financial accounting activities, purchasing activities, representation at law, and other general operational administration, which are not directly applicable to a particular function.

(b) This function shall not include expenses incurred directly in promoting traffic or in promoting relations of the air carrier generally with the public which shall be included in function 6700 Promotion and Sales. Nor shall this function include expenses, regularly applicable in large part to a specific function, which contribute only incidentally, or in small amount, to various other functions. Such expenses when of such size as will not distort the function to which predominantly related, shall be included in the specific function to which regularly related. However, expenses of a general administrative character and of significant amount regularly contributing to operating functions generally shall be included in this function.

This function shall include all charges to expense to record losses suffered through current exhaustion of the serviceability of property and equipment due to wear and tear from use and the action of time and the elements, which are not replaced by current repairs, as well as losses in serviceability occasioned by obsolescence, supersession, discoveries, change in popular demand or action by public authority. It shall also include charges for the amortization of capitalized developmental and preoperating costs, leased property under capital leases, and other intangible assets applicable to the performance of air transportation. (See sections 6-1696, 1830 and 1890.)

(a) This function shall include all expense items applicable to the generation of transport-related revenues included in section 9, Function 4800.

(b) Such expense related to services of a magnitude or scope beyond an incidental adjunct to air transportation services shall not be included in this function (see section 1-6(b)). Expenses applicable to the generation of such revenues shall be included in profit and loss classification 8100, Nonoperating Income and Expense-Net, and the accounting modified to conform with that of a nontransport division whether or not the service is organized as a nontransport division.

(c) This function shall also include expenses representing increases in costs incurred in common with the air transport service, to the extent such increases result from the added transport-related services, as well as a pro rata share of the costs incurred by the air carrier in operating facilities which are used jointly with others. As a general rule, this function shall not include those expenses, other than joint facilities, costs, which would remain as an essential part of the air transport services if the transport-related services were terminated.
