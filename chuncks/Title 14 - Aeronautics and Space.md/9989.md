(iii) In Category C markets, carriers shall continue to file all passenger tariffs, except as provided in § 293.10(b);

(2) The Assistant Secretary will list country-pair markets falling in Categories A and C, taking into consideration the factors in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section.
