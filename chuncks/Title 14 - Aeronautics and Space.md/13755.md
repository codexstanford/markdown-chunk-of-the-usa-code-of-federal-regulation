##### § 1245.109 Assignment of title to NASA.

(a) The instrument of waiver set forth in § 1245.115(c) shall be voided by NASA with respect to the domestic title to any invention for which a patent application has not been filed within 1 year (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from notification to NASA of election of title, as required by § 1245.104(c)(2), for an advanced waiver pursuant to § 1245.104, or within 1 year from the granting of a waiver for an individual invention granted pursuant to § 1245.105.

(b) The instrument of waiver set forth in § 1245.115(c) shall be voided by NASA with respect to title in any foreign country for which waiver has been granted pursuant to § 1245.106, if a patent application has not been filed in that country (or in the European Patent Office or under the Patent Cooperation Treaty and that country designated) within either 10 months (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from the date a corresponding U.S. patent application has been filed or 6 months (or a reasonable time thereafter for good cause shown) from the date a license is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.

(c) In any country in which the waiver recipient decides not to continue prosecution of any application, to pay maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceedings on a patent on a waived invention, the waiver recipient shall notify the patent representative within sufficient time for NASA to continue prosecution, pay the maintenance fee or defend the reexamination or opposition, and upon written request, convey title to NASA and execute all papers necessary for NASA to proceed with the appropriate action.
