(a) Except as provided in § 1206.603(b) and § 1206.603(c), the Agency shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request that seeks its commercial information whenever required under § 1206.600(a).

(3) A description of the procedures for objecting to the release of the possibly confidential information under § 1206.602;

(4) A time limit for responding to the Agency that shall not exceed 10 working days from the date of the letter sent to the submitter by the FOIA Office or publication of the notice (as set forth in § 1206.603(b)) to object to the release and to explain the basis for the objection;

(5) Notice that the information contained in the submitter's objections may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA;

(6) Notice that the Agency, not the submitter, is responsible for deciding whether the information shall be released or withheld;
