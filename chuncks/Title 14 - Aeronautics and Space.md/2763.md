####### § 29.493 Braked roll conditions.

Under braked roll conditions with the shock absorbers in their static positions-

(a) The limit vertical load must be based on a load factor of at least-

(1) 1.33, for the attitude specified in § 29.479(a)(1); and

(2) 1.0, for the attitude specified in § 29.479(a)(2); and

(b) The structure must be designed to withstand, at the ground contact point of each wheel with brakes, a drag load of at least the lesser of-

(1) The vertical load multiplied by a coefficient of friction of 0.8; and

(2) The maximum value based on limiting brake torque.
