###### Powerplant Fire Protection
####### § 29.1195 Fire extinguishing systems.

(a) Each turbine engine powered rotorcraft and Category A reciprocating engine powered rotorcraft, and each Category B reciprocating engine powered rotorcraft with engines of more than 1,500 cubic inches must have a fire extinguishing system for the designated fire zones. The fire extinguishing system for a powerplant must be able to simultaneously protect all zones of the powerplant compartment for which protection is provided.

(b) For multiengine powered rotorcraft, the fire extinguishing system, the quantity of extinguishing agent, and the rate of discharge must-

(1) For each auxiliary power unit and combustion equipment, provide at least one adequate discharge; and

(2) For each other designated fire zone, provide two adequate discharges.

(c) For single engine rotorcraft, the quantity of extinguishing agent and the rate of discharge must provide at least one adequate discharge for the engine compartment.

(d) It must be shown by either actual or simulated flight tests that under critical airflow conditions in flight the discharge of the extinguishing agent in each designated fire zone will provide an agent concentration capable of extinguishing fires in that zone and of minimizing the probability of reignition.
