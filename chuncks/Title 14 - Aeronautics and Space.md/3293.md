###### § 33.64 Pressurized engine static parts.

(a) Strength. The applicant must establish by test, validated analysis, or a combination of both, that all static parts subject to significant gas or liquid pressure loads for a stabilized period of one minute will not:

(1) Exhibit permanent distortion beyond serviceable limits or exhibit leakage that could create a hazardous condition when subjected to the greater of the following pressures:

(i) 1.1 times the maximum working pressure;

(ii) 1.33 times the normal working pressure; or

(iii) 35 kPa (5 p.s.i.) above the normal working pressure.

(2) Exhibit fracture or burst when subjected to the greater of the following pressures:

(i) 1.15 times the maximum possible pressure;

(ii) 1.5 times the maximum working pressure; or

(iii) 35 kPa (5 p.s.i.) above the maximum possible pressure.

(b) Compliance with this section must take into account:

(1) The operating temperature of the part;

(2) Any other significant static loads in addition to pressure loads;

(3) Minimum properties representative of both the material and the processes used in the construction of the part; and

(4) Any adverse geometry conditions allowed by the type design.
