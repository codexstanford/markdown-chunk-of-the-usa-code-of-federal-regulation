###### § 35.37 Fatigue limits and evaluation.

This section does not apply to fixed-pitch wood propellers of conventional design.

(a) Fatigue limits must be established by tests, or analysis based on tests, for propeller:

(1) Hubs.

(2) Blades.

(3) Blade retention components.

(4) Components which are affected by fatigue loads and which are shown under § 35.15 to have a fatigue failure mode leading to hazardous propeller effects.

(b) The fatigue limits must take into account:

(1) All known and reasonably foreseeable vibration and cyclic load patterns that are expected in service; and

(2) Expected service deterioration, variations in material properties, manufacturing variations, and environmental effects.

(c) A fatigue evaluation of the propeller must be conducted to show that hazardous propeller effects due to fatigue will be avoided throughout the intended operational life of the propeller on either:

(1) The intended airplane by complying with § 23.2400(c) or § 25.907 of this chapter, as applicable; or

(2) A typical airplane.
