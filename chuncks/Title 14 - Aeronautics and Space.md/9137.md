### Subchapter N - War Risk Insurance
#### PART 198 - AVIATION INSURANCE
##### § 198.9 Applicant for insurance.

(a) Application for premium or non-premium insurance must be made in accordance with the applicable form supplied by the FAA.

(b) Each applicant for insurance with the premium under this part must submit to the FAA with its application a letter describing in detail the operations in which the aircraft is or will be engaged and stating the type of insurance coverage being sought and the reason it is being sought. The applicant must also submit any other information deemed pertinent by the FAA.

(c) Each applicant for premium or non-premium insurance must, upon request by the FAA, submit to the FAA evidence that commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms for each flight or ground operation for which insurance is sought. Each aircraft operator who has a standby non-premium insurance policy must, upon request by the FAA, submit evidence to the FAA that commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms before the FAA activates that policy. The adequacy of the evidence submitted is determined solely by the FAA.

(d) The standby non-premium policy issued to the aircraft operator does not provide actual coverage until formally activated by the FAA.
