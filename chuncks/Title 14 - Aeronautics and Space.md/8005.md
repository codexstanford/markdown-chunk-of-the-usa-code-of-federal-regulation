(b) The equipment, personnel, technical data, and housing and facilities required for the certificate and rating, or for an additional rating, must be in place for inspection at the time of certification or rating approval by the FAA. However, the requirement to have the equipment in place at the time of initial certification or rating approval may be met if the applicant has a contract acceptable to the FAA with another person to make the equipment available to the repair station at any time it is necessary when the relevant work is being performed.

(c) In addition to meeting the other applicable requirements for a repair station certificate and rating, an applicant for a repair station certificate and rating located outside the United States must meet the following requirements:

(1) The applicant must show that the repair station certificate and/or rating is necessary for maintaining or altering the following:

(i) U.S.-registered aircraft and articles for use on U.S.-registered aircraft, or

(ii) Foreign-registered aircraft operated under the provisions of part 121 or part 135, and articles for use on these aircraft.

(2) The applicant must show that the fee prescribed by the FAA has been paid.

(d) An application for an additional rating, amended repair station certificate, or renewal of a repair station certificate must be made in a format acceptable to the FAA. The application must include only that information necessary to substantiate the change or renewal of the certificate.

(e) The FAA may deny an application for a repair station certificate if the FAA finds that:

(1) The applicant holds a repair station certificate in the process of being revoked, or previously held a repair station certificate that was revoked;

(2) The applicant intends to fill or fills a management position with an individual who exercised control over or who held the same or a similar position with a certificate holder whose repair station certificate was revoked, or is in the process of being revoked, and that individual materially contributed to the circumstances causing the revocation or causing the revocation process; or

(3) An individual who will have control over or substantial ownership interest in the applicant had the same or similar control or interest in a certificate holder whose repair station certificate was revoked, or is in the process of being revoked, and that individual materially contributed to the circumstances causing the revocation or causing the revocation process.

(f) If the FAA revokes a repair station certificate, an individual described in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section is subject to an order under the procedures set forth in 14 CFR 13.20, finding that the individual materially contributed to the circumstances causing the revocation or causing the revocation process.
