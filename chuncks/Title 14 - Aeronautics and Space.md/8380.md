##### Subpart E - Nondiscrimination in Airport Aid Program
###### § 152.423 Investigation and enforcement.
####### Investigations and informal resolutions.

(b)The Departmental Office of Civil Rights will make a prompt investigation whenever a complaint, compliance review, report, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this subpart. The procedures in 49 CFR part 21, augmented as appropriate by the investigative procedures of part 13 of this chapter, will be followed, except that-

(1) Compliance with a regulation of the Department applicable to minority business enterprise will be investigated and enforced through the procedures contained in that regulation; and

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, allegations of noncompliance with regulations governing equal employment opportunity of another Federal agency or a State or local agency, will be referred, for investigation and enforcement, to the Federal agency or, in the discretion of the Departmental Office of Civil Rights, to the State or local agency.

(c) When the FAA (under section 30 of the AADA) and another Federal agency, a referral agency recognized by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or a court have concurrent jurisdiction over a matter-

(1) If the other agency or court makes a finding on the record that noncompliance or discrimination has occurred, the FAA will accept the finding, and determine what sanctions or remedies are appropriate under section 30 as a result of the finding, after permitting the party against whom the finding was made to be heard on the determination of the sanctions or remedies; or

(2) If it appears that delay, through referral to another agency, will result in the continued expenditure of Federal funds under this part without compliance with this subpart, the Secretary may-

(i) Investigate the matter;

(ii) Make a determination as to compliance with section 30; and

(iii) Impose appropriate sanctions and remedies.

(d) Nothing in this section shall preclude the Director of the Departmental Office of Civil Rights from initiating an investigation when it appears that the investigation of the complaint may reveal a pattern or practice of discrimination or noncompliance with the requirements of this subpart in the employment practices of a grantee or other covered organization.
