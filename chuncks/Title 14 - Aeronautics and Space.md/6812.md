###### § 125.111 General.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no certificate holder may use an airplane powered by airplane engines rated at more than 600 horsepower each for maximum continuous operation unless that airplane meets the requirements of §§ 125.113 through 125.181.

(c) This section does not apply to any airplane certificated under-

(1) Part 4b of the Civil Air Regulations in effect after October 31, 1946;
