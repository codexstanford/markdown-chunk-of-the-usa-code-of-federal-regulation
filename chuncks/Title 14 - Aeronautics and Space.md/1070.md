(c) A person who has altered the design of a type certificated aircraft may apply for an experimental certificate for the altered aircraft to be used for market surveys, sales demonstrations, or customer crew training if the basic aircraft, before alteration, was type certificated in the normal, utility, acrobatic, or transport category.

(d) An applicant for an experimental certificate under this section is entitled to that certificate if, in addition to meeting the requirements of § 21.193-
