(a) Runway ends-a stabilized area the width of the runway and extending 100 to 150 feet from the end of the runway.

(b) Holding aprons-a stabilized area up to 50 feet from the edge of the pavement.

(c) Taxiway intersections-a stabilized area 25 feet on each side of the taxiway and extending 300 feet from the intersection.

(d) Taxiway (continuous movement of aircraft)-dense turf 25 feet on each side of the taxiway, or in a geographic area where dense turf cannot be established, stabilization.
