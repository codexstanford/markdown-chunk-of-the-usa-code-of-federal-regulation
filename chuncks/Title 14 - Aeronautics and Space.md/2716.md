####### § 29.85 Balked landing: Category A.

For Category A rotorcraft, the balked landing path with the critical engine inoperative must be established so that-

(a) The transition from each stage of the maneuver to the next stage can be made smoothly and safely;

(b) From the LDP on the approach path selected by the applicant, a safe climbout can be made at speeds allowing compliance with the climb requirements of § 29.67(a)(1) and (2); and

(c) The rotorcraft does not descend below 15 feet above the landing surface. For elevated heliport operations, descent may be below the level of the landing surface provided the deck edge clearance of § 29.60 is maintained and the descent (loss of height) below the landing surface is determined.
