(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each sponsor shall require each of its aviation related activities on its airport, that is not subject to an affirmative action plan, regulatory goals and timetables, or other mechanism which provides short and long-range goals for equal employment opportunity, to take affirmative action steps and cause them to similarly require affirmative action steps of their covered suborganizations, as follows:

(1) Each aviation related activity or covered suborganization with less than 50 but more than 14 employees, must take the affirmative action steps enumerated in § 152.409(b)(3), as appropriate.

(1) The contractor must establish and maintain a current list of minority and female recruitment sources; provide written notification to these recruitment sources and to community organizations when employment opportunities are available; and maintain a record of each organization's response.

(2) The contractor must maintain a current file of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of each minority and female walk-in applicant and each referral from a union, a recruitment source, or community organization and the action taken with respect to each individual. Where an individual is sent to the union hiring hall for referral, but not referred back to the contractor, or, if referred, not employed by the contractor, this shall be documented.

(iii) By publicizing it in the company newspaper, report, or other publication; and

(iv) By specific review of the policy with all management personnel and with all employees at least once a year.

(4) The contractor must disseminate the contractors's equal employment opportunity policy externally-

(ii) By providing written notification to, or participating in discussions with, other contractors and subcontractors with whom the contractor does business.

(5) The contractor must direct its recruitment efforts to minority and female organizations, to schools with minority and female students, and to organizations which recruit and train minorities and women, in the contractor's recruitment area.

(6) The contractor must encourage present minority and female employees to recruit other minorities and women.
