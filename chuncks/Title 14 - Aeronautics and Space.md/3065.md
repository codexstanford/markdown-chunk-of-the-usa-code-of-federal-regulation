(a) When laboratory tests of the electrical system are conducted-

(1) The tests must be performed on a mock-up using the same generating equipment used in the rotorcraft;

(2) The equipment must simulate the electrical characteristics of the distribution wiring and connected loads to the extent necessary for valid test results; and

(3) Laboratory generator drives must simulate the prime movers on the rotorcraft with respect to their reaction to generator loading, including loading due to faults.

(b) For each flight condition that cannot be simulated adequately in the laboratory or by ground tests on the rotorcraft, flight tests must be made.
