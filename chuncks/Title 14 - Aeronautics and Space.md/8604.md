(iii) Change the scope of an approved project,

(iv) Delete an approved project, or

(v) Establish a new class of carriers under § 158.11 or amend any such class previously approved.

(2) A public agency may not amend the FAA's decision with respect to an approved PFC to add projects, change an approved project to a different facility type, or alter an approved project to accomplish a different purpose.

(b) The public agency must file a request to the Administrator to amend the FAA's decision with respect to an approved PFC. The request must include or demonstrate:

(1)(i) Further consultation with the air carriers and foreign air carriers and seek public comment in accordance with §§ 158.23 and 158.24 when applying for those requests to:

(A) Amend the approved PFC amount for a project by more than 25 percent of the original approved amount if the amount was $1,000,000 or greater,

(B) Amend the approved PFC amount for a project by any percentage if the original approved amount was below $1,000,000 and the amended approved amount is $1,000,000 or greater,

(C) Change the scope of a project, or

(D) Increase the PFC level to be collected from each passenger.

(ii) No further consultation with air carriers and foreign air carriers or public comment is required by a public agency in accordance with §§ 158.23 and 158.24 when applying for an amendment in the following situations:

(A) To institute a decrease in the level of PFC to be collected from each passenger;

(B) To institute a decrease in the total PFC revenue;

(C) To institute an increase of 25 percent or less of the original approved amount if the amount was more than $1,000,000; or

(D) To institute an increase of any amount if the original approved amount of the project was less than $1,000,000 and if the amended approved amount of the project remains below $1,000,000; or

(E) To establish a new class of carriers under § 158.11 or amend any such class previously approved; or

(F) To delete an approved project.

(2) A copy of any comments received from the processes in paragraph (b)(1)(A) of this section for the carrier consultation and the opportunity for public comment in accordance with §§ 158.23 and 158.24;

(3) The public agency's reasons for continuing despite any objections;

(4) A description of the proposed amendment;

(5) Justification, if the amendment involves an increase in the PFC amount for a project by more than 25 percent of the original approved amount if that amount is $1,000,000 or greater, an increase in the PFC amount by any percentage if the original approved amount was less than $1,000,000 and the amended approved amount is $1,000,000 or greater, a change in the approved project scope, or any increase in the approved PFC level to be collected from each passenger.

(6) A description of how each project meets the requirements of § 158.17(b), for each project proposed for an increase of the PFC level above $3.00 at a medium or large hub airport;

(7) A signed statement certifying that the public agency has met the requiements of § 158.19, if applicable, for any amendment proposing to increase the PFC level above $3.00 at a medium or large hub airport; and

(8) Any other information the Administrator may require.

(c) The Administrator will approve, partially approve or disapprove the amendment request and notify the public agency of the decision within 30 days of receipt of the request. If a PFC level of more than $3.00 is approved, the Administrator must find the project meets the requirements of §§ 158.17 and 158.19, if applicable, before the public agency can implement the new PFC level.

(d) The public agency must notify the carriers of any change to the FAA's decision with respect to an approved PFC resulting from an amendment. The effective date of any new PFC level must be no earlier than the first day of a month which is at least 30 days from the date the public agency notifies the carriers.
