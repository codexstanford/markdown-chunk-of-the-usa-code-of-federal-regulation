(g) If the responsible Flight Standards office finds that an emergency exists requiring immediate action with respect to safety in air commerce or air transportation that makes the procedures set out in this section impracticable or contrary to the public interest, that office may make the amendment, suspension or termination effective on the day the foreign air carrier or foreign person receives notice of it. In the notice to the foreign air carrier or foreign person, the responsible Flight Standards office will articulate the reasons for its finding that an emergency exists requiring immediate action with respect to safety in air transportation or air commerce or that makes it impracticable or contrary to the public interest to stay the effectiveness of the amendment, suspension or termination.
