###### § 380.66 Cancellation or conditioning of the registration.

The registration of a foreign charter operator may be canceled or subjected to additional terms, conditions, or limitations if any of the following occur:

(a) The operator files a written notice with the Department that it is discontinuing its charter operations;

(b) A substantial ownership interest is acquired by persons who are not citizens of the same country as the registrant; or

(c) The Department finds, after notice and an opportunity for responses, that it is in the public interest to do so. In making this finding, the Department will consider whether effective reciprocity exists between the United States and the government of the foreign charter operator.
