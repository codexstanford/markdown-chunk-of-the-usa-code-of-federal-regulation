### PART 1266 - CROSS-WAIVER OF LIABILITY
#### § 1266.101 Scope.

The provisions at § 1266.102 are intended to implement the cross-waiver requirement in Article 16 of the intergovernmental agreement entitled, "Agreement Among the Government of Canada, Governments of Member States of the European Space Agency, the Government of Japan, the Government of the Russian Federation, and the Government of the United States of America concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station (IGA)." Article 16 establishes a cross-waiver of liability for use by the Partner States and their related entities and requires that this reciprocal waiver of claims be extended to contractually or otherwise-related entities of NASA by requiring those entities to make similar waivers of liability. Thus, NASA is required to include IGA-based cross-waivers in agreements for ISS activities that fall within the scope of "Protected Space Operations," as defined in § 1266.102. The provisions of § 1266.102 provide the regulatory basis for cross-waiver clauses to be incorporated into NASA agreements for activities that implement the IGA and the memoranda of understanding between the United States and its respective international partners. The provisions of § 1266.104 provide the regulatory basis for cross-waiver clauses to be incorporated into NASA launch agreements for science or space exploration activities unrelated to the ISS.
