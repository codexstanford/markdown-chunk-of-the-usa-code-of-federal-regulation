(2) Utilize the abilities and talents of the universities of the Nation to support and contribute to the exploration and development of the resources and opportunities afforded by the space environment;

(3) Encourage and support the existence of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary programs of space research to engage in activities of training (including teacher education), research, and public service and to have cooperative programs with industry;

(4) Encourage and support the existence of consortia, composed of university and industry members, to advance the exploration and development of space resources in cases in which national objectives can be better fulfilled than through the programs of single universities;

(5) Encourage and support Federal funding for graduate fellowships in fields related to space;

(6) Support activities in colleges and universities generally for the purpose of creating and operating a network of institutional programs that will enhance achievements resulting from efforts under this Act; and

(7) Encourage cooperation and coordination among Federal agencies and Federal programs concerned with space issues.
