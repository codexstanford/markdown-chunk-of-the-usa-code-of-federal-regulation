(2) A proposed procedure for operating the facility.

(3) A proposed maintenance organization and a maintenance manual that meets the requirements of § 171.51.

(4) A statement of intent to meet the requirements of this subpart.

(5) A showing that the facility has an acceptable level of operational reliability and an acceptable standard of performance.

The owner must then correct the deficiencies, if any, and operate the facility for an in-service evaluation by the FAA.
