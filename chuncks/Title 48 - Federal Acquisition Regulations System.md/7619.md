DoD has established the National Defense Projects Rating Plan, also known as the Special Casualty Insurance Rating Plan, as a risk-pooling arrangement to minimize the cost to the Government of purchasing the liability insurance listed in FAR 28.307-2. Use the plan in accordance with the procedures at PGI 228.304 when it provides the necessary coverage more advantageously than commercially available coverage.
