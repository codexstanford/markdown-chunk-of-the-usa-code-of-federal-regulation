###### 25.406 Israeli Trade Act.

Acquisitions of supplies by most agencies are covered by the Israeli Trade Act, if the estimated value of the acquisition is $50,000 or more but does not exceed the WTO GPA threshold for supplies (see 25.402(b)). Agencies other than the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior, the Federal Housing Finance Board, and the Office of Thrift Supervision must evaluate offers of Israeli end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American statute. The Israeli Trade Act does not prohibit the purchase of other foreign end products. In accordance with Section 201 (a)(3) of the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Implementation Act (Pub. L. 109-53), when the CAFTA-DR agreement enters into force with respect to a country, that country is no longer designated as a beneficiary country for purposes of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, and is therefore no longer included in the definition of "Caribbean Basin country" for purposes of the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative.
