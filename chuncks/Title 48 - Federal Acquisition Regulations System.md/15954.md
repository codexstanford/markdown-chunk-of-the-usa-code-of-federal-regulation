### PART 6106 - RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR ARBITRATION OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY OR REPAYMENT
#### 6106.608 Evidence; timing [Rule 608].
##### i.e.,

No party is required to provide additional evidence. An applicant or grantee may, but need not, supplement materials it previously provided to FEMA regarding the dispute. A party may elect to present additional evidence,documents, things, or testimony tending to make a factual contention appear more or less likely to be true. If a party so elects, the panel will to the extent practicable allow a response. FEMA shall efile its response to an arbitration request within 30 calendar days after receiving the docketing notice. A panel may not exclude as untimely evidence proffered before arbitration closes under Rule 613. A panel may consider the timing or surprise nature of evidence when assessing the significance, credibility, or probative value of the evidence.
