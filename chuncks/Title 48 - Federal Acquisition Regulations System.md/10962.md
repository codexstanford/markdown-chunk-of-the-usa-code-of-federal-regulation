###### 819.7010 Tiered set-aside evaluation.

(a) Pursuant to the authority of 38 U.S.C. 8127 and under limited circumstances as set forth in this section, contracting officers may consider using a tiered set-aside evaluation approach to minimize delays in the re-solicitation process.

(b) Tiered evaluation of offers is a procedure that may be used in competitive negotiated acquisitions, including construction and acquisitions for commercial products and commercial services when the VA Rule of Two (see 802.101) determination indicates a set-aside is required, but other circumstances preclude a confident conclusion that an award can be made at the SDVOSB or VOSB tier. The contracting officer-

(1) Solicits and receives offers from targeted tiers of small business groups, with SDVOSB as the first tier and VOSB as the second tier;

(2) Establishes a tiered order of priority for evaluating offers that is specified in the solicitation; and

(3) If no award can be made at the first tier, evaluates offers at the next lower tier, until award can be made.

(c) Market research, which shall be conducted and documented in advance of issuing the solicitation, will inform which of the following types of tiers will be included in the solicitation:

(1) Tiered evaluations limited to SDVOSBs or VOSBs;

(2) Tiered evaluations including 8(a) and HUBZone small businesses; or

(3) Tiered evaluations including all other small business concerns.

(d) The tiered order of priority shall be consistent with 819.7005. Consideration shall be given to HUBZone and 8(a) small business concerns before evaluating offers from other small business concerns.
