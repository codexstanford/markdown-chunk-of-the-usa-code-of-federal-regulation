It is DOJ's goal to resolve contract disputes before the issuance of a contracting officer's final decision under the Contract Disputes Act. Therefore, contracting officers will consider all possible means of reaching a negotiated settlement consistent with the Government's best interest, before issuing a final decision on a contractor claim under the process outlined in FAR 33.206 through 33.211.
