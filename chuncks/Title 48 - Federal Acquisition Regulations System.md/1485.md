###### 13.305-4 Procedures.

(a) Each purchase using imprest funds or third party drafts shall be based upon an authorized purchase requisition, contracting officer verification statement, or other agency approved method of ensuring that adequate funds are available for the purchase.

(b) Normally, purchases should be placed orally and without soliciting competition if prices are considered reasonable.

(c) Since there is, for all practical purposes, simultaneous placement of the order and delivery of the items, clauses are not required for purchases using imprest funds or third party drafts.

(d) Forms prescribed at 13.307(e) may be used if a written order is considered necessary (e.g., if required by the supplier for discount, tax exemption, or other reasons). If a purchase order is used, endorse it "Payment to be made from Imprest Fund" (or "Payment to be made from Third Party Draft," as appropriate).

(e) The individual authorized to make purchases using imprest funds or third party drafts shall-

(1) Furnish to the imprest fund or third party draft cashier a copy of the document required under paragraph (a) of this subsection annotated to reflect-

(i) That an imprest fund or third party draft purchase has been made;

(ii) The unit prices and extensions; and

(iii) The supplier's name and address; and

(2) Require the supplier to include with delivery of the supplies an invoice, packing slip, or other sales instrument giving-

(i) The supplier's name and address;

(ii) List and quantity of items supplied;

(iii) Unit prices and extensions; and

(iv) Cash discount, if any.
