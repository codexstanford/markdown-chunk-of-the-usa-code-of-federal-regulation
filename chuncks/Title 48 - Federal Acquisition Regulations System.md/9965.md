#### PART 570 - ACQUIRING LEASEHOLD INTERESTS IN REAL PROPERTY
##### Subpart 570.7 - Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses
###### 570.704 Deviations to provisions and clauses.

(a) The contracting officer needs a deviation approved under Subpart 501.4 to omit any required provision or clause.

(b) The contracting officer also needs an approved deviation to modify the language of a provision or clause mandated by statute (e.g., FAR 52.215-2, Audit and Records-Negotiation). The authorizing statute must allow for a waiver.

(c) Certain clauses required by non-GSA regulations require approval of the issuing agency before the contracting officer can delete or modify them. For example, FARs 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era; and 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, require the approval of the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs before they can be deleted from or modified in the SFO or lease.
