(a) Existing works include motion pictures, television recordings, video recordings, and other audiovisual works in any medium; sound recordings in any medium; musical, dramatic, and literary works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; and works of a similar nature. Usually, these or similar works were not first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract. Therefore, the Government must obtain a license in the work if it intends to reproduce the work, distribute copies of the work, prepare derivative works, or perform or display the work publicly. When the Government is not responsible for the content of an existing work, it should require the copyright owner to indemnify the Government for liabilities that may arise out of the content, performance, use, or disclosure of such data.

(b) Follow the procedures at 227.7106 for works which will be first created, developed, generated, originated, prepared, or produced under a Government contract and the Government needs to control distribution of the work or has a specific need to obtain indemnity for liabilities that may arise out of the creation, content, performance, use, or disclosure of the work or from libelous or other unlawful material contained in the work. Follow the procedures at 227.7103 when the Government does not need to control distribution of such works or obtain such indemnities.
