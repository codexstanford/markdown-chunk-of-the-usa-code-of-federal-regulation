###### 4.1007 Solicitation alternative line item proposal.

Solicitations should be structured to allow offerors to propose alternative line items (see 4.1008 and 52.212-1(e)). For example, when soliciting certain items using units of measure such as kit, set, or lot, the offeror may not be able to group and deliver all items in a single shipment.
