###### 46.307 Fixed-price research and development contracts.

(a) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 52.246-7, Inspection of Research and Development-Fixed-Price, in solicitations and contracts for research and development when (1) the primary objective of the contract is the delivery of end items other than designs, drawings, or reports, (2) a fixed-price contract is contemplated, and (3) the contract amount is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold; unless use of the clause is impractical and the clause prescribed in 46.309 is considered to be more appropriate.

(b) The contracting officer may insert the clause in such solicitations and contracts when the contract amount is expected to be at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, and its use is in the Government's interest.
