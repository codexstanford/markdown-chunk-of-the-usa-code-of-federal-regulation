(i) Small business contractors; and

(ii) Prime contractors that subcontract with a small business concern, if the prime contractor agrees to make payments to the small business subcontractor within 15 days of receiving the accelerated payment from the Government, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor, to the maximum extent practicable, without any further consideration from or fees charged to the subcontractor.

(2) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3801(b), DoD shall provide accelerated payments, to the fullest extent permitted by law, with a goal of 15 days after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation, to-

(b) This acceleration does not provide any new rights under the Prompt Payment Act and does not affect the application of the Prompt Payment Act late payment interest provisions.

(c) Agencies may use the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment (see 32.1108) to facilitate accelerated payment, to earn refunds, and to reduce invoice processing costs.
