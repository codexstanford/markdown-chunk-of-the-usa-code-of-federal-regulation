###### 1903.670 Contracts between the Broadcasting Board of Governors and former employees.

To avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of preferential treatment, purchase orders, contracts, grants or cooperative agreements with former employees of the Broadcasting Board of Governors, or with firms in which former employees or their family members are known to have controlling interest, may be entered into within two years following separation from employment only with the written approval of the Board Director. A written justification shall be made a part of the file. The justification must address the issue of conflict of interest and conclude that it does not exist; or that in spite of its existence, the Board's ability to meet its mission would be seriously harmed without the award.
