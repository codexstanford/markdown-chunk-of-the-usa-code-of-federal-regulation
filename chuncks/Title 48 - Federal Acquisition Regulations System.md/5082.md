(c) The decision reached and the actual cost or estimated potential cost involved, if any;

(d) A statement of the circumstances justifying the decision;

(e) Identification of any of the foregoing information classified "Confidential" or higher (instead of being included in the memorandum, such information may be set forth in a separate classified document referenced in the memorandum); and
