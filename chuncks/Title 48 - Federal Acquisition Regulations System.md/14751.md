(2) The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as provided at 2452.232-70, Payment Schedule and Invoice Submission (Fixed-price), in fixed-price contracts other than performance-based contracts under which performance-based payments will be used.

(3) The contracting officer shall insert a clause substantially the same as provided at 2452.232-71, Voucher Submission, in all cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, and labor-hour type solicitations and contracts.
