###### 819.7008 Sole source awards to verified service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.

(a) A contracting officer may award a contract to a VIP-listed service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) using other than competitive procedures provided-

(1) The anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will not exceed $5 million;

(2) The requirement is synopsized and the required justification pursuant to FAR 6.302-5(c)(2)(ii) is posted in accordance with FAR part 5;

(3) The SDVOSB has been determined to be a responsible contractor with respect to performance; and

(4) In the estimation of the contracting officer contract award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the Government.

(b) The contracting officer's determination to make a sole source award is a business decision wholly within the discretion of the contracting officer.

(c) A determination that only one SDVOSB can meet the requirement is not required. However, in accordance with FAR 6.302-5(c)(2)(ii), contracts awarded using this authority shall be supported by a written justification and approval described in FAR 6.303 and 6.304, as applicable.

(d) When conducting a SDVOSB sole source acquisition, the contracting officer shall ensure the business meets eligibility requirements in 819.7003.

(e) A procurement requirement estimated to exceed the legislative threshold of $5 million shall not be split or subdivided to permit the use of this SDVOSB sole source authority.
