(1) The property administrator shall increase surveillance to prevent, to the extent possible, any loss, damage, or destruction of Government property; and

(2) Advise the contracting officer of any known or reported incidence of loss, damage or destruction identified during any period in which the contracting officer has revoked the Government's acceptance of risk.
