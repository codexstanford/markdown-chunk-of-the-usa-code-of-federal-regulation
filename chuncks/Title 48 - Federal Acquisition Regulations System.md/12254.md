###### 1213.7000 Applicability.

(a) DOT policy at 1237.7000 applies to Standard Form (SF) 182, Request, Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training, which may be used to acquire training services; however, the policy does not apply to training services acquired by Governmentwide commercial purchase card. The Governmentwide commercial purchase card may only be used to acquire training services valued at the micro-purchase threshold level or less.

(b) As reflected in 1237.7002, this policy does not apply to training attended by DOT employees that is scheduled and conducted by Government sources of supply, educational institutions, or private entities where DOT does not control or sponsor the training. Examples of when the policy does and does not apply include:

(1) When SF 182s are issued for three DOT employees to attend a one-week course at a university or other private entity, the policy does not apply. DOT does not control the course because the university or private entity has a contract in place with the training provider and DOT is placing an order under an existing contract; and

(2) When DOT awards a contract to a university or other private entity to provide training for DOT and/or other Government personnel, the policy applies. DOT controls this course; therefore, no soliciting or advertising of private non-Government training while conducting the contracted-for training is permitted.
