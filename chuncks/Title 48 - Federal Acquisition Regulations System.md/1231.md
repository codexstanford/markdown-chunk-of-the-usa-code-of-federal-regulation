(2) The detailed technical requirements for the tests that must be performed for approval; and

(3) The necessary data that must be submitted to the Government in the first article approval test report;

(b) Provide, in the circumstance where the Government is to be responsible for the first article approval testing-

(1) The performance or other characteristics that the first article must meet for approval; and

(2) The tests to which the first article will be subjected for approval;

(c) Inform offerors that the requirement may be waived when supplies identical or similar to those called for have previously been delivered by the offeror and accepted by the Government (see 52.209-3(h) and 52.209- 4(i));

(d) Permit the submission of alternative offers, one including testing and approval and the other excluding testing and approval (if eligible under paragraph (c) of this section);

In the latter case, any resulting difference in delivery schedules shall not be a factor in evaluation for award. The clause at 52.209-4, First Article Approval-Government Testing, shall contain the delivery schedule for the first article;

(g) Provide for the submission of contract numbers, if any, to document the offeror's eligibility under paragraph (c) of this section;

(i) Include, when the Government is responsible for first article testing, the Government's estimated testing costs as a factor for use in evaluating offers (when appropriate); and
