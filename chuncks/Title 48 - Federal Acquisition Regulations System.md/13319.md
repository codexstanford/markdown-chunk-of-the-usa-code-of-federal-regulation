(c) The CO may ask the appropriate Regional Solicitor to review the enterprise's representation.

(d) The CO may also request the Office of the Inspector General (on Form DI-1902 as part of a normal pre-award audit) to assist in determining the eligibility of the low responsive and responsible offerors on Buy Indian Act awards.

(e) The IEE representation does not relieve the CO of the obligation for determining contractor responsibility, as required by FAR subpart 9.1.
