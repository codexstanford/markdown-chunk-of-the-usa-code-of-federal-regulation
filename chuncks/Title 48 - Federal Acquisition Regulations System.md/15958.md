### PART 6106 - RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR ARBITRATION OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY OR REPAYMENT
#### 6106.612 Streamlined procedures [Rule 612].

The Board encourages parties to focus on providing only the information a panel needs to resolve an eligibility or repayment dispute. Examples of streamlining may include without limitation-

(a) Electing not to supplement the materials already provided to FEMA, if (or to the extent) the existing record adequately frames the dispute;

(b) Relying when possible on documents over other types of evidence;

(c) Simplifying live hearings by efiling in advance written testimony, reports, or opening statements by some witnesses or party representatives;

(d) Refraining from objecting to evidence without good cause; and

(e) Omitting duplicative and immaterial evidence and arguments.
