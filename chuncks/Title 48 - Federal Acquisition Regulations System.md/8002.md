The individuals authorized in 239.7303 may exercise the authority provided in 239.7305 only after-

(b) Making a determination in writing, in unclassified or classified form, with the concurrence of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, that-

(1) Use of the authority in 239.7305(a), (b), or (c) is necessary to protect national security by reducing supply chain risk;

(2) Less intrusive measures are not reasonably available to reduce such supply chain risk; and

(3) In a case where the individual authorized in 239.7303 plans to limit disclosure of information under 239.7305(d), the risk to national security due to the disclosure of such information outweighs the risk due to not disclosing such information; and
