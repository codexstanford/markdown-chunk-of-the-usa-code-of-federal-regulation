###### 27.202-5 Solicitation provisions and contract clause.

(a)(1) Insert a solicitation provision substantially the same as the provision at 52.227-6, Royalty Information, in-

(i) Any solicitation that may result in a negotiated contract for which royalty information is desired and for which certified cost or pricing data are obtained under 15.403; or

(ii) Sealed bid solicitations only if the need for such information is approved at a level above the contracting officer as being necessary for proper protection of the Government's interests.

(2) If the solicitation is for communication services and facilities by a common carrier, use the provision with its Alternate I.

(b) If the Government is obligated to pay a royalty on a patent involved in the prospective contract, insert in the solicitation a provision substantially the same as the provision at 52.227-7, Patents-Notice of Government Licensee. If the clause at 52.227-6 is not included in the solicitation, the contracting officer may require offerors to provide information sufficient to provide this notice to the other offerors.

(c) Insert the clause at 52.227-9, Refund of Royalties, in negotiated fixed-price solicitations and contracts when royalties may be paid under the contract. If a fixed-price incentive contract is contemplated, change "price" to "target cost and target profit" wherever it appears in the clause. The clause may be used in cost-reimbursement contracts where agency approval of royalties is necessary to protect the Government's interests.
