If taxes or customs duties nevertheless are imposed, the foreign government must reimburse the amount of such taxes to the U.S. Government (Section 579 of Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2003 (Pub. L. 108-7), as amended by Section 506 of Division D of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004 (Pub. L. 108-199), and similar sections in subsequent acts).

(b) This foreign tax exemption-

(1) Applies to a contract or subcontract for commodities when-

(i) The funds are appropriated by the annual foreign operations appropriations act; and

(ii) The value of the contract or subcontract is $500 or more;

(2) Does not apply to the acquisition of services;

(3) Generally is implemented through letters of offer and acceptance, other country-to-country agreements, or Federal interagency agreements; and
