(a) The head of the contracting activity (HCA) (non-delegable) may, with the written concurrence of the Suspension and Debarment Official, make the determinations referenced in FAR 9.405(a) regarding contracts.

(1) If a contracting officer considers it necessary to award a contract, or consent to a subcontract with a debarred or suspended contractor, the contracting officer shall prepare a determination, including all pertinent documentation, and submit it through appropriate acquisition channels to the HCA. The documentation shall include the date by which approval is required and a compelling reason for the proposed action. Compelling reasons for award of a contract or consent to a subcontract with a debarred or suspended contractor include the following:

(i) Only the cited contractor can provide the property or services, and

(ii) The urgency of the requirement dictates that HHS conduct business with the cited contractor.

(2) If the HCA decides to approve the requested action, the HCA shall request the concurrence of the Suspension and Debarment Official and, if given, shall inform the contracting officer in writing of the determination within the required time period.
