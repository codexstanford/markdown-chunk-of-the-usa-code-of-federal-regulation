(1) The notice would disclose the occupant agency's needs and the disclosure of such needs would compromise the national security; or

(2) The lease-

(i) Is for an amount not greater than the simplified lease acquisition threshold;

(ii) Was made through a means where access to the notice of proposed lease action was provided through the GPE; and

(iii) Permitted the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
