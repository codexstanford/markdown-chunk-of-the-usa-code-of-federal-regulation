###### 217.7403 Policy.

DoD policy is that undefinitized contract actions shall-

(a) Be used only when-

(1) The negotiation of a definitive contract action is not possible in sufficient time to meet the Government's requirements; and

(2) The Government's interest demands that the contractor be given a binding commitment so that contract performance can begin immediately.

(b) Be as complete and definite as practicable under the particular circumstances.
