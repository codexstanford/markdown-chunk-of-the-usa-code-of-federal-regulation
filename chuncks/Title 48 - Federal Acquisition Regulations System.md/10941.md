###### 819.203-70 Priority for SDVOSB/VOSB contracting preferences.

(a) 38 U.S.C. 8127 and 8128 require the VA to provide priority and establish special acquisition methods to increase contracting opportunities for SDVOSBs/VOSBs. These priorities and special acquisition methods are set forth in subpart 819.70 and shall be applied by contracting officers before other priorities and preferences in FAR 19.203.

(b) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 8128, contracting officers shall give priority to SDVOSBs/VOSBs if such business concern(s) also meet the requirements of that contracting preference. The requirement in this paragraph (b) applies even when using a contracting preference under FAR part 19 (for example, a women-owned small business set-aside).
