(a) The review shall focus on both compliance with statutory/regulatory requirements as well as good contracting practices. Reviews shall be included in the official contract file along with documentation regarding the actions taken in response to the review.

(b) Reviews should be limited in time to prevent unnecessary procurement lead-time, but thorough in scope, considering all documents in the contract file and all relevant contracting issues. Checklists may be used to facilitate a thorough review, as appropriate.
