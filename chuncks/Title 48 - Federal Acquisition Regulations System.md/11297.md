(a) Without regard to FAR 15.304, Evaluation factors and significant subfactors (except for 15.304(c)(1) and (c)(3), which do apply to acquisitions under this authority), the criteria, factors, or other evaluation information that apply to an acquisition, and their relative importance, are within the broad discretion of agency acquisition officials as long as the evaluation information is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

(b) Price or cost to the Government must be evaluated in every source selection. Past performance shall be evaluated in source selections for competitive acquisitions exceeding the SAT unless the contracting officer documents that past performance is not an appropriate evaluation factor for the acquisition. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

(c) The quality of the product or service may be addressed in source selection through consideration of information such as past compliance with solicitation requirements, technical excellence, management capability, personnel qualifications, and prior experience. The information required from quoters, bidders, or offerors shall be included in notices or solicitations, as appropriate. (38 U.S.C. 8153)

(d) The relative importance of any evaluation information included in a solicitation must be set forth therein. (38 U.S.C. 8153)
