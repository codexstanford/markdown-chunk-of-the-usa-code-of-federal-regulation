### PART 6105 - DECISIONS AUTHORIZED UNDER 31 U.S.C. 3529
#### 6105.501 Scope [Rule 501].

These procedures govern the Board's issuance of decisions, upon the request of an agency disbursing or certifying official, or agency head, on questions involving payment of travel or relocation expenses that were formerly issued by the Comptroller General under 31 U.S.C. 3529. Section 204 of the General Accounting Office Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-316, transfers the authority to issue these decisions to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and authorizes the Director to delegate the authority to perform that function to another agency or agencies. The Director has delegated the authority to issue these decisions to the Administrator of General Services, who has redelegated that function to the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals.
