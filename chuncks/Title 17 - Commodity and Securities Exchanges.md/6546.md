##### § 201.52 Answer to application.

(a) Within 30 days after service of an application, counsel representing the Office or Division of the Commission may file an answer to the application. Unless the Office or Division of the Commission counsel requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.

(b) If counsel for the Office or Division of the Commission and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.

(c) The answer shall explain any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of that position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, it shall include supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 201.55.
