(b) These rules do not apply to:

(1) Investigations, except where made specifically applicable by the Rules Relating to Investigations, part 203 of this chapter; or

(2) Actions taken by the duty officer pursuant to delegated authority under 17 CFR 200.43.

(3) Initiation of proceedings for SRO proposed rule changes under 17 CFR 201.700-701, except where made specifically applicable therein.
