#### Subpart Q - Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
##### § 249.1600b Form SBSE-BD, for application for registration as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant or to amend such an application for registration by firms registered or registering with the Commission as a broker or dealer.

This form shall be used instead of either Form SBSE (§ 249.1600) or SBSE-A (§ 249.1600a) to apply for registration as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant solely by firms registered or registering with the Commission as a broker or dealer, pursuant to Section 15F(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)) and to amend such an application for registration. An entity that is registered or registering with the Commission as a broker or dealer and is also registered or registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a swap dealer or major swap participant, shall apply for registration as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant on this Form SBSE-BD and not on Form SBSE-A.
