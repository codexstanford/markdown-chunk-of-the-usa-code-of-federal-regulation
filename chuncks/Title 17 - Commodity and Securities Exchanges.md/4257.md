(b) A complete application for registration must include:

(1) A completed Form FBOT and Form Supplement S-1, as set forth in the appendix to this part, or any successor forms, and all information and documentation described in such forms; and

(2) Any additional information and documentation necessary, in the discretion of the Commission, to supplement the application including, but not limited to, documentation and information provided during the course of an on-site visit, as applicable, to the foreign board of trade, the clearing organization and the regulatory authority or authorities, to effectively demonstrate that the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization satisfy the registration requirements set forth in § 48.7.

(c) An applicant for registration must identify with particularity any information in the application that will be subject to a request for confidential treatment and must provide support for any request for confidential treatment pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 145.9 of this chapter.

(d) If, upon review, the Commission finds the application for registration to be complete, the Commission may approve or deny the application. In reviewing the application, the Commission will consider, among other things:

(1) Whether the foreign board of trade is eligible to be registered as defined in § 48.2(b) and;

(2) Whether the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in their home country or countries that is comparable to the comprehensive supervision and regulation to which designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations are respectively subject under the Act, Commission regulations, and other applicable United States laws and regulations, if any, and;

(3) Any previous Commission findings that the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate government authorities in their home country or countries that is comparable to the comprehensive supervision and regulation to which designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations are subject under the Act, Commission regulations, and other applicable United States laws and regulations, if any; and

(4) Whether the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization have adequately demonstrated that they meet the requirements for registration specified in § 48.7.

(5) The Commission's determination that the foreign board of trade and its clearing organization are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate government authorities in their home country or countries that is comparable to the comprehensive supervision and regulation to which designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations are subject will be based upon a principles-based review conducted in a manner consistent with this part 48 pursuant to which the Commission will look to determine if the government authorities support and enforce regulatory objectives in the oversight of the foreign board of trade and the clearing organization that are substantially equivalent to the regulatory objectives supported and enforced by the Commission in its oversight of designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations.

(e) If the Commission approves the application, the Commission will issue an Order of Registration. If the Commission does not approve the application, the Commission will, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, issue a Notice of Action specifying that the application was not approved and setting forth the reasons therefor. The Commission, in its discretion, may impose conditions in the Order of Registration and may, after appropriate notice and an opportunity to respond, amend, suspend, or otherwise restrict the terms of an issued Order of Registration or issue an Order revoking registration.

(f) A foreign board of trade whose application is not approved may reapply for registration 360 days after the issuance of the Notice of Action if the foreign board of trade has addressed any deficiencies in its original application or facts and circumstances relevant to the Commission's review of the application have changed.
