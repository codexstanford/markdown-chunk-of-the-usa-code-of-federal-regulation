#### § 46.11 Reporting of errors and omissions in previously reported data.

(a) Each swap counterparty required by this part 46 to report data for a pre-enactment or a transition swap shall report any errors and omissions in the data so reported. Corrections of errors or omissions shall be reported as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of any such error or omission.

(b) Each counterparty to a pre-enactment or transition swap that is not the reporting counterparty as determined pursuant to § 46.5, and that discovers any error or omission with respect to any data for a pre-enactment or transition swap reported to a swap data repository for that swap, shall promptly notify the reporting counterparty of each such error or omission. As soon as technologically practicable after receiving such notice, the reporting counterparty shall report a correction of each such error or omission to the swap data repository.

(c) Each swap counterparty reporting corrections to errors or omissions in data previously reported as required by this part shall report such corrections in the same format as it reported the erroneous or omitted data.
