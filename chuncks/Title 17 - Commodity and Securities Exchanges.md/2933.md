##### § 37.1306 Reporting to the Commission.

(a) Each fiscal quarter, or at any time upon Commission request, a swap execution facility shall provide a report to the Commission that includes:

(1) The amount of financial resources necessary to meet the requirements of §§ 37.1301 and 37.1303, computed in accordance with the requirements of § 37.1304, and the market value of each available financial resource, computed in accordance with the requirements of § 37.1305; and

(2) Financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows of the swap execution facility.

(i) The financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, prepared in English, and denominated in U.S. dollars.

(ii) The financial statements of a swap execution facility that is not domiciled in the United States, and is not otherwise required to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, may satisfy the requirement in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section if such financial statements are prepared in accordance with either International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or a comparable international standard as the Commission may otherwise accept in its discretion.

(b) The calculations required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be made as of the last business day of the swap execution facility's applicable fiscal quarter.

(c) With each report required under paragraph (a) of this section, the swap execution facility shall also provide the Commission with sufficient documentation explaining the methodology used to compute its financial requirements under §§ 37.1301 and 37.1303. Such documentation shall:

(1) Allow the Commission to reliably determine, without additional requests for information, that the swap execution facility has made reasonable calculations pursuant to § 37.1304; and

(2) Include, at a minimum:

(i) A total list of all expenses, without any exclusion;

(ii) All expenses and the corresponding amounts, if any, that the swap execution facility excluded or prorated when determining its operating costs, calculated on a rolling basis, required under §§ 37.1301 and 37.1303, and the basis for any determination to exclude or prorate any such expenses;

(iii) Documentation demonstrating the existence of any committed line of credit or similar facility relied upon for the purpose of meeting the requirements of § 37.1303 (e.g., copies of agreements establishing or amending a credit facility or similar facility); and

(iv) All costs that a swap execution facility would incur to wind down the swap execution facility's operations, the projected amount of time for any such wind-down period, and the basis of its determination for the estimation of its costs and timing.

(d) The reports and supporting documentation required by this section shall be filed not later than 40 calendar days after the end of the swap execution facility's first three fiscal quarters, and not later than 90 calendar days after the end of the swap execution facility's fourth fiscal quarter, or at such later time as the Commission may permit, in its discretion, upon request by the swap execution facility.

(e) A swap execution facility shall provide notice to the Commission no later than 48 hours after it knows or reasonably should know that it no longer meets its obligations under § 37.1301 or 37.1303.
