#### Subpart Q - Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
##### § 249.1600a Form SBSE-A, for application for registration as a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant or to amend such an application for registration by firms registered or registering with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a swap dealer or major swap participant that are not also registered or registering with the Commission as a broker or dealer.
