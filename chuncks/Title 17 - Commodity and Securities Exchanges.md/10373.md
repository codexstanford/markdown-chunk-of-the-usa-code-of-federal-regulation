(3) Has engaged a transfer agent registered pursuant to Section 17A(c) of the Act to perform the function of a transfer agent with respect to such securities.

(b) An issuer that would be required to register a class of securities under Section 12(g) of the Act as a result of exceeding the asset threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may continue to exclude the relevant securities from the definition of "held of record" for a transition period ending on the penultimate day of the fiscal year two years after the date it became ineligible. The transition period terminates immediately upon the failure of an issuer to timely file any periodic report due pursuant to § 227.202 at which time the issuer must file a registration statement that registers that class of securities under the Act within 120 days.
