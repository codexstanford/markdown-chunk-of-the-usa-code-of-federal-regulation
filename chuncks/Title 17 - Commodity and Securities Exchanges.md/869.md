(a) The address of each registrant, applicant for registration, and principal, as submitted on the application for registration (Form 7-R or Form 8-R) or as submitted on the biographical supplement (Form 8-R) shall be deemed to be the address for delivery to the registrant, applicant or principal for any communications from the Commission or the National Futures Association, including any summons, complaint, reparation claim, order, subpoena, special call, request for information, notice, and other written documents or correspondence, unless the registrant, applicant or principal specifies another address for this purpose: Provided that the Commission or the National Futures Association may address any correspondence relating to a biographical supplement submitted for or on behalf of a principal to the futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, swap dealer, major swap participant, introducing broker, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, floor trader that is a non-natural person, or leverage transaction merchant with which the principal is affiliated and may address any correspondence relating to an associated person to the futures commission merchant, retail foreign exchange dealer, swap dealer, major swap participant, introducing broker, commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, floor trader that is a non-natural person, or leverage transaction merchant with which the associated person or the applicant for registration is or will be associated as an associated person.

(b) Each registrant, while registered and for two years after termination of registration, and each principal, while affiliated and for two years after termination of affiliation, must notify in writing the National Futures Association of any change of the address on the application for registration, biographical supplement, or other address filed with the National Futures Association for the purpose of receiving communications from the Commission or the National Futures Association. Failure to file a required response to any communication sent to the latest such address filed with the National Futures Association that is caused by a failure to notify in writing the National Futures Association of an address change may result in an order of default and award of claimed monetary damages or other appropriate order in any National Futures Association or Commission proceeding, including a reparation proceeding brought under part 12 of this chapter.
