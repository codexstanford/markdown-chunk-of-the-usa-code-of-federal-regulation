##### § 260.7a-27 Title of securities.

Where the title of securities is required to be furnished in an application, statement or report, the following requirements shall be met:

(a) In the case of shares, there shall be given the full designation of the class of shares and, if not included therein, the par or stated value, if any, and the rate of dividends, if fixed, and whether cumulative or non-cumulative.

(b) In the case of funded debt, there shall be given the full designation of the issue and, if not included therein, the rate of interest and the date of maturity. If the issue matures serially, a brief indication shall be given of the serial maturities: For example, "maturing serially from 1950 to 1960". If the payment of interest or principal is contingent, such contingency shall be appropriately indicated. The rate of interest, however, may be omitted from the title of indenture securities on the facing page of Form T-1 and Form T-2, if the rate of interest is not determined at the time these forms are filed.

(c) In the case of other securities, a similar designation shall be given.
