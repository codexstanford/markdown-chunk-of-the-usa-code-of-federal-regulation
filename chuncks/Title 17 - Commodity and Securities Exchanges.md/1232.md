### PART 4 - COMMODITY POOL OPERATORS AND COMMODITY TRADING ADVISORS
#### Subpart D - Advertising
##### § 4.41 Advertising by commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, and the principals thereof.

(a) No commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, or any principal thereof, may advertise in a manner which:

(1) Employs any device, scheme or artifice to defraud any participant or client or prospective participant or client;

(2) Involves any transaction, practice or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any participant or client or any prospective participant or client; or

(3) Refers to any testimonial, unless the advertisement or sales literature providing the testimonial prominently discloses:

(i) That the testimonial may not be representative of the experience of other clients;

(ii) That the testimonial is no guarantee of future performance or success; and

(iii) If, more than a nominal sum is paid, the fact that it is a paid testimonial.

(b)(1) No person may present the performance of any simulated or hypothetical commodity interest account, transaction in a commodity interest or series of transactions in a commodity interest of a commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor, or any principal thereof, unless such performance is accompanied by one of the following:

(i) The following statement: "These results are based on simulated or hypothetical performance results that have certain inherent limitations. Unlike the results shown in an actual performance record, these results do not represent actual trading. Also, because these trades have not actually been executed, these results may have under-or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated or hypothetical trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to these being shown." ; or

(ii) A statement prescribed pursuant to rules promulgated by a registered futures association pursuant to section 17(j) of the Act.

(2) If the presentation of such simulated or hypothetical performance is other than oral, the prescribed statement must be prominently disclosed and in immediate proximity to the simulated or hypothetical performance being presented.

(c) The provisions of this section shall apply:

(1) To any publication, distribution or broadcast of any report, letter, circular, memorandum, publication, writing, advertisement or other literature or advice, whether by electronic media or otherwise, including information provided via internet or e-mail, the texts of standardized oral presentations and of radio, television, seminar or similar mass media presentations; and

(2) Regardless of whether the commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor is exempt from registration under the Act.
