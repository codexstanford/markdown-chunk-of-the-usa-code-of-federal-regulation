(b)(1) For purposes of this section,means a transfer agent that during any six consecutive months shall have received fewer than 500 items for transfer and fewer than 500 items for processing.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, an exempt transfer agent that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) shall be exempt from the provisions of §§ 240.17Ad-2 (a), (b), (c), (d) and (h), 240.17Ad-3 and 240.17Ad-6(a) (2) through (7) and (11).

(3) Within ten business days following the close of the sixth consecutive month described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an exempt transfer agent shall:

(i) If its appropriate regulatory agency is either the Commission or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, prepare and maintain in its possession a document certifying that the transfer agent qualifies as exempt under paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or

(ii) If its appropriate regulatory agency is either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, file with the appropriate regulatory agency a notice certifying that it qualifies as exempt under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(c) Within five business days following the close of each month, every exempt transfer agent shall calculate the number of items which it received during the preceding six months. Whenever any exempt transfer agent no longer qualifies as such under paragraph (b)(1), within ten business days after the end of such month: (1) It shall prepare and maintain in its possession a document so stating, if subject to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section; or (2) it shall file with its appropriate regulatory agency a notice to that effect, if subject to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. Thereafter, beginning with the first month following the month in which such document is required to be prepared or such notice is required to be filed, the registered transfer agent no longer shall be exempt under paragraph (b) of this section. Any registered transfer agent which has ceased to be an exempt transfer agent under this paragraph shall not qualify again for exemption until it has conducted its transfer agent operations pursuant to the foregoing sections for six consecutive months following the month in which it was required to prepare the document or prepare and file the notice specified in this paragraph.
