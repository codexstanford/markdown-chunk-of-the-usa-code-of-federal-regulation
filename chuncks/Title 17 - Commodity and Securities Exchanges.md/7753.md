#### Subpart E - Miscellaneous Provisions
##### § 227.502 Insignificant deviations from a term, condition or requirement of this part (Regulation Crowdfunding).

(a) A failure to comply with a term, condition, or requirement of this part will not result in the loss of the exemption from the requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77e) for any offer or sale to a particular individual or entity, if the issuer relying on the exemption shows:

(1) The failure to comply was insignificant with respect to the offering as a whole;

(2) The issuer made a good faith and reasonable attempt to comply with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of this part; and

(3) The issuer did not know of such failure where the failure to comply with a term, condition or requirement of this part was the result of the failure of the intermediary to comply with the requirements of section 4A(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d-1(a)) and the related rules, or such failure by the intermediary occurred solely in offerings other than the issuer's offering.

(b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not preclude the Commission from bringing an enforcement action seeking any appropriate relief for an issuer's failure to comply with all applicable terms, conditions and requirements of this part.
