(2) Comply with part 450 and with paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section with respect to all fully paid and excess margin government securities held for customers of the financial institution in its capacity as government securities broker or dealer, and government securities that are the subject of a repurchase agreement between the financial institution and certain counterparties as described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(b) A financial institution shall not be in violation of the possession or control requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section if, solely as the result of normal business operations, temporary lags occur between the time when a security is first required to be in the financial institution's possession or control and the time when it is actually placed in possession or control, provided that the financial institution takes timely steps in good faith to establish prompt possession or control. In the event that a financial institution has accepted funds from a customer for the purchase of securities and the financial institution does not initiate the purchase of the specified securities by the close of the next business day after receipt of such customer's funds, the financial institution shall immediately deposit or redeposit the funds in an account belonging to such customer and send the customer notice of such deposit or redeposit.

(c)(1) On each business day a financial institution shall determine the quantity and issue of such securities, if any, that are required to be but are not in the financial institution's possession or control. As appropriate to bring such securities into possession or control, the financial institution shall:

(i) Promptly obtain the release of any lien, charge, or other encumbrance against such securities;

(ii) Promptly obtain the return of any securities loaned;

(iii) Take prompt steps to obtain possession or control of securities failed to receive for more than 30 calendar days, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, for more than 60 calendar days; or

(iv) Take prompt steps to buy in securities as necessary to the extent any shortage of securities in possession or control cannot be resolved as required by any of the above procedures.

(2) The financial institution shall prepare and maintain a current and detailed description of the procedures and internal controls that it utilizes to comply with the possession or control requirements of this paragraph (c), which shall be made available upon request to its appropriate regulatory agency.

(3) Nothing stated in this section shall be construed as affecting the absolute right of a customer of a government securities broker or dealer, unless otherwise agreed in writing, in the normal course of business operations following demand made on the broker or dealer, to receive the physical delivery of certificates if the securities are issued in certificated form, or to direct a transfer of or otherwise to exercise control over any securities if they are:

(i) Fully-paid securities to which the customer is entitled;

(ii) Margin securities upon full payment by such customer to the broker or dealer of the customer's indebtedness to the broker or dealer; or

(iii) Excess margin securities not reasonably required to collateralize such customer's indebtedness to the broker or dealer.

(d)(1) A financial institution that retains custody of securities that are the subject of a repurchase agreement between the financial institution and a counterparty shall:

(i) Obtain the repurchase agreement in writing;

(ii) Confirm in writing the specific securities that are the subject of a repurchase transaction pursuant to such agreement at the end of the day of initiation of the transaction and at the end of any other day during which other securities are substituted if the substitution results in a change to issuer, maturity date, par amount or coupon rate specified in the previous confirmation;

(iii) Advise the counterparty in the repurchase agreement that the funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a repurchase transaction are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable;

(iv) If the counterparty agrees to grant the financial institution the right to substitute securities, include in the written repurchase agreement the provision by which the financial institution retains the right to substitute securities;

(v) If the counterparty agrees to grant the financial institution the right to substitute securities, include in the written repurchase agreement the following disclosure statement, which must be prominently displayed in the written repurchase agreement immediately preceding the provision governing the right to substitution:

(vi) Maintain possession or control of securities that are the subject of the agreement in accordance with § 450.4(a) of this chapter, except when exercising its right of substitution in accordance with the provisions of the agreement and paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.

(2)(i) A confirmation issued in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section shall specify the issuer, maturity date, coupon rate, par amount and market value of the security and shall further identify a CUSIP or mortgage-backed security pool number, as appropriate, except that a CUSIP or a pool number is not required on the confirmation if it is identified in internal records of the broker or dealer that designate the specific security of the counterparty. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), the market value of any security that is the subject of the repurchase transaction shall be the most recently available bid price plus accrued interest, obtained by any reasonable and consistent methodology.
