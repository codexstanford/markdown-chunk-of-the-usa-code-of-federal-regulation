(1) Consider and decide miscellaneous procedural motions that may be directed to the Commission pursuant to part 12 of these rules after the initial decision or other order disposing of the entire proceeding has been filed;

(2) Remand, with or without specific instructions, initial decisions or other orders disposing of the entire proceeding to the appropriate officer (Director of the Office of Proceedings, Administrative Judge, or Administrative Law Judge) in the following situations-

(i) Where a default order or award has been made pursuant to part 12 of these rules and a motion to vacate the default or an equivalent request has been made; or

(ii) Where, in their judgment, clarification or supplementation of an initial decision or other order disposing of the entire proceeding prior to Commission review is appropriate; and

(iii) Where, in their judgment, a ministerial act necessary to the proper conduct of the proceeding has not been performed;

(3) Deny applications for interlocutory review by the Commission of a ruling of an Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge in cases in which the Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge has not certified the ruling to the Commission in the manner prescribed by § 12.309, and the ruling does not concern the disqualification of, or a motion to disqualify, an Administrative Judge or Administrative Law Judge, or the suspension of, or failure to suspend, an attorney from participating in reparation proceedings;

(4) Dismiss any appeal from an initial decision or other disposition of the entire proceeding by an Administrative Law Judge (or Administrative Judge), in a proceeding where such appeal is not filed or perfected in accordance with § 12.401, and deny any application for interlocutory review if it is not filed in accordance with § 12.309;

(5) Strike any filing that does not meet the requirements of, or is not perfected in accordance with, these part 12 rules; and

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, in any case in which the General Counsel believes it appropriate, the General Counsel or their designee may submit the matter to the Commission for its consideration.

(c) Within seven (7) days after service of a ruling issued pursuant to this § 12.408, a party may file with the Commission a petition for reconsideration of the ruling. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, the filing of a petition for reconsideration shall not operate to stay the effective date of such ruling.
