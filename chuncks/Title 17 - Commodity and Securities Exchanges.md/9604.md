## Chapter II - Securities and Exchange Commission
### PART 239 - FORMS PRESCRIBED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
#### Subpart A - Forms for Registration Statements
##### § 239.31 Form F-1, registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 for securities of certain foreign private issuers.

(a) Form F-1 shall be used for registration under the Securities Act of 1933 ("Securities Act") of securities of all foreign private issuers, as defined in rule 405 (§ 230.405 of this chapter) for which no other form is authorized or prescribed. In addition, this form shall not be used for an offering of asset-backed securities, as defined in § 229.1101 of this chapter.

(b) If a registrant is a majority-owned subsidiary, which does not itself meet the conditions of these eligibility requirements, it shall nevertheless be deemed to have met such conditions if its parent meets the conditions and if the parent fully guarantees the securities being registered as to principal and interest. In such an instance the parent-guarantor is the issuer of a separate security consisting of the guarantee which must be concurrently registered but may be registered on the same registration statement as are the guaranteed securities. Both the parent-guarantor and the subsidiary shall each disclose the information required by this Form as if each were the only registrant except that if the subsidiary will not be eligible to file annual reports on the form described in § 249.229f (Form 20-F) of this chapter after the effective date of the registration statement, then it shall disclose the information specified in the form described in § 239.11 (Form S-1) of this chapter. The requirements of § 210.3-10 (Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X) of this chapter are applicable to financial statements for a subsidiary of a parent company that issues securities guaranteed by the parent company.
