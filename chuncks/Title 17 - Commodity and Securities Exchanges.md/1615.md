Based on the recommendations submitted pursuant to § 10.111, the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge, as applicable, shall establish in writing a procedure for identifying and notifying individual persons who may be entitled to restitution, receiving and evaluating claims, obtaining funds to be paid as restitution from the party and distributing such funds to qualified claimants. As necessary or appropriate, the Commission or the Administrative Law Judge may appoint any person, including an employee of the Commission, to administer, or assist in administering, such restitution procedure. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, all costs incurred in administering an order of restitution shall be paid from the restitution funds obtained from the party who was so sanctioned; provided, however, that if the administrator is a Commission employee, no fee shall be charged for his or her services or for services performed by any other Commission employee working under his or her direction.
