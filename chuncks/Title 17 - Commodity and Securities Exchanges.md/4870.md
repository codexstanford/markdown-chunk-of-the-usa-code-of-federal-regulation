(1) Any department or agency of the United States, including for this purpose an independent regulatory agency, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction;

(2) Any department or agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction; or

(3) Any foreign futures authority, as defined in section 1a(10) of the Act, or any department or agency of any foreign government or political subdivision thereof, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction, provided that the Commission official making the disclosure is satisfied that the information will not be disclosed except in connection with an adjudicatory action or proceeding brought under the laws of such foreign government or political subdivision to which such foreign government or political subdivision or any department or agency thereof, or foreign futures authority is a party.

(b) Any disclosure made pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall be made with the concurrence of the Director of the Division of Enforcement or in his or her absence a Deputy Director of the Division of Enforcement. Provided, however, that no such concurrence is necessary for the Director of the Division of Market Oversight or in his or her absence each Deputy Director of the Division or for the Director of the Market Surveillance Section to release information under paragraph (a)(1) of this section concerning current or on-going market transactions or operations.

(c) In furnishing information under this delegation pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the Commission official making the disclosure shall remind the department or agency involved that section 8(e) of the Act prohibits the disclosure by such department or agency of information that would separately disclose the business transactions or market positions of any person and trade secrets or names of customers except in an action or proceeding under the laws of the United States, the State, or a political subdivision thereof to which the department or the agency of either the state or political subdivision, the Commission, or the United States is a party.

(d) This delegation shall not affect any other delegation which the Commission has made or may make, which authorizes any other officer or employee of the Commission to furnish information to governmental bodies on the Commission's behalf.

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, in any case in which any employee delegated authority therein believes it appropriate the matter may be submitted to the Commission for its consideration. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission from exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (a) of this section.
