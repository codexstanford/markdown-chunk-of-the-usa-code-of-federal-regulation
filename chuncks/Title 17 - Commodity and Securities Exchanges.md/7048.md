### PART 202 - INFORMAL AND OTHER PROCEDURES
#### § 202.13 Informal procedure with respect to applications under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

(a) On any application subject to 17 CFR 270.0-5, other than an application eligible for and proceeding under expedited review as provided for by 17 CFR 270.0-5(d), (e), and (f), the Division should take action within 90 days of the initial filing and each of the first three amendments thereto, and within 60 days of any subsequent amendment. Such 90- or 60-day period will stop running upon any irregular closure of the Commission's Washington, DC office to the public for normal business, including, but not limited to, closure due to a lapse in Federal appropriations, national emergency, inclement weather, or ad hoc Federal holiday, and will resume upon the reopening of the Commission's Washington, DC office to the public for normal business. The Division may grant 60-day extensions and the applicant should be notified of any such extension.

(b) Action on the application or any amendment thereto shall consist of:

(1) Issuing a notice;

(2) Providing the applicant with requests for clarification or modification of the application; or

(3) Informing applicant that the application will be forwarded to the Commission, in which case the application is no longer subject to the provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The provisions of this section, including the timeframes provided for in this section, are not intended to create enforceable rights by any interested parties and shall not be deemed to do so. Rather, this section provides informal non-binding guidelines and procedures that the Commission anticipates the Division following.
