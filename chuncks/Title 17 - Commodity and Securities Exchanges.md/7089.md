(e) The employee's right to inspect and copy Commission records relating to the debt (if copies of such records are not attached), or if the employee or his or her representative cannot personally inspect the records, the right to request and receive a copy of such records.

(i) If a hearing is requested, the hearing official will issue a final decision, based on information presented to the hearing official, at the earliest practicable date, but no later than 60 days after the petition for the hearing is filed unless the employee requests and the hearing official, for good cause or in the interests of justice, deems it necessary to extend that time period (5 CFR 550.1104(d)(10));
