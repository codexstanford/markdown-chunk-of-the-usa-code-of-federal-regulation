Subject to § 22.3(d), each derivatives clearing organization and each Collecting Futures Commission Merchant receiving Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral from a futures commission merchant shall treat the value of collateral required with respect to the portfolio of rights and obligations arising out of the Cleared Swaps intermediated for each Cleared Swaps Customer, and collected from the futures commission merchant, as belonging to such Cleared Swaps Customer, and such amount shall not be used to margin, guarantee, or secure the Cleared Swaps or other obligations of the futures commission merchant, or of any other Cleared Swaps Customer, Futures Customer (as § 1.3 of this chapter defines that term), or Foreign Futures or Foreign Options Customer (as § 30.1 of this chapter defines that term). Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit, in any way, the right of a derivatives clearing organization or Collecting Futures Commission Merchant to liquidate any or all positions in a Cleared Swaps Customer Account in the event of a default of a clearing member or Depositing Futures Commission Merchant.
