(1) To waive or modify any of the requirements of §§ 171.25, 171.26, 171.27 and to waive or modify any requirement of the part 171 Rules insofar as it pertains to changes in the time permitted for filing, or the form, execution, service and filing of documents;

(3) To decline to accept any notice of appeal, or petition for stay pending review, of matters specified in § 171.1(b) and to so notify the appellant and the registered futures association;

(4) To stay the effective date of a decision of the National Futures Association in a disciplinary, membership denial or registration action, or a decision relating to such actions issued by the Commission pursuant to these rules, for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 10 days, when such a stay is necessary to allow the Commission to consider a petition to stay the effective date of such a decision or a motion for similar relief;

(5) To decline to accept any document which has not been filed or perfected as specified in these rules;

(6) To determine motions seeking permission to participate in a proceeding under § 171.27 and to establish the related briefing schedule;

(b) Within seven days after service of a ruling issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, a party may file with the Proceedings Clerk a petition for Commission reconsideration of the ruling. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, the filing of a petition for reconsideration will not operate to stay the effective date of such ruling.

(c) The General Counsel, or his designee, may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) Nothing in this section will be deemed to prohibit the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated to the General Counsel, or his designee, under this section.
