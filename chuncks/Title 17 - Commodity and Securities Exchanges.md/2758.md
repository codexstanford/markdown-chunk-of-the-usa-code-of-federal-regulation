### PART 31 - LEVERAGE TRANSACTIONS
#### § 31.29 Arbitration or other dispute settlement procedures.

Each self-regulatory organization which has members who are registered as leverage transaction merchants must be able to demonstrate its capability to promulgate rules and to conduct proceedings which provide a fair, equitable and expeditious procedure, through arbitration or otherwise, for the voluntary settlement of a leverage customer's claim or grievance brought against any member leverage transaction merchant or any employee of a member leverage transaction merchant.
