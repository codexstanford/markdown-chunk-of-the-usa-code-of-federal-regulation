(ii) Any amortization, sinking fund or retirement provisions, stating the annual amount, if any, which the EBRD will be under obligation to apply for the satisfaction of such provisions.

(e) If secured by any lien, the kind and priority thereof, and the nature of the property subject to the lien; if any other indebtedness is secured by an equal or prior lien on the same property, state the nature of such other liens.

(f) If any obligations issued or to be issued by the EBRD will, as to the payment of interest and principal, rank prior to the obligations to be distributed, describe the nature and extent of such priority, to the extent known.

(g) Outline briefly any provisions of the governing instruments under which the terms of the obligations to be distributed may be amended or modified by the holders thereof or otherwise.

The following information shall be given, in substantially the tabular form indicated, as to all primary obligations that are to be offered for cash (estimate, if necessary):
