##### § 200.59 Relationship with persons subject to regulation.

In all matters before him, a member should administer the law without regard to any personality involved, and with regard only to the issues. Members should not become indebted in any way to persons who are or may become subject to their jurisdiction. No member should accept loans, presents or favors of undue value from persons who are regulated or who represent those who are regulated. In performing their judicial functions, members should avoid discussion of a matter with any person outside this Commission and its staff while that matter is pending. In the performance of his rule-making and administrative functions, a member has a duty to solicit the views of interested persons. Care must be taken by a member in his relationship with persons within or outside of the Commission to separate the judicial and the rule-making functions and to observe the liberties of discussion respectively appropriate. Insofar as it is consistent with the dignity of his official position, he should maintain contact with the persons outside the agency who may be affected by his rule-making functions, but he should not accept unreasonable or lavish hospitality in so doing.
