Any registered investment company or business development company advertisement, pamphlet, circular, form letter, or other sales literature addressed to or intended for distribution to prospective investors in connection with a public offering (for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, "sales literature") will have omitted to state a fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not materially misleading unless the sales literature includes the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
