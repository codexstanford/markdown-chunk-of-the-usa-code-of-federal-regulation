A person associated, seeking to become associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct, associated or seeking to become associated with a municipal advisor, shall be subject to a Commission order that censures or places limitations on the activities or functions of such person, or suspends for a period not exceeding twelve months or bars such person from being associated with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or bar is in the public interest and that such person has committed any act, or is subject to an order or finding, enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), (H), or (G) of paragraph (4) of section 15(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78(b)(4)(A), 78(b)(4)(D), 78(b)(4)(E), 78(b)(4)(H), 78(b)(4)(G)), has been convicted of any offense specified in subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (4) (15 U.S.C. 78(b)(4)(B)) within 10 years of the commencement of the proceedings under section 15B(c)(4) (15 U.S.C. 78-4(c)(4)), or is enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph (C) of such paragraph (4) (15 U.S.C. 78(b)(4)(C)).
