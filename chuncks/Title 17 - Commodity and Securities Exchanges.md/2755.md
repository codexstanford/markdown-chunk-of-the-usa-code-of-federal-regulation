Each leverage transaction merchant must file, in accordance with the instructions of, and in the format specified by, the National Furtures Association a quarterly report with the National Futures Association by the fifteenth business day of the month following the quarter covered by the report. The report must list all leverage contracts which were either repurchased, resold, liquidated or settled by delivery by or to the leverage transaction merchant during the quarter and, with respect to each leverage contract, must include the following information:

(a) The leverage commodity and contract involved;

(b) Whether a long or short leverage contract was involved;

(c) The date the leverage contract was entered into;

(d) The maturity date of the leverage contract at initiation;

(e) The price at which the leverage contract was entered into;

(f) Whether the leverage contract was repurchased, resold, liquidated or settled by delivery;

(g) The date the leverage contract was repurchased, resold, liquidated or settled by delivery;

(h) The price at which the leverage contract was repurchased, resold or liquidated;

(i) The leverage customer account identification number;

(j) Whether the leverage customer had a commercial or noncommercial leverage account;

(k) Whether the leverage customer was the owner or holder of a proprietary leverage account as defined in § 31.4(e); and

(l) The profit or loss incurred by the leverage customer on the contract. In the case of a long leverage contract, profit or loss shall be determined by subtracting, from the total value of the contract based on the leverage transaction merchant's bid price at the time of repurchase or liquidation, the total value of the contract based on the ask price at which the contract was entered into, minus any amounts paid or owed by the leverage customer to the leverage transaction merchant, including initial, carrying and termination charges, plus any amounts paid or credited by the leverage transaction merchant to the leverage customer, in connection with the leverage contract. In the case of a short leverage contract, profit or loss shall be determined by subtracting, from the total value of the contract based on the bid price at which the contract was entered into, the total value of the contract based on the leverage transaction merchant's ask price at the time of resale or liquidation, minus any amounts paid or owed by the leverage customer to the leverage transaction merchant, including initial and termination charges, plus any amounts paid or credited by the leverage transaction merchant to the leverage customer, including carrying charges, in connection with the leverage contract.
