##### § 1.18 Records for and relating to financial reporting and monthly computation by futures commission merchants and introducing brokers.

(a) No person shall be registered as a futures commission merchant or as an introducing broker under the Act unless, commencing on the date his application for such registration is filed, he prepares and keeps current ledgers or other similar records which show or summarize, with appropriate references to supporting documents, each transaction affecting his asset, liability, income, expense and capital accounts, and in which (except as otherwise permitted in writing by the Commission) all his asset, liability and capital accounts are classified into either the account classification subdivisions specified on Form 1-FR-FCM or Form 1-FR-IB, respectively, or, if such person is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a securities broker or dealer and he files (in accordance with § 1.10(h)) a copy of his Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Part II, Part IIA, or Part II CSE (FOCUS report) in lieu of Form 1-FR-FCM or Form 1-FR-IB, the account classification subdivisions specified on such FOCUS report, or categories that are in accord with generally accepted accounting principles. Each person so registered shall prepare and keep current such records.

(b)(1) Each applicant or registrant must make and keep as a record in accordance with § 1.31 formal computations of its adjusted net capital and of its minimum financial requirements pursuant to § 1.17 or the requirements of the designated self-regulatory organization to which it is subject as of the close of business each month. Such computations must be completed and made available for inspection by any representative of the National Futures Association, in the case of an applicant, or of the Commission or designated self-regulatory organization, if any, in the case of a registrant, within 17 business days after the date for which the computations are made, commencing the first month end after the date the application for registration is filed.

(2) An applicant or registrant that has filed a monthly Form 1-FR or Statement of Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Part II, Part IIA, or Part II CSE (FOCUS report) in accordance with the requirements of § 1.10(b) will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section for such month.

(c) The provisions of this section do not apply to an introducing broker which is operating pursuant to a guarantee agreement, nor do such provisions apply to an applicant for registration as an introducing broker who files concurrently with such application a guarantee agreement, provided such introducing broker or applicant therefor is not also a securities broker or dealer.
