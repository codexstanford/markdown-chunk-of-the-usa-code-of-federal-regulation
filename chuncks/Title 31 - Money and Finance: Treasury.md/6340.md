##### PART 391 - WAIVER OF INTEREST, ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AND PENALTIES
###### § 391.2 Equitable considerations.

For reasons of equity and good conscience, late charges may be waived under the circumstances identified in this section.

(a) Where, without fault or bad faith, the debtor could not submit payment within 30 days of the interest accrual date, the mandatory waiver provision in 4 CFR 102.13(g) may be extended. Such waiver will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Examples include, but are not limited to:

(1) Postal service delays in forwarding the notice of indebtedness to a new address; and

(2) Late receipt of the notice of indebtedness where the debtor was away from home on an extended vacation or hospitalized.

(b) Where an installment plan is contemplated and the amount of the late charges in relation to the amount of reasonably affordable installment payments is so large that the debt may never be paid, late charges may be waived.
