#### § 30.12 Q-12: What actions are necessary for a TARP recipient to comply with section 111(d) of EESA (the excessive or luxury expenditures policy requirement)?

To comply with section 111(d) of EESA, by the later of ninety days after the closing date of the agreement between the TARP recipient and Treasury or September 14, 2009, the board of directors of the TARP recipient must adopt an excessive or luxury expenditures policy, provide this policy to Treasury and its primary regulatory agency, and post the text of this policy on its Internet Web site, if the TARP recipient maintains a company Web site. After adoption of the policy, the TARP recipient must maintain the policy during the remaining TARP period (if the TARP recipient has an obligation), or through the last day of the TARP recipient's fiscal year including the sunset date (if the TARP recipient has never had an obligation). If, after adopting an excessive or luxury expenditures policy, the board of directors of the TARP recipient makes any material amendments to this policy, within ninety days of the adoption of the amended policy, the board of directors must provide the amended policy to Treasury and its primary regulatory agency and post the amended policy on its Internet Web site, if the TARP recipient maintains a company Web site. This disclosure must continue through the TARP period (if the TARP recipient has an obligation), or through the last day of the TARP recipient's fiscal year that includes the sunset date (if the TARP recipient has never had an obligation).
