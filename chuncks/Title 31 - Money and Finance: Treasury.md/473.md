##### § 5.17 Will a debtor who owes a Treasury debt be ineligible for Federal loan assistance or Federal licenses, permits or privileges?
###### Delinquent debtors barred from obtaining Federal loans or loan insurance or guaranties.

(a)As required by 31 U.S.C. 3720B and 31 CFR 901.6, Treasury entities will not extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a debt owed to a Federal agency. This prohibition does not apply to disaster loans. Treasury entities may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved. See 31 CFR 285.13 for standards defining when a "delinquency" is "resolved" for purposes of this prohibition.
