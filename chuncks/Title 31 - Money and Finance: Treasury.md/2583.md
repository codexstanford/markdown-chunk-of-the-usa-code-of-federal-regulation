###### § 92.17 Final action.

(a) In making a final determination whether to impose a penalty, the assessing official shall take into consideration the entire report prepared by the examining official. Although the assessing official should accord appropriate weight to the findings and recommendations of the examining official, the assessing official is not bound by them. The assessing official may approve, disapprove, modify, or substitute any or all of the examining official's findings and recommendations if, in his or her judgment, the evidence in the record supports such a decision. The assessing official will determine whether:

(1) The facts warrant a conclusion that no violation has occurred; or

(2)(i) The facts warrant a conclusion that one or more violations have occurred; and

(ii) The facts and violations found justify the conclusion that a civil penalty should be imposed.

(b) If the assessing official determines that no violation has occurred, the official shall promptly send a letter indicating that determination to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.

(c) If the assessing official determines that a violation has occurred:

(1) The assessing official shall issue a Final Notice of Assessment to the person served with an Initial Notice of Assessment and to any designated representative of such person.

(2) The assessing official may, in his or her discretion:

(i) Impose a civil penalty;

(ii) Not impose a civil penalty; or

(iii) Impose a civil penalty and suspend the payment of all or some of the civil penalty, conditioned on the violator's future compliance with 31 U.S.C. 333.

(3) If a civil penalty is imposed under § 92.17(c)(2)(i) or (iii), the assessing official shall determine the appropriate amount of the penalty in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 333(c)(2). In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the assessing official will consider relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:

(i) The scope of the misuse;

(ii) The purpose and/or nature of the misuse;

(iii) The extent of the harm caused by the misuse;

(iv) The circumstances of the misuse;

(v) The commercial benefit intended to be derived from the misuse; and

(vi) The repeated nature of the misuse.

(4) The Final Notice of Assessment shall:

(i) Include the following:

(A) A specific reference to each provision of § 92.13 found to have been violated;

(B) A concise statement of the facts supporting a conclusion that each violation has occurred;

(C) An analysis of how the facts and each violation justifies the conclusion that a civil penalty should be imposed; and

(D) The amount of each civil penalty imposed and a statement as to how the amount of each penalty was determined; and

(ii) Inform the person of the following:

(A) Payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment must be made within 30 days of the date of the notice;

(B) Payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment shall be paid by EFT in accordance with instructions provided in the notice, unless the assessing official has given written approval to have payment made by other means;

(C) If payment of a civil penalty imposed by the Final Notice of Assessment has been suspended on the condition that the person comply in the future with 31 U.S.C. 333 and this subpart, the failure by the person to so comply will make the civil penalty payable on demand;

(D) If a civil penalty is not paid within 30 days of the date of the Final Notice of Assessment (or on demand under paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D) of this section), a civil action to collect the penalty or enforce compliance may be commenced at any time within two years of the date of the Final Notice of Assessment; and
