Every permit shall describe the location of the vending facility, including any vending machines located on other than facility premises, and shall be subject to the following provisions:

(a) The permit shall be issued in the name of the applicant State licensing agency which shall perform the responsibilities set forth in 34 CFR 395.35 (a);

(b) The permit shall be issued for an indefinite period of time subject to suspension or termination on the basis of compliance or noncompliance with agreed upon terms.

(c) The permit shall provide that:

(1) No charge shall be made to the State licensing agency for normal cleaning, maintenance, and repair of the building structure in and adjacent to the vending facility areas;

(2) Cleaning necessary for sanitation; the maintenance of vending facilities and vending machines in an orderly condition at all times; the installation, maintenance, repair, replacement, servicing, and removal of vending facility equipment shall be without cost to the Department of the Treasury; and

(3) Articles sold at vending facilities operated by blind licensees may consist of newspapers, periodicals, publications, confections, tobacco products, foods, beverages, chances for any lottery authorized by State law and conducted by an agency of a State within such State, and other articles or services as are determined by the State licensing agency, in consultation with the appropriate Treasury bureau, to be suitable for a particular location. Such articles and services may be dispensed automatically or manually and may be prepared on or off the premises.

(d) The permit shall further provide that vending facilities shall be operated in compliance with applicable health, sanitation, and building codes or ordinances.

(e) The permit shall further provide that installation, modification, relocation, removal, and renovation of vending facilities shall be subject to the prior approval and supervision of the bureau on-site property management officer of the appropriate Treasury bureau and the State licensing agency; that costs of relocations initiated by the State licensing agency shall be paid by the State licensing agency; that costs of relocations initiated by a Treasury bureau shall be paid by the Treasury bureau; and that all plumbing, electrical, and mechanical costs related to the renovation of existing facilities shall be paid by the appropriate Treasury bureau.
