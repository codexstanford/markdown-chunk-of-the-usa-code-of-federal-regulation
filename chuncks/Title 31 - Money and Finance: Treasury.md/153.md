## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of the Treasury
### PART 1 - DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS
#### Subpart C - Privacy Act
##### § 1.20 Purpose and scope of this subpart.

(a) The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). This subpart applies to all records which are contained in systems of records maintained by the Department of the Treasury (Department or Treasury). They do not relate to those personnel records of Federal Government employees, which are under the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) jurisdiction to the extent such records are subject to OPM regulations. This subpart applies to all Treasury components. Any reference in this subpart to the Department or its officials, employees, or records must be deemed to refer also to the components or their officials, employees, or records. This subpart sets forth the requirements applicable to Treasury employees (including, to the extent required by the contract or 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), Government contractors and employees of such contractors) maintaining, collecting, using, or disseminating records pertaining to individuals. They also set forth the procedures by which individuals may request notification of whether the Treasury maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to them or may seek access to such records maintained in any nonexempt system of records, request correction of such records, appeal any initial adverse determination of any request for amendment, or seek an accounting of disclosures of such records. For the convenience of interested persons, Treasury components may reproduce the regulations in this subpart in their entirety (less any appendices not applicable to the component in question) in those titles of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) which normally contain regulations applicable to such components. In connection with such reproduction, and at other appropriate times, components may issue supplementary regulations applicable only to the component in question, which are consistent with the regulations in this subpart. In the event of any actual or apparent inconsistency, the Departmentwide regulations in this subpart must govern. Individuals interested in the records of a particular component should, therefore, also consult the Code of Federal Regulations for any rules or regulations promulgated specifically with respect to that component (see the appendices to this subpart for cross references). The head of each component is hereby also authorized to substitute other appropriate officials for those designated and correct addresses specified in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the component.
