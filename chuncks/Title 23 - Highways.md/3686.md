(a) To initiate an NDR file check, an individual who is employed or seeking employment as a motor vehicle operator; who has applied for or received an airman's certificate; who is employed or seeking employment as a locomotive operator; who holds or has applied for a license, certificate of registry, or a merchant mariner's document or is an officer, chief warrant officer, or enlisted member of the U.S. Coast Guard or Coast Guard Reserve; or who is seeking employment as pilot with an air carrier; or an individual subject to a personnel security investigation; shall either:

(1) Complete, sign and submit a request for an NDR file check directly to the chief driver licensing official of a participating State in accordance with procedures established by that State for this purpose; or

(2) Authorize, by completing and signing a written consent, the authorized NDR user to request a file check through the chief driver licensing official of a participating State in accordance with the procedures established by that State for this purpose.

(b) If the authorized NDR user is an employer or prospective employer of a motor vehicle operator, the request for an NDR file check must be submitted through the chief driver licensing official of the State in which the individual is licensed to operate a motor vehicle.

(c) If the authorized NDR user is the head of a Federal department or agency, the request for an NDR file check may be submitted instead directly to the NDR in accordance with procedures established by the NDR for this purpose.

(d) The request for an NDR file check or the written consent, whichever is used, must:

(1) State that the NDR records are to be released;

(2) State as specifically as possible who is authorized to receive the records;

(3) Be signed and dated by the individual (or the individual's legal representative as appropriate);

(4) Specifically state that the authorization is valid for only one search of the NDR (or in the case of a personnel security investigation state that the authorization is valid only for the duration of the investigation); and

(5) Except for inquiries concerning personnel security investigations, specifically state that the NDR identifies probable matches that require further inquiry for verification; that it is recommended, but not required, that the employer/prospective employer verify matches with the State of Record; and that individuals have the right to request records regarding themselves from the NDR to verify their accuracy.
