The obligation authority associated with these funds is subject to the limitation on obligation pursuant to section 1102 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).

(b) As soon as practicable after the apportionment in a fiscal year, but in no event later than September 30 of the fiscal year, the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety and the Secretary of the State's Department of Transportation for each State that receives an apportionment shall jointly identify, in writing to the appropriate NHTSA Regional Administrator, the amounts of the State's apportionment that will be obligated to highway safety program areas and to Federal-aid highway projects. Each NHTSA Regional Administrator will forward copies of the joint letters to the appropriate NHTSA and FHWA offices.

(c) Apportionments will not be made by the NHTSA and FHWA unless this letter from the State is received.
