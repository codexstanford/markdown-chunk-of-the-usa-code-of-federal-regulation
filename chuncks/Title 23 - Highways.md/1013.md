Inasmuch as a primary objective of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 is to provide employment, the State highway department further agrees that in addition to the other applicable provisions of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, part 21, § 21.5(c)(1), and paragraphs (2)(iii) and (2)(v) of appendix C thereof, shall be applicable to all employment practices in connection with this project, and to the State's employment practices with respect to those employees connected with the Appalachian Highway Program."
