(b) Identification of key linkages between one or more modes of transportation, where the performance or use of one mode will affect another;

(c) Definition of strategies for improving the effectiveness of these modal interactions; and

(d) Evaluation and implementation of these strategies to enhance the overall performance of the transportation system.
