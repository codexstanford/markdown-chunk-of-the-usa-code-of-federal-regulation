(1) That any significant revision in the design, construction, or use of the facility for which the land was made available shall receive prior review and approval by the State highway agency.

(2) The use of the lands made available to the publicly-owned mass transit authority shall not be transferred to another party without the prior approval of the State highway agency.

(3) That, if the publicly-owned mass transit authority fails within a reasonable or agreed time to use the land for the purpose for which it was made available, or if it abandons the land or the facility developed, such use shall terminate. Any abandoned facility developed or under development by the publicly-owned mass transit authority which was financed all or in part with Federal funds shall be disposed of in a manner prescribed by OMB Circular A-102, Attachment N. The land shall revert to the State for its original intended highway purpose.
