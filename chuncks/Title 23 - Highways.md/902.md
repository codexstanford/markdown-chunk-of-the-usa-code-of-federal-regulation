###### § 620.103 Policy.

(a) Federal-aid highway funds shall not participate in the costs of reconstruction or relocation of any highway to which this section applies unless the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and State officials, in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or appropriate military authority, or in the case of privately owned airports, the owner of that airport, determine that the location or extension of the airport in question and the consequent relocation or reconstruction of the highway is in the public interest.
