###### § 810.308 Approval of urban system nonhighway public mass transit projects.

(a) An urban system public mass transit project may be approved by the UMTA Administrator when it is determined that:

(1) The application and project are in accordance with the current UMTA procedures relating to discretionary capital assistance grants; and

(2) Notification has been received from the FHWA Administrator that sufficient apportioned Federal-aid urban system funds are available to finance the Federal share of the cost of the proposed project.

(b) Approval of the plans, specifications, and estimates of a nonhighway public mass transit project shall be deemed to occur on the date the UMTA Administrator approves the project application. This approval which is subject to the availability of obligation authority at the time of approval, will obligate the United States to pay its proportional share of the cost of the project.

(c) Upon approval of an urban system nonhighway public mass transit project, the UMTA Administrator will execute a grant contract covering implementation of the project.
