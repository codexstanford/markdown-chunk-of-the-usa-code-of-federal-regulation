###### § 50.20 Preparation and submission of MSHA Report Form 7000-1 - Mine Accident, Injury, and Illness Report.

(a) Each operator shall maintain at the mine office a supply of MSHA Mine Accident, Injury, and Illness Report Form 7000-1. These may be obtained from the MSHA District Office. Each operator shall report each accident, occupational injury, or occupational illness at the mine. The principal officer in charge of health and safety at the mine or the supervisor of the mine area in which an accident or occupational injury occurs, or an occupational illness may have originated, shall complete or review the form in accordance with the instructions and criteria in §§ 50.20-1 through 50.20-7. If an occupational illness is diagnosed as being one of those listed in § 50.20-6(b)(7), the operator must report it under this part. The operator shall mail completed forms to MSHA within ten working days after an accident or occupational injury occurs or an occupational illness is diagnosed. When an accident specified in § 50.10 occurs, which does not involve an occupational injury, sections A, B, and items 5 through 12 of section C of Form 7000-1 shall be completed and mailed to MSHA in accordance with the instructions in § 50.20-1 and criteria contained in §§ 50.20-4 through 50.20-6.

(b) Each operator shall report each occupational injury or occupational illness on one set of forms. If more than one miner is injured in the same accident or is affected simultaneously with the same occupational illness, an operator shall complete a separate set of forms for each miner affected. To the extent that the form is not self-explanatory, an operator shall complete the form in accordance with the instructions in § 50.20-1 and criteria contained in §§ 50.20-2 through 50.20-7.
