###### Inspections of Operations
####### § 250.130 Why does BSEE conduct inspections?

BSEE will inspect OCS facilities and any vessels engaged in drilling or other downhole operations. These include facilities under jurisdiction of other Federal agencies that we inspect by agreement. We conduct these inspections:

(a) To verify that you are conducting operations according to the Act, the regulations, the lease, right-of-way, the BOEM-approved Exploration Plan or Development and Production Plans; or right-of-use and easement, and other applicable laws and regulations; and

(b) To determine whether equipment designed to prevent or ameliorate blowouts, fires, spillages, or other major accidents has been installed and is operating properly according to the requirements of this part.
