####### § 585.422 When can my lease or grant be canceled?

(a) The Secretary will cancel any lease or grant issued under this part upon proof that it was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, and after notice and opportunity to be heard has been afforded to the lessee or grant holder.

(b) The Secretary may cancel any lease or grant issued under this part when:

(1) The Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for a hearing that, with respect to the lease or grant that would be canceled, the lessee or grantee has failed to comply with any applicable provision of the OCS Lands Act or these regulations; any order of the Director; or any term, condition or stipulation contained in the lease or grant, and that the failure to comply continued 30 days (or other period BOEM specifies) after you receive notice from BOEM. The Secretary will mail a notice by registered or certified letter to the lessee or grantee at its record post office address;

(3) Required by national security or defense; or

(4) The Secretary determines after notice and opportunity for a hearing that continued activity under the lease or grant:

(ii) That the threat of harm or damage would not disappear or decrease to an acceptable extent within a reasonable period of time; and
