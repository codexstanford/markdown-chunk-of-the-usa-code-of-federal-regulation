###### § 586.114 How will data and information obtained by BOEM under this part be disclosed to the public?

(a) BOEM will make data and information available in accordance with the requirements and subject to the limitations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552) and the regulations contained in 43 CFR part 2.

We will review such data and information and objections of the submitter to determine whether release at that time will result in substantial competitive harm or disclosure of trade secrets.

(c) After considering any objections from the submitter, if we determine that release of such data and information will result in:

(1) No substantial competitive harm or disclosure of trade secrets, then the data and information will be released.

(2) Substantial competitive harm or disclosure of trade secrets, then the data and information will not be released at that time but will be subject to further review every 3 years thereafter.
