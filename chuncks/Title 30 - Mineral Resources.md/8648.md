Such plans must describe the methods to be employed to minimize damage to non-commercial buildings and occupied residential dwellings and related structures or written consent from the owner of the structure or facility that minimization measures not be taken, or unless the damage would constitute a threat to health or safety, a demonstration that the costs of minimizing damage exceed anticipated costs of repair.

(2) At 11 AAC 90.321(e)(1), in accordance with 30 CFR 816.41(h), Alaska must submit a program amendment (or description of the amendment with a timetable for submission) to revise 11 AAC 90.321(e)(1) to ensure protection of water supplies affected by surface coal mining activities conducted on or before October 24, 1992.

(3) At 11 AAC 90.652(g)(1) and 11 AAC 90.664(c), in accordance with the requirements at 30 CFR 702.11(f)(1) and 702.17(c)(2), Alaska must submit a program amendment (or description of the amendment with a timetable for submission) to restore the 30-day time frames under 11 AAC 90.652(g)(1) and 11 AAC 90.664(c) for an adversely affected person to request administrative review of the agency's decisions regarding incidental mining exemptions.

The amendment or its description must include the requirement that the information, unless approved as confidential, will be made available for public inspection and copying until at least three years after expiration of the period during which the subject mining area is active.

(5) At AS 27.21.220, in accordance with the October 24, 1992, Energy Policy Act, Alaska must submit a statutory revision requiring prompt repair or compensation for material damage resulting from subsidence, and prompt replacement of water supplies affected by underground mining operations.
