###### § 43.2 General.

(a) Under section 103(g)(1) of the Act, a representative of miners, or where there is no such representative, a miner, who has reasonable grounds to believe that a violation of the act or a mandatory health or safety standard exists, or an imminent danger exists, has a right to obtain a special inspection if he or she gives notice of such violation to the Secretary or his duly authorized representative. The notice shall be reduced to writing and signed by the miners' representative or miner, and a copy that does not reveal the name of the person giving the notice must be served on the operator no later than at the time of the inspection. If the Secretary determines that a violation or danger does not exist, he must so notify the miners' representative or miner in writing.

(b) Under section 103(g)(2) of the Act, a representative of miners or, if there is no such representative, a miner, may notify in writing an authorized representative of the Secretary who is on mine premises prior to or during an inspection, of any violation or imminent danger which he or she has reason to believe exists in the mine. There shall be procedures for the informal review of any refusal by the Secretary's authorized representative to issue a citation with respect to such alleged violation or danger, including notification to the miners' representative or miner of the reasons for his disposition of the case.
