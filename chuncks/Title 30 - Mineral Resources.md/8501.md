##### § 875.15 Reclamation priorities for noncoal program.

(a) This section applies to reclamation projects involving the restoration of lands and water adversely affected by past mineral mining; projects involving the protection, repair, replacement, construction, or enhancement of utilities (such as those relating to water supply, roads, and other such facilities serving the public adversely affected by mineral mining and processing practices); and the construction of public facilities in communities impacted by coal or other mineral mining and processing practices.

(b) Following certification pursuant to § 875.13, the projects and construction of public facilities identified in paragraph (a) of this section shall reflect the following priorities in the order stated:

(1) The protection of public health, safety, general welfare and property from the extreme danger of adverse effects of mineral mining and processing practices;

(2) The protection of public health, safety, and general welfare from the adverse effects of mineral mining and processing practices; and

(3) The restoration of land and water resources and the environment previously degraded by the adverse effects of mineral mining and processing practices.

(c) Enhancement of facilities or utilities shall include upgrading necessary to meet local, State, or Federal public health or safety requirements. Enhancement shall not include, however, any service area expansion of a utility or facility not necessary to address a specific abandoned mine land problem.

(d) Notwithstanding the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section, where the Governor of a State or the equivalent head of an Indian tribe, after determining that there is a need for activities or construction of specific public facilities related to the coal or minerals industry in States or on Tribal lands impacted by coal or minerals development, submits a grant application as required by paragraph (e) of this section and the Director concurs in such need, as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section, the Director may grant funds made available under section 402(g)(1) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1232, to carry out such activities or construction.

(e) To qualify for funding pursuant to the authority in paragraph (d) of this section, a State or Indian tribe must submit a grant application that specifically sets forth:

(1) The need or urgency for the activity or the construction of the public facility;

(2) The expected impact the project will have on the coal or minerals industry in the State or Indian tribe;

(3) The availability of funding from other sources and, if other funding is provided, its percentage of the total costs involved;

(4) Documentation from other local, State, and Federal agencies with oversight for such utilities or facilities regarding what funding resources they have available and why this specific project is not being fully funded by their agency;

(5) The impact on the State or Indian tribe, the public, and the minerals industry if the activity or facility is not funded;

(6) The reason why this project should be selected before a priority project relating to the protection of the public health and safety or the environment from the damages caused by past mining activities; and

(7) An analysis and review of the procedures used by the State or Indian tribe to notify and involve the public in this funding request and a copy of all comments received and their resolution by the State or Indian tribe.

(f) After review of the information contained in the application, the Director will, if necessary to ensure adequate public notification, prepare anotice regarding the State's or Indian Tribe's submission and provide for public comment. The Director will then:

(1) Evaluate any comments received;

(2) Determine whether the funding meets the requirements of this part;

(3) Determine whether the funding is in the best interest of the State or Indian tribe AML program;

(4) If the determinations under paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section are positive, approve the request for funding the activity or construction; and

(5) Approve funding under paragraph (f)(4) of this section only at a cost commensurate with its benefits towards achieving the purposes of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
