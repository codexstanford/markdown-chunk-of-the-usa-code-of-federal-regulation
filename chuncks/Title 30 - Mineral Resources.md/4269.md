(2) The well's fluid handling systems on the rig; and

(3) The well's downhole conditions as monitored by a downhole sensing system, when such a system is installed.

(b) During well operations, you must transmit the data identified in paragraph (a) of this section as they are gathered, barring unforeseeable or unpreventable interruptions in transmission, and have the capability to monitor the data onshore, using qualified personnel. Onshore personnel who monitor real-time data must have the capability to contact rig personnel during operations.
