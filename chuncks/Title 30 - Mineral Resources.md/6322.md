(b) The implementing regulations at 43 CFR part 2;

(c) The Act; and

(d) The regulations at 30 CFR parts 550 and 552.

(1) If the RD determines that any data or information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, we will not disclose the data and information unless either:

(i) You and all third parties agree to the disclosure; or

(ii) A provision of 30 CFR parts 550 and 552 allows us to make the disclosure.

(2) We will keep confidential the identity of third-party recipients of data and information collected under a permit. We will not release the identity unless you and the third parties agree to the disclosure.

The announcement must further the National interest without unduly damaging your competitive position.
