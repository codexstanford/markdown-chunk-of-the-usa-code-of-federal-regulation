Lamps used in all other places must be of substantial construction and be fitted with a glass enclosure.

(b) Incandescent lamps within glass enclosures or fluorescent lamps may be used inside underground structures (except magazines used for the storage of explosives and detonators). In underground structures lighting circuits shall consist of cables installed on insulators or insulated wires installed in metallic conduit or metallic armor.
