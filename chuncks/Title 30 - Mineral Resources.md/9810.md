On November 29, 1950 (15 FR 8585), a new lease form was adopted (Form 4-1158, 15 FR 8585) containing provisions whereby the lessee agrees that nothing in any contract or other arrangement made for the sale or disposal of oil, gas, natural gasoline, and other products of the leased land, shall be construed as modifying any of the provisions of the lease, including, but not limited to, provisions relating to gas waste, taking royalty-in-kind, and the method of computing royalties due as based on a minimum valuation and in accordance with the oil and gas valuation regulations. A contract or agreement pursuant to a lease containing such provisions may be made without obtaining prior approval of the United States as lessor, but must be retained as provided in § 1207.5 of this subpart.
