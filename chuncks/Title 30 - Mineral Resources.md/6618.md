####### § 585.536 How will I be notified of a call for forfeiture?

(a) BOEM will notify you and your surety, including any provider of financial assurance, in writing of the call for forfeiture and provide the reasons for the forfeiture and the amount to be forfeited. We will base the amount upon an estimate of the total cost of corrective action to bring your lease or grant into compliance.

(b) We will advise you and your surety that you may avoid forfeiture if, within 10 business days:

(1) You agree to and demonstrate in writing to BOEM that you will bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe we prescribe, and you do so; or

(2) Your surety agrees to and demonstrates that it will bring your lease or grant into compliance within the timeframe we prescribe, even if the cost of compliance exceeds the face amount of the bond.
