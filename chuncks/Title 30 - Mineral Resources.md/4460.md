####### § 250.810 Dry tree subsurface safety devices - general.

For wells using dry trees or for which you intend to install dry trees, you must equip all tubing installations open to hydrocarbon-bearing zones with subsurface safety devices that will shut off the flow from the well in the event of an emergency unless, after you submit a request containing a justification, the District Manager determines the well to be incapable of natural flow. You must install flow couplings above and below the subsurface safety devices. These subsurface safety devices include the following devices and any associated safety valve lock and landing nipple:

(a) An SSSV, including either:

(1) A surface-controlled SSSV; or

(2) A subsurface-controlled SSSV.

(b) An injection valve.

(c) A tubing plug.

(d) A tubing/annular subsurface safety device.
