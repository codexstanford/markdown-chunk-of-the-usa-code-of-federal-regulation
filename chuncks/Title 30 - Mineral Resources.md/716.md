(b) The following types of equipment may be approved: Dust-collector or combination units having components designed specifically to prevent dissemination of airborne dust generated by drilling into coal-mine rock strata in concentrations in excess of those hereinafter stated in § 33.33 as allowable, and to confine or control the collected dust in such manner that it may be removed or disposed of without dissemination into the mine atmosphere in quantities that would create unhygienic conditions.
