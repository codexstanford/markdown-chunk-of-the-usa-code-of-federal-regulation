(2) Where the applicant for approval has used an independent laboratory under part 6 of this chapter to perform, in whole or in part, the necessary testing and evaluation for approval of changes to an approved product under this part, the applicant must provide to MSHA as part of the approval application:

(i) Written evidence of the laboratory's independence and current recognition by a laboratory accrediting organization;

(ii) Complete technical explanation of how the product complies with each requirement in the applicable MSHA product approval requirements;

(iii) Identification of components or features of the product that are critical to the safety of the product; and

(iv) All documentation, including drawings and specifications, as submitted to the independent laboratory by the applicant and as required by this part.

(b) The application will be examined by MSHA to determine whether inspection and testing of the modified system or component or of a part will be required. MSHA will inform the applicant whether testing is required and the component or components and related material to be submitted for that purpose.

(c) If the proposed modification meets the requirements of this part, a formal extension of certification will be issued, accompanied by a list of revised drawings and specifications which MSHA has added to those already on file.
