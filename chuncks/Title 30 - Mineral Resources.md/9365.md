###### § 1204.211 When may ONRR rescind relief for a property?

(a) ONRR may retroactively rescind the relief for your property if ONRR determines that your property was not eligible for the relief obtained under this subpart because:

(1) You did not submit a notice or request for relief under § 1204.205;

(2) You submitted erroneous information in the notice or request for relief you provided to ONRR under § 1204.205 or in your royalty or production reports; or

(3) Your property is no longer eligible for relief because production increased, but you failed to provide the notice required under § 1204.209(b).

(b) ONRR may rescind relief for your property if ONRR decides to take royalty in kind.
