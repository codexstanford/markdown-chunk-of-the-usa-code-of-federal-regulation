###### § 282.14 Noncompliance, remedies, and penalties.

(a)(1) If the Director determines that a lessee has failed to comply with applicable provisions of law; the regulations in this part; other applicable regulations; the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and the Director determines that such noncompliance poses a threat of immediate, serious, or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine or the deposit being mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other resources, the Director shall order the lessee to take immediate and appropriate remedial action to alleviate the threat. Any oral orders shall be followed up by service of a notice of noncompliance upon the lessee by delivery in person to the lessee or agent, or by certified or registered mail addressed to the lessee at the last known address.

(2) If the Director determines that the lessee has failed to comply with applicable provisions of law; the regulations in this part; other applicable regulations; the lease; the requirements of an approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and such noncompliance does not pose a threat of immediate, serious, or irreparable damage to the environment, the mine or the deposit being mined, or other valuable mineral deposits or other resources, the Director shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the lessee by delivery in person to the lessee or agent or by certified or registered mail addressed to the lessee at the last known address.

(b) A notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect(s) the lessee has failed to comply with the provisions of applicable law; regulations; the lease; the requirements of an approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; or the Director's orders or instructions, and shall specify the action(s) which must be taken to correct the noncompliance and the time limits within which such action must be taken.

(c) Failure of a lessee to take the actions specified in the notice of noncompliance within the time limit specified shall be grounds for a suspension of operations and other appropriate actions, including but not limited to the assessment of a civil penalty of up to $40,000 per day for each violation that is not corrected within the time period specified (43 U.S.C. 1350(b)).

(d) Whenever the Director determines that a violation of or failure to comply with any provision of the Act; or any provision of a lease, license, or permit issued pursuant to the Act; or any provision of any regulation promulgated under the Act probably occurred and that such apparent violation continued beyond notice of the violation and the expiration of the reasonable time period allowed for corrective action, the Director shall follow the procedures concerning remedies and penalties in subpart N, Remedies and Penalties, of 30 CFR part 250 to determine and assess an appropriate penalty.

(e) The remedies and penalties prescribed in this section shall be concurrent and cumulative, and the exercise of one shall not preclude the exercise of the other. Further, the remedies and penalties prescribed in this section shall be in addition to any other remedies and penalties afforded by any other law or regulation (43 U.S.C. 1350(e)).
