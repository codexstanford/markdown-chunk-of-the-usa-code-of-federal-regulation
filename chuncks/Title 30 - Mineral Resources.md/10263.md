###### § 1228.5 Delegation of authority.

(a) Authority to enter into cooperative agreements to carry out audit and related investigation and enforcement activities with State and tribal governments has been delegated to the Director of the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR).

(b) Authority to enter into cooperative agreements with State and tribal governments to carry out inspection and related investigation and enforcement activities has been delegated to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and is not covered by this part.

(c) The entry into a cooperative agreement with either ONRR or BLM will not affect the ability of a State or Indian tribe to choose to enter into such an agreement with the other agency. A State may enter into a delegation agreement (30 U.S.C. 1735) with ONRR to perform certain functions without affecting its ability to enter into a cooperative agreement with either ONRR or BLM, or both, to cooperate in the performance of those functions which are not delegated in this part.
