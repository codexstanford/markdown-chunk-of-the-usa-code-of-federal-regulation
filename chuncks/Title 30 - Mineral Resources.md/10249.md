(a) Correcting all fatal errors and assigning appropriate confirmation indicators;

(b) Verifying whether production reports are missing;

(c) Contacting production reporters or royalty reporters about missing reports and resolving exceptions;

(d) Documenting all corrections made, including providing production reporters or royalty reporters with confirmation reports of any changes;

(e) Providing training and assistance to production reporters or royalty reporters;

(f) Issuing notices, orders to report, and bills as needed, including, but not limited to, imposing assessments on a person who chronically submits erroneous reports; and

(g) Providing assistance to ONRR for appealed demands or orders, including preparing field reports, performing remanded actions, modifying orders, and providing oral and written briefing and testimony as expert witnesses.
