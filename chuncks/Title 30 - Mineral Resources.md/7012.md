## Chapter VII - Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Department of the Interior
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 706 - RESTRICTION ON FINANCIAL INTERESTS OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES
##### § 706.13 When to file.

(a) Employees performing functions or duties under the Act will be required to file:

(1) Within 120 days of the effective date of these regulations, and

(2) Annually on February 1 of each year or at such other date as may be agreed to by the Director, provided that such alternative date will allow sufficient time to obtain information needed by the Director for his or her annual report to the Congress.

(b) New employees hired, appointed, or transferred to perform functions or duties under the Act will be required to file at the time of entrance to duty.

(c) New employees are not required to file an annual statement on the subsequent annual filing date if this date occurs within two months after their initial statement was filed. For example, an employee entering duty on December 1, 1978 would file a statement on that date. Because December 1 is within two months of February 1 the employee would not be required to file his or her next annual statement until February 1, 1980.
