(3) Refuse to admit our authorized representatives onto the site of a surface coal mining and reclamation operation;

(4) Refuse to allow our authorized representatives to inspect a surface coal mining and reclamation operation;

(5) Refuse to furnish any information or report that we request under the Act or regulatory program; or

(6) Refuse to allow access to, or copying of, those records that we determine necessary to carry out the provisions of the Act and its implementing regulations.
