###### § 71.701 Sampling; general requirements.

(a) Air samples will be taken by the Secretary and will be analyzed to determine the concentrations of noxious or poisonous gases, dusts, fumes, mists, and vapors in surface installations and at surface worksites.

(b) Upon written notification by the Secretary to the operator of an underground coal mine or of a surface coal mine, the operator shall conduct any additional air sampling tests and analyses as the Secretary may from time to time require in order to ensure compliance with the standards set forth in § 71.700 in each surface installation and at each surface worksite.

(c) Where concentrations of airborne contaminants in excess of the applicable threshold limit values, permissible exposure limits, or permissible excursions are known by the operator to exist in a surface installation or at a surface worksite, the operator shall immediately provide necessary control measures to assure compliance with § 71.700 or § 71.702, as applicable.

(d) Where the operator has reasonable grounds to believe that concentrations of airborne contaminants in excess of the applicable threshold limit values, permissible exposure limits, or permissible excursions exist, or are likely to exist, the operator shall promptly conduct appropriate air sampling tests to determine the concentration of any airborne contaminant which may be present and immediately provide the necessary control measures to assure compliance with § 71.700 or § 71.702, as applicable.
