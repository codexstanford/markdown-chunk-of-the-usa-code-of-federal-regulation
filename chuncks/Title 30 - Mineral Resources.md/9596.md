###### § 1206.163 What are my reporting requirements under a non-arm's-length processing contract?

(a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on non-arm's-length processing costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).

(b)(1) For new non-arm's-length processing facilities or arrangements, you must base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable gas processing costs for the applicable period.

(2) You must use your or your affiliate's most recently available operations data for the processing plant as your estimate, if available. If such data is not available, you must use estimates based on data for similar processing plants.

(3) Section 1206.165 applies when you amend your report based on your actual costs.

(c) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit all data used to calculate the allowance deduction. You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.

(d) If you are authorized under § 1206.161(j) to use an exception to the requirement to calculate your actual processing costs, you must follow the reporting requirements of § 1206.162.
