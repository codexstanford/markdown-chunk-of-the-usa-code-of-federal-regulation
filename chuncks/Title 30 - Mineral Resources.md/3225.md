(1) Be maintained at a pressure consistent with the pipe, fittings, valves, and nozzles used in the system.

(2) Be located so as to be protected against damage during operation of the equipment protected.

(3) Employ liquid which is free from excessive sediment and noncorrosive to the system.

(4) Include strainers equipped with flush-out connections or equivalent protective devices and a rising stem or other visual indicator-type shutoff valve.
