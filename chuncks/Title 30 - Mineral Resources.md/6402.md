(a) The Director shall make data, information, and samples available in accordance with the requirements and subject to the limitations of the Act, the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), and the implementing regulations (43 CFR part 2).

(b) Geophysical data, processed G&G information, interpreted G&G information, and other data and information submitted pursuant to the requirements of this part shall not be available for public inspection without the consent of the lessee so long as the lease remains in effect, unless the Director determines that earlier limited release of such information is necessary for the unitization of operations on two or more leases, to ensure proper Mining Plans for a common orebody, or to promote operational safety. When the Director determines that early limited release of data and information is necessary, the data and information shall be shown only to persons with a direct interest in the affected lease(s), unitization agreement, or joint Mining Plan.
