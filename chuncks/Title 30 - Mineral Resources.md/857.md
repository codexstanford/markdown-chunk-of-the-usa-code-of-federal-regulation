###### § 41.10 Scope.

Section 109(d) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 91-173, as amended by Pub. L. 95-164), requires each operator of a coal or other mine to file with the Secretary of Labor the name and address of such mine, the name and address of the person who controls or operates the mine, and any revisions in such names and addresses. Section 103(h) of the act requires the operator of a coal or other mine to provide such information as the Secretary of Labor may reasonably require from time to time to enable the Secretary to perform his functions under the act. The regulations in this Subpart B provide for the notification to the Mine Safety and Health Administration of the legal identity of the operator of a coal or other mine and the reporting of all changes in the legal identity of the operator as they occur. The submission of a properly completed Legal Identity Report Form No. 2000-7 required under Subpart C of this part will constitute adequate notification of legal identity to the Mine Safety and Health Administration.
