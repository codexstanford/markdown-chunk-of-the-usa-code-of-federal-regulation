###### § 1219.510 What does this subpart contain?

(a) GOMESA directs the Secretary of the Interior to disburse a portion of the rentals, royalties, bonus bids, and other sums derived from certain OCS leases in the GOM to the States of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (collectively identified as the Gulf producing States); to eligible CPSs within those States; and to the LWCF. GOMESA directs the Gulf producing States and CPSs to use the shared revenues for the following purposes:

(1) Projects and activities for the purpose of coastal protection, including conservation, coastal restoration, hurricane protection, and infrastructure directly affected by coastal wetland losses;

(2) Mitigation of damage to fish, wildlife, or natural resources;

(3) Implementation of a federally-approved marine, coastal, or comprehensive conservation management plan;

(4) Mitigation of the impact of OCS activities through the funding of onshore infrastructure projects; and

(5) Planning assistance and administrative costs not-to-exceed 3 percent of the amounts received.

(b) This subpart sets forth the formula and methodology ONRR will use to determine the amount of revenues allocated and disbursed to each Gulf producing State and each eligible CPS for fiscal year 2017 and each fiscal year thereafter. Leasing revenues disbursed under this subpart (also referred to as GOMESA Phase II) originate from leases issued on or after December 20, 2006, in the 181 Area, the 181 South Area, and the GOM 2002-2007 Planning Area, subject to restrictions and caps identified in GOMESA.
