###### § 582.30 Right of use and easement.

(a) A right of use and easement that includes any area subject to a lease issued or maintained under the Act shall be granted only after the lessee has been notified by the requestor and afforded the opportunity to comment on the request. A holder of a right under a right of use and easement shall exercise that right in accordance with the requirements of the regulations in this part. A right of use and easement shall be exercised only in a manner which does not interfere unreasonably with operations of any lessee on its lease.

(b) Once a right of use and easement has been exercised, the right shall continue, beyond the termination of any lease on which it may be situated, as long as it is demonstrated to the Director that the right of use and easement is being exercised by the holder of the right and that the right of use and easement continues to serve the purpose specified in the grant. If the right of use and easement extends beyond the termination of any lease on which the right may be situated or if it is situated on an unleased portion of the OCS, the rights of all subsequent lessees shall be subject to such right. Upon termination of a right of use and easement, the holder of the right shall abandon the premises in the same manner that a lessee abandons activities on a lease to the satisfaction of the Director.
