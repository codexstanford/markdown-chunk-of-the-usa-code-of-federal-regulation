##### § 700.10 Information collection.
###### et seq.

The collection of information, and recordkeeping requirements, contained in 30 CFR 700.11(d), 700.12(b) and 700.13 has approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501and assigned clearance number 1029-0094. The information collected in § 700.11(d) is used by OSMRE and States to establish standards for determining when a mine site is no longer a surface coal mining and reclamation operation and thereby when regulatory jurisdiction may end. The information collection under § 700.12(b) is used by OSMRE to consider need, costs, and benefits of a proposed regulatory change in order to grant or deny a petition that has been submitted. Information collected in § 700.13 identifies the person and nature of a citizen's suit, so that OSMRE or a state can respond appropriately.
