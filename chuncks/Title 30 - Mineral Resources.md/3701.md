###### § 77.804 High-voltage trailing cables; minimum design requirements.

(a) High-voltage trailing cables used in resistance grounded systems shall be equipped with metallic shields around each power conductor with one or more ground conductors having a total cross-sectional area of not less than one-half the power conductor, and with an insulated conductor for the ground continuity check circuit. External ground check conductors may be used if they are not smaller than No. 8 (AWG) and have an insulation rated at least 600 volts.

(b) All such high-voltage trailing cables shall be adequate for the intended current and voltage. Splices made in such cables shall provide continuity of all components.
