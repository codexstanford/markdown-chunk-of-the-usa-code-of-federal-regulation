(1) Citations for S&S violations;

(2) Orders under section 104(b) of the Mine Act for not abating S&S violations;

(3) Citations and withdrawal orders under section 104(d) of the Mine Act, resulting from the mine operator's unwarrantable failure to comply;

(4) Imminent danger orders under section 107(a) of the Mine Act;

(5) Orders under section 104(g) of the Mine Act requiring withdrawal of miners who have not received training and who MSHA declares to be a hazard to themselves and others;

(6) Enforcement measures, other than section 104(e) of the Mine Act, that have been applied at the mine;

(7) Other information that demonstrates a serious safety or health management problem at the mine, such as accident, injury, and illness records; and

(8) Mitigating circumstances.
