####### § 550.297 What information must a CID contain?
######## i.e.,

(3) Appropriate well logs, including digital well log (gamma ray, resistivity, neutron, density, sonic, caliper curves) curves in an acceptable digital format;

(4) Sidewall core/whole core and pressure-volume-temperature analysis;

(5) Structure maps, with the existing and proposed penetration points and subsea depths for all wells penetrating the reservoirs, fluid contacts (or the lowest or highest known levels in the absence of actual contacts), reservoir boundaries, and the scale of the map;

(6) Interpreted structural cross sections and corresponding interpreted seismic lines or block diagrams, as necessary, that include all current wellbores and planned wellbores on the leases or units to be developed, the reservoir boundaries, fluid contacts, depth scale, stratigraphic positions, and relative biostratigraphic ages;

(7) Isopach maps of each reservoir showing the net feet of pay for each well within the reservoir identified at the penetration point, along with the well name, labeled contours, and scale;

(8) Estimates of original oil and gas in-place and anticipated recoverable oil and gas reserves, all reservoir parameters, and risk factors and assumptions;

(9) Plat map at the same scale as the structure maps with existing and proposed well paths, as well as existing and proposed penetrations;

(10) Wellbore schematics indicating proposed perforations;

(11) Proposed wellbore utility chart showing all existing and proposed wells, with proposed completion intervals indicated for each borehole;

(12) Appropriate pressure data, specified by date, and whether estimated or measured;

(13) Description of reservoir development strategies;

(14) Description of the enhanced recovery practices you will use or, if you do not plan to use such practices, an explanation of the methods you considered and reasons you do not intend to use them;

(15) For each reservoir you do not intend to develop:

(i) A statement explaining the reason(s) you will not develop the reservoir, and

(ii) Economic justification, including costs, recoverable reserve estimate, production profiles, and pricing assumptions; and

(16) Any other appropriate data you used in performing your reservoir evaluations and preparing your reservoir development strategies.
