(1) Persons in shafts and slopes underground;

(2) Persons with an incline hoist on the surface; or

(3) Loads in shaft or slope development when persons work below suspended loads.

(4) These standards do not apply to wire ropes used for elevators.

(c) Emergency hoisting facilities should conform to the extent possible to safety requirements for other hoists, and should be adequate to remove the persons from the mine with a minimum of delay.
