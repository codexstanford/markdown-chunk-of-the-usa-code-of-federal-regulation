#### PART 553 - OIL SPILL FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR OFFSHORE FACILITIES
##### Subpart B - Applicability and Amount of OSFR
###### § 553.14 How do I determine the worst case oil-spill discharge volume?

(a) To calculate the amount of OSFR you must demonstrate for a facility under § 553.13(b), you must use the worst case oil-spill discharge volume that you determined under whichever of the following regulations applies:

(1) 30 CFR part 254-Response Plans for Facilities Located Seaward of the Coast Line, except that the volume of the worst case oil-spill discharge for a well must be four times the uncontrolled flow volume that you estimate for the first 24 hours.

(2) 40 CFR part 112-Oil Pollution Prevention; or

(3) 49 CFR part 194-Response Plans for Onshore Oil Pipelines.

(b) If you are a designated applicant and you choose to demonstrate $150 million in OSFR, you are not required to determine any worst case oil-spill discharge volumes, since that is the maximum amount of OSFR required under this part.
