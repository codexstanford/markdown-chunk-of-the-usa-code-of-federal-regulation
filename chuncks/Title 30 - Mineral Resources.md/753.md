###### § 35.9 Certificates of approval.

(a) Upon completion of an investigation of a hydraulic fluid MSHA will issue to the applicant either a certificate of approval or a written notice of disapproval as the case may require. No informal notification of approval will be issued. If a certificate of approval is issued, no test data or detailed results of tests will accompany it. If a notice of disapproval is issued, it will be accompanied by details of the defect(s), with a view to possible correction. MSHA will not disclose, except to the applicant, any information on a fluid upon which a notice of disapproval has been issued.

(b) A certificate of approval will be accompanied by a list of specifications covering the characteristics of a hydraulic fluid upon which the certificate of approval is based. In addition to the applicant's record of control in maintaining the fire-resistant characteristics, applicants shall keep exact duplicates of the specifications that have been submitted to MSHA and that relate to any fluid which has received a certificate of approval; and these are to be adhered to exactly in production of the certified fluid for commercial purposes.
