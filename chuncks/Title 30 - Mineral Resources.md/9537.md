###### § 1206.117 What interest and penalties apply if I improperly report a transportation allowance?

(a) If you deduct a transportation allowance on form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the oil transported, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter, on the excess allowance amount taken from the date when that amount is taken to the date when you pay the additional royalties due.

(b) If you improperly net a transportation allowance against the oil instead of reporting the allowance as a separate entry on form ONRR-2014, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.
