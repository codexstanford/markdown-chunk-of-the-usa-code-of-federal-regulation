####### § 585.434 When may BOEM authorize facilities to remain in place following termination of a lease or grant?

(a) In your decommissioning application that you submit to BSEE in accordance with 30 CFR 285.902, you may request that certain facilities authorized in your lease or grant remain in place for activities authorized in this part, elsewhere in this subchapter, or by other applicable Federal laws.

(b) BOEM may approve such requests on a case-by-case basis considering the following:

(1) Potential impacts to the marine environment;

(2) Competing uses of the OCS;

(3) Impacts on marine safety and National defense;

(4) Maintenance of adequate financial assurance; and

(5) Other factors determined by the Director.

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if BOEM authorizes facilities to remain in place, the former lessee or grantee under this part remains jointly and severally liable for decommissioning the facility unless satisfactory evidence is provided to BOEM showing that another party has assumed that responsibility and has secured adequate financial assurances.

(d) In your decommissioning application, you may request that certain facilities authorized in your lease or grant be converted to an artificial reef or otherwise toppled in place. BOEM will evaluate all such requests.
