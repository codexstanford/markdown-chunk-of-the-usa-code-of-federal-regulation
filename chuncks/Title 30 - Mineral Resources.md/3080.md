Metallic sheaths, armors and conduits in resistance grounded systems where the enclosed conductors are a part of the system will be approved if a solid connection is made to the neutral conductor; in all other systems, the following methods of grounding will be approved:

(a) A solid connection to a borehole casing having low resistance to earth;

(b) A solid connection to metal waterlines having low resistance to earth;

(c) A solid connection to a grounding conductor, other than the neutral conductor of a resistance grounded system, extending to a low resistance ground field located on the surface;

(d) Any other method of grounding, approved by an authorized representative of the Secretary, which ensures that there is no difference in potential between such metallic enclosures and the earth.
