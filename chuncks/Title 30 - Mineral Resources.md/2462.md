####### § 57.22004 Category placement or change in placement.

The Administrator for Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health (Administrator) shall be responsible for category and subcategory placement, change in placement, and notification of placement of mines.

(6) Notification of the right to appeal the Administrator's determination under § 57.22005.

(b) The operator or the representative of the miners shall have the right to request of the Administrator reassignment of the mine to a more appropriate category or subcategory if, based on operating experience, the conditions set forth in § 57.22003(b) indicate that the hazards of methane exist under circumstances more appropriately governed by a different category or subcategory. In response to such a request, the procedures set forth in paragraph (d) of this section shall apply. While the request for category or subcategory reassignment is pending, the mine shall continue to operate under the standards for the category or subcategory to which originally assigned.

(3) An ignition of methane; or

(4) Air sample results that indicate 0.25 percent or more methane in the mine atmosphere of a Subcategory I-B, I-C, II-B, V-B or Category VI mine.

(d) The Administrator shall promptly appoint an MSHA committee to investigate occurrences reported in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section or requests filed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Upon completion of an investigation, the committee shall make a written report of the findings. These investigations may include an evaluation of the following:

(2) Conditions under which the incident occurred;

(3) Samples and tests;

(4) Physical conditions at the time of the occurrence;

(5) Charts, logs, and records related to the occurrence;

(6) Whether the occurrence is isolated, continuous, or could recur;

(7) Conditions indicating that the hazards of methane no longer exist or exist under circumstances more appropriately governed by a different category or subcategory;

(8) The geology of the mine and the geological area in which the mine is located; and

(9) Statements by witnesses, company officials, employees, and other persons having knowledge of the mine or the occurrence. Representatives of the mine operator, the miners and the appropriate State agency may participate in the investigation.
