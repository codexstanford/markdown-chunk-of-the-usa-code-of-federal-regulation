###### § 33.37 Test procedure.

(a) Roof drilling: Drilling shall be done in friable strata, similar to the roof in the Bureau's Experimental Mine, which tends to produce large scale-like cuttings.

(b) Horizontal drilling: Drilling shall be done in strata comparable in hardness to that of coal-mine draw slate. Holes shall be started near the roof of the test space under conditions simulating the drilling of draw slate in coal mining.

(c) Down drilling: Drilling shall be done in typical mine floor strata with a pneumatic percussion-type drill. Five holes shall be drilled vertically and five holes shall be drilled at an angle.

(d) At MSHA's discretion drilling in "on site" strata may be acceptable in lieu of strata requirements in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. (See § 33.20(a).)
