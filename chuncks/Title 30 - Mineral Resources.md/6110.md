(1) An identification of the areas proposed for leasing and a schedule for, leasing; and

(2) An estimate of the oil and gas resources.

(1) All geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics of the areas proposed for leasing; and

(2) An identification of any field, geological structure, or trap that lies within 3 miles of the State's seaward boundary.

(43 U.S.C. 1337(g)(2)).
