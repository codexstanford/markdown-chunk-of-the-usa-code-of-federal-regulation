###### § 290.3 What is the time limit for filing an appeal?

You must file your appeal within 60 days after you receive BSEE's final decision or order. The 60-day time period applies rather than the time period provided in 43 CFR 4.411(a). A decision or order is received on the date you sign a receipt confirming delivery or, if there is no receipt, the date otherwise documented.
