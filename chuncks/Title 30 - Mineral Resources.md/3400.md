###### § 75.1600-2 Communication facilities; working sections; installation and maintenance requirements; audible or visual alarms.

(a) Telephones or equivalent two-way communication facilities provided at each working section shall be located not more than 500 feet outby the last open crosscut and not more than 800 feet from the farthest point of penetration of the working places on such section.

(b) The incoming communication signal shall activate an audible alarm, distinguishable from the surrounding noise level, or a visual alarm that can be seen by a miner regularly employed on the working section.

(c) If a communication system other than telephones is used and its operation depends entirely upon power from the mine electric system, means shall be provided to permit continued communication in the event the mine electric power fails or is cut off; provided, however, that where trolley phones and telephones are both used, an alternate source of power for the trolley phone system is not required.

(d) Trolley phones connected to the trolley wire shall be grounded in accordance with Subpart H of this part.

(e) Telephones or equivalent two-way communication facilities shall be maintained in good operating condition at all times. In the event of any failure in the system that results in loss of communication, repairs shall be started immediately, and the system restored to operating condition as soon as possible.
