(b) If you ask us to consult a business-information or credit-reporting service or program under § 1243.201(c), we will consult a service or program annually as long as you have active appeals and each time you appeal a new order.

(c) If our bond-approving officer determines that you are no longer financially solvent, you must post a bond or other ONRR-specified surety instrument under subpart B.
