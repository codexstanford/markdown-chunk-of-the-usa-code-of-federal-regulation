(b) Recent well test data and pressure data, if available;

(c) Maximum possible surface pressure, and how it was determined;

(d) Type and weight of well-control fluid you will use;

(e) A description of the work;

(f) A current and proposed well schematic and description that includes:

(1) Well depth;

(2) All perforated intervals that have not been plugged;

(3) Casing and tubing depths and details;

(4) Subsurface equipment;

(5) Estimated tops of cement (and the basis of the estimate) in each casing annulus;

(6) Plug locations;

(7) Plug types;

(12) Casing removal (including information on explosives, if used);

(13) Proposed casing removal depth; and

(14) Your plans to protect archaeological and sensitive biological features, including anchor damage during plugging operations, a brief assessment of the environmental impacts of the plugging operations, and the procedures and mitigation measures you will take to minimize such impacts; and

(g) Certification by a Registered Professional Engineer of the well abandonment design and procedures and that all plugs meet the requirements in the table in § 250.1715. In addition to the requirements of § 250.1715, the Registered Professional Engineer must also certify the design will include two independent barriers, one of which must be a mechanical barrier, in the center wellbore as described in § 250.420(b)(3).
