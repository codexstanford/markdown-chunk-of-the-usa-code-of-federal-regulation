####### § 585.702 What must I do if I discover a potential archaeological resource while conducting my approved activities?

(a) If you, your subcontractors, or any agent acting on your behalf discovers a potential archaeological resource while conducting construction activities, or any other activity related to your project, you must:

(1) Immediately halt all seafloor-disturbing activities within the area of the discovery;

(2) Notify BOEM of the discovery within 72 hours; and

(3) Keep the location of the discovery confidential and not take any action that may adversely affect the archaeological resource until we have made an evaluation and instructed you on how to proceed.

(b) We may require you to conduct additional investigations to determine if the resource is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under 36 CFR 60.4. We will do this if:

(1) The site has been impacted by your project activities; or

(2) Impacts to the site or to the area of potential effect cannot be avoided.

(c) If investigations under paragraph (b) of this section indicate that the resource is potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, we will tell you how to protect the resource, or how to mitigate adverse effects to the site.

(d) If we incur costs in protecting the resource, under section 110(g) of the NHPA, we may charge you reasonable costs for carrying out preservation responsibilities under the OCS Lands Act.
