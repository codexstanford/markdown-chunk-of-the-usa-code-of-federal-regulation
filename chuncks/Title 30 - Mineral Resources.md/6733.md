###### Alternate Use RUE Administration
####### § 586.213 Is an Alternate Use RUE assignable?

(a) BOEM may authorize assignment of an Alternate Use RUE.

(b) To request assignment of an Alternate Use RUE, you must submit a written request for assignment that includes the following information:

(1) BOEM-assigned Alternate Use RUE number;

(2) The names of both the assignor and the assignee, if applicable;

(3) The names and telephone numbers of the contacts for both the assignor and the assignee;

(4) The names, titles, and signatures of the authorizing officials for both the assignor and the assignee;

(5) A statement affirming that the owner of the existing OCS facility and lessee of the lease in which the facility is located approve of the proposed assignment and assignee;

(6) A statement that the assignee agrees to comply with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Alternate Use RUE;

(7) Evidence required by § 586.108 that the assignee satisfies the requirements of § 586.107; and

(8) A statement on how the assignee will comply with the financial assurance requirements set forth in the Alternate Use RUE.

(c) The assignment takes effect on the date we approve your request.

(d) The assignor is liable for all obligations that accrue under an Alternate Use RUE before the date we approve your assignment request. An assignment approval by BOEM does not relieve the assignor of liability for accrued obligations that the assignee, or a subsequent assignee, fails to perform.

(e) The assignee and each subsequent assignee are liable for all obligations that accrue under an Alternate Use RUE after the date we approve the assignment request.
