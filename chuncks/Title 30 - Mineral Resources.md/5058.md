####### § 280.25 When may BSEE require me to stop activities under this part?

(a) We may temporarily stop prospecting or scientific research activities under a permit when the Regional Director determines that:

(2) You failed to comply with any applicable law, regulation, order or provision of the permit. This would include the required submission of reports, well records or logs, and G&G data and information within the time specified; or

(3) Stopping the activities is in the interest of National security or defense.

(b) The Regional Director will advise you either orally or in writing of the procedures to temporarily stop activities. We will confirm an oral notification in writing and deliver all written notifications by courier or certified/registered mail. You must stop all activities under a permit as soon as you receive an oral or written notification.
