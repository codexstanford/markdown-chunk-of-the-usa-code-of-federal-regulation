###### § 1219.515 How will ONRR update the group of "historical lease sites" and "applicable leased tracts (Phase II)" used for determining the allocation of shared revenues?

(a) As GOMESA directs, ONRR will update the group of historical lease sites in the 2002-2007 Planning Area as follows:

(1) On December 31, 2015, we will freeze the group of historical lease sites, subject to the adjustment under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(2) Beginning January 1, 2022, and every fifth year thereafter, we will extend the ending date for determining the group of historical lease sites for an additional five calendar years by adding any new historical lease sites to the existing group.

(b) Each year we will update the group of applicable leased tracts (Phase II) to include only leases that were in effect at any time during the previous fiscal year.
