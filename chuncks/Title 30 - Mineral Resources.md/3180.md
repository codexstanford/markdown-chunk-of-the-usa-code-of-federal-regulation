###### § 75.802 Protection of high-voltage circuits extending underground.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, high-voltage circuits extending underground and supplying portable, mobile, or, stationary high-voltage equipment shall contain either a direct or derived neutral which shall be grounded through a suitable resistor at the source transformers, and a grounding circuit, originating at the grounded side of the grounding resistor, shall extend along with the power conductors and serve as a grounding conductor for the frames of all high-voltage equipment supplied power from that circuit.

(b) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary or his authorized representative may permit ungrounded high-voltage circuits to be extended underground to feed stationary electric equipment if:

(1) Such circuits are either steel armored or installed in grounded, rigid steel conduit throughout their entire length; or,

(2) The voltage of such circuits is nominally 2,400 volts or less phase-to-phase and the cables used in such circuits are equipped with metallic shields around each power conductor, and contain one or more ground conductors having a total cross sectional area of not less than one-half the power conductor; and,

(3) Upon a finding by the Secretary or his authorized representative that the use of the circuits described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section does not pose a hazard to the miners.

(c) Within 100 feet of the point on the surface where high-voltage circuits enter the underground portion of the mine, disconnecting devices shall be installed and so equipped or designed in such a manner that it can be determined by visual observation that the power is disconnected, except that the Secretary or his authorized representative may permit such devices to be installed at a greater distance from such area of the mine if he determines, based on existing physical conditions, that such installation will be more accessible at a greater distance and will not pose any hazard to the miners.
