###### § 581.42 Effect of assignment on particular lease.

(a) When an assignment is made of all the record title to a portion of the acreage in a lease, the assigned and retained portions of the lease area become segregated into separate and distinct leases. In such a case, the assignee becomes a lessee of the Government as to the segregated tract that is the subject of the assignment and is bound by the terms of the lease as though the lease had been obtained from the United States in the assignee's own name, and the assignment, after its approval, shall be the basis of a new record. Royalty, minimum royalty, and annual rental provisions of the lease shall apply separately to each segregated portion.

(b) Each lease of an OCS mineral created by the segregation of a lease under paragraph (a) of this section shall continue in full force and effect for the remainder of the primary term of the original lease and so long thereafter as minerals are produced from the portion of the lease created by segregation in accordance with operations approved by the Director or the lessee is otherwise in compliance with provisions of the lease or regulations for earning the continuation of the lease in effect.
