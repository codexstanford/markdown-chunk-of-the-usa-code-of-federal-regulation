Flat surfaces between bolt holes that form any part of a flame-arresting path shall be plane to within a maximum deviation of one-half the maximum clearance specified in § 18.31(a)(6). All metal surfaces forming a flame-arresting path shall be finished during the manufacturing process to not more than 250 microinches. A thin film of nonhardening preparation to inhibit rusting may be applied to these finished metal surfaces as long as the final surface can be readily wiped free of any foreign materials.
