(f) Any person who obtains a qualification number from BOEM is responsible to ensure that it is not using the qualification number approved by BOEM for any purpose that its operating rules do not allow.

(g) Any evidence submitted in response to paragraphs (c), (d), or (e) of this section is submitted subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001.

(h) A person may not hold leases on the OCS until the evidence requested in this section has been accepted and approved by BOEM and BOEM has issued a qualification number to that person.
