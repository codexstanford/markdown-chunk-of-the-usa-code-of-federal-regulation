####### § 250.854 Floating production units equipped with turrets and turret-mounted systems.
######## etc.

(a) For floating production units equipped with an auto slew system, you must integrate the auto slew control system with your process safety system allowing for automatic shut-in of the production process, including the sources (subsea wells, subsea pumps,) and releasing of the buoy. Your safety system must immediately initiate a process system shut-in according to §§ 250.838 and 250.839 and release the buoy to prevent hydrocarbon discharge and damage to the subsea infrastructure when the following are encountered:

(1) Your buoy is clamped,

(2) Your auto slew mode is activated, and

(3) You encounter a ship heading/position failure or an exceedance of the rotational tolerances of the clamped buoy.

(b) For floating production units equipped with swivel stack arrangements, you must equip the portion of the swivel stack containing hydrocarbons with a leak detection system. Your leak detection system must be tied into your production process surface safety system allowing for automatic shut-in of the system. Upon seal system failure and detection of a hydrocarbon leak, your surface safety system must immediately initiate a process system shut-in according to §§ 250.838 and 250.839.
