###### § 1202.551 How do I determine the volume of production for which I must pay royalty if my lease is not in an approved Federal unit or communitization agreement (AFA)?

(a) You are liable for royalty on your entitled share of gas production from your Indian lease, except as provided in §§ 1202.555, 1202.556, and 1202.557.

(b) You and all other persons paying royalties on the lease must report and pay royalties based on your takes. If another person takes some of your entitled share but does not pay the royalties owed, you are liable for those royalties.

(c) You and all other persons paying royalties on the lease may ask ONRR for permission to report and pay royalties based on your entitlements. In that event, ONRR will provide valuation instructions consistent with this part and part 1206 of this title.
