(a) Whenever the owner of a nonproducing lease fails to comply with any of the provisions of the Act, the lease, or the regulations issued under the Act, and the default continues for a period of 30 days after mailing of notice by registered or certified letter to the lease owner at the owner's record post office address, the Secretary may cancel the lease pursuant to section 5(c) of the Act, and the lessee shall not be entitled to compensation. Any such cancellation is subject to judicial review as provided by section 23(b) of the Act.

(d) The Secretary may cancel a lease in accordance with the following:

(1) Cancellation may occur at any time if the Secretary determines after a hearing that:

(ii) The excess, if any, over the lessee's revenue from the lease (plus interest thereon from the date of receipt to date of reimbursement) of all consideration paid for the lease and all direct expenditures made by the lessee after the date of issuance of such lease and in connection with exploration or development, or both, pursuant to the lease (plus interest on such consideration and such expenditures from date of payment to date of reimbursement), except that in the case of joint leases which are canceled due to the failure of one or more partners to exercise due diligence, the innocent parties shall have the right to seek damages for such loss from the responsible party or parties and the right to acquire the interests of the negligent party or parties and be issued the lease in question.

(iii) The lessee shall not be entitled to compensation where one of the following circumstances exists when a lease is canceled:

(A) A producing lease is forfeited or is canceled pursuant to section (5)(d) of the Act;
