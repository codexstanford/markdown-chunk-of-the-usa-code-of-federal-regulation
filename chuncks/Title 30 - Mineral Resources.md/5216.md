###### Decommissioning Applications
####### § 285.907 How will BSEE process my decommissioning application?

(a) Based upon your inclusion of all the information required by § 285.906, BSEE will compare your decommissioning application with the decommissioning general concept in your approved SAP, COP, or GAP to determine what technical and environmental reviews are needed.

(b) You will likely have to revise your SAP, COP, or GAP, and BOEM will begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and other regulatory reviews as required, if BSEE determines that your decommissioning application would:

(1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated in your SAP, COP, or GAP;

(2) Require any additional Federal permits; or

(3) Propose activities not previously identified and evaluated in your SAP, COP, or GAP.

(c) During the review process, we may request additional information if we determine that the information provided is not sufficient to complete the review and approval process.

(d) Upon completion of the technical and environmental reviews, we may approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove your decommissioning application.

(e) If BSEE disapproves your decommissioning application, you must resubmit your application to address the concerns identified by BSEE.
