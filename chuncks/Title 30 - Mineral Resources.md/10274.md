###### § 1228.108 Deduction of civil penalties accruing to the State or tribe from the Federal share of a cooperative agreement.

As provided at 30 U.S.C. 1736, 50 percent of any civil penalty collected as a result of activities under a cooperative agreement will be shared with the State or Indian tribe performing the cooperative agreement; however, the amount of the civil penalty shared will be deducted from any Federal funding owed under that cooperative agreement. ONRR shall maintain records of civil penalties collected and distributed to the States and tribes involved in cooperative agreements. Each quarterly payment of the Federal share of a cooperative agreement will be reduced by the amount of the civil penalties paid to the State or tribe during the prior quarter.
