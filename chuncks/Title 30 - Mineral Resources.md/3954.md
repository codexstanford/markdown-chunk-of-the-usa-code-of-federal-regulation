###### Royalty Relief for Drilling Ultra-Deep Wells on Leases Not Subject to Deep Water Royalty Relief
####### § 203.32 What other requirements or restrictions apply to royalty relief for a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?

(a) If a qualified ultra-deep well on your lease is within a unitized portion of your lease, the RSV earned by that well under this section applies only to your lease and not to other leases within the unit or to the unit as a whole.

(b) If your qualified ultra-deep well is a directional well (either an original well or a sidetrack) drilled across a lease line, then either:

(1) The lease with the perforated interval that initially produces earns the RSV or

(2) If the perforated interval crosses a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the RSV.

(c) Any RSV earned under § 203.31 is in addition to any royalty suspension supplement (RSS) for your lease under § 203.45 that results from a different wellbore.

(d) If your lease earns an RSV under § 203.31 and later produces from a deep well that is not a qualified well, the RSV is not forfeited or terminated, but you may not apply the RSV earned under § 203.31 to production from the non-qualified well.

(e) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms notwithstanding any RSVs allowed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 203.31.

(f) Unused RSVs transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.
