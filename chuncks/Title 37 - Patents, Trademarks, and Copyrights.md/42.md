####### § 1.10 Filing of correspondence by Priority Mail Express&#xAE;.

(a)(1) Any correspondence received by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that was delivered by the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; Post Office to Addressee service of the United States Postal Service (USPS) will be considered filed with the USPTO on the date of deposit with the USPS.

(2) The date of deposit with USPS is shown by the "date accepted" on the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; label or other official USPS notation. If the USPS deposit date cannot be determined, the correspondence will be accorded the USPTO receipt date as the filing date. See § 1.6(a).

(b) Correspondence should be deposited directly with an employee of the USPS to ensure that the person depositing the correspondence receives a legible copy of the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label with the "date accepted" clearly marked. Persons dealing indirectly with the employees of the USPS (such as by deposit in a Priority Mail Express&#xAE; drop box) do so at the risk of not receiving a copy of the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label with the desired "date accepted" clearly marked. The paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence should also include the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label number thereon. See paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this section.

(c) Any person filing correspondence under this section that was received by the Office and delivered by the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; Post Office to Addressee service of the USPS, who can show that there is a discrepancy between the filing date accorded by the Office to the correspondence and the date of deposit as shown by the "date accepted" on the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label or other official USPS notation, may petition the Director to accord the correspondence a filing date as of the "date accepted" on the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label or other official USPS notation, provided that:

(1) The petition is filed promptly after the person becomes aware that the Office has accorded, or will accord, a filing date other than the USPS deposit date;

(2) The number of the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label was placed on the paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence prior to the original mailing by Priority Mail Express&#xAE;; and

(3) The petition includes a true copy of the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label showing the "date accepted," and of any other official notation by the USPS relied upon to show the date of deposit.

(d) Any person filing correspondence under this section that was received by the Office and delivered by the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; Post Office to Addressee service of the USPS, who can show that the "date accepted" on the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label or other official notation entered by the USPS was incorrectly entered or omitted by the USPS, may petition the Director to accord the correspondence a filing date as of the date the correspondence is shown to have been deposited with the USPS, provided that:

(1) The petition is filed promptly after the person becomes aware that the Office has accorded, or will accord, a filing date based upon an incorrect entry by the USPS;

(2) The number of the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label was placed on the paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence prior to the original mailing by Priority Mail Express&#xAE;; and

(4) The petition includes a statement which establishes, to the satisfaction of the Director, the original deposit of the correspondence and that the copies of the correspondence, the copy of the Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label, the copy of any returned postcard receipt, and any official notation entered by the USPS are true copies of the originally mailed correspondence, original Priority Mail Express&#xAE; mailing label, returned postcard receipt, and official notation entered by the USPS.
