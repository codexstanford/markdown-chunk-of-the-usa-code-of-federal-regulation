If the applicant submits substitute specimen(s), the applicant must:

(1) For an amendment to allege use under § 2.76, submit a verified statement that the substitute specimen(s) was in use in commerce prior to filing the amendment to allege use.

(2) For a statement of use under § 2.88, submit a verified statement that the substitute specimen(s) was in use in commerce either prior to filing the statement of use or prior to the expiration of the deadline for filing the statement of use.
