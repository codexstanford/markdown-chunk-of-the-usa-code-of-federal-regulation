####### § 1.477 Protest to lack of unity of invention before the International Searching Authority.

(a) If the applicant disagrees with the holding of lack of unity of invention by the International Searching Authority, additional fees may be paid under protest, accompanied by a request for refund and a statement setting forth reasons for disagreement or why the required additional fees are considered excessive, or both (PCT Rule 40.2(c)).

(b) Protest under paragraph (a) of this section will be examined by the Director or the Director's designee. In the event that the applicant's protest is determined to be justified, the additional fees or a portion thereof will be refunded.

Thereafter, such notification should be directed to the International Bureau (PCT Rule 40.2(c)).
