(b) The purpose of this subpart is:

(1) To conserve the time of Office employees for conducting official business;

(2) To minimize the possibility of involving the Office in the matters of private parties or other issues which are not related to the mission of the Office;

(3) To prevent the public from confusing personal opinions of Office employees with Office policy;

(4) To avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes;

(5) To preserve the integrity of the administrative process, minimize disruption of the decision-making process, and prevent interference with the Office's administrative functions.

(c) An employee of the Office may not voluntarily appear as a witness or voluntarily testify in a legal proceeding relating to his or her official capacity without proper authorization under this subpart.

(d) This subpart does not apply to any legal proceeding in which:

(1) An employee is to testify regarding facts or events that are unrelated to official business; or

(2) A former employee is asked to testify as an expert on a matter in which that employee did not personally participate while at the Office so long as the former employee testifies concerning his or her personal opinion and does not purport to speak for or on behalf of the Copyright Office.
