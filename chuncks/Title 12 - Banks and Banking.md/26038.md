##### § 366.11 Will the FDIC waive a conflict of interest?

(a) We may waive a conflict of interest for good cause shown at our discretion when our need to contract for your services outweighs all relevant factors.

(b) The following are examples of when we may grant you a waiver for a conflict of interest. These examples are not inclusive.

(1) We may grant a waiver to an outside counsel who has a representational conflict. We will weigh all relevant facts and circumstances in making our determination.

(2) We may grant a waiver to allow a contractor to acquire an asset from us who is providing or has provided services on that asset. We will consider whether granting the waiver will adversely affect the fairness of the sale, the type of services provided, and other facts and circumstances relevant to the sale in making our determination.
