(d) The Director may reduce a goal or subgoal pursuant to a petition for reduction only if:

(1) Market and economic conditions or the financial condition of the Enterprise require such a reduction; or

(2) Efforts to meet the goal or subgoal would result in the constraint of liquidity, over-investment in certain market segments, or other consequences contrary to the intent of the Safety and Soundness Act or the purposes of the Charter Acts (12 U.S.C. 1716; 12 U.S.C. 1451 note).
