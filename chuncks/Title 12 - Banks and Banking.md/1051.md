#### Subpart H - Establishment of Minimum Capital Ratios for an Individual Bank or Individual Federal Savings Association
##### § 3.403 Standards for determination of appropriate individual minimum capital ratios.

The appropriate minimum capital ratios for an individual national bank or Federal savings association cannot be determined solely through the application of a rigid mathematical formula or wholly objective criteria. The decision is necessarily based in part on subjective judgment grounded in agency expertise. The factors to be considered in the determination will vary in each case and may include, for example:

(a) The conditions or circumstances leading to the OCC's determination that higher minimum capital ratios are appropriate or necessary for the national bank or Federal savings association;

(b) The exigency of those circumstances or potential problems;

(c) The overall condition, management strength, and future prospects of the national bank or Federal savings association and, if applicable, its holding company and/or affiliate(s);

(d) The national bank's or Federal savings association's liquidity, capital, risk asset and other ratios compared to the ratios of its peer group; and

(e) The views of the national bank's or Federal savings association's directors and senior management.
