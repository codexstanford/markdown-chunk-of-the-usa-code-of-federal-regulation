Any Federal agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the Bureau be administratively offset by the Bureau in order to collect a debt owed to such agency by the debtor. The Director shall initiate the requested offset only upon:

(a) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency stating:

(2) The amount and basis of the debt; and

(3) That the creditor agency has fully complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716; and

(b) A determination that collection by offset against funds payable by the Bureau would be in the best interest of the United States and that such offset would not be contrary to law.
