(a)(1) A covered swap entity shall calculate on each business day an initial margin collection amount for each counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user with a material swaps exposure and an affiliate of the covered swap entity.

(2) If the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not exceed 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital, the requirements for a covered swap entity to collect initial margin under § 624.3(a) do not apply with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a counterparty that is an affiliate.

(3) On each business day that the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section exceeds 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital:

(i) The covered swap entity shall collect initial margin under § 624.3(a) for each additional non-cleared swap and non-cleared security-based swap executed that business day with a counterparty that is a swap entity or financial end user with a material swaps exposure and an affiliate of the covered swap entity, commencing on the day after execution and continuing on a daily basis as required under § 624.3(c), until the earlier of;

(B) The business day on which the aggregate of all initial margin collection amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section falls below 15 percent of the covered swap entity's tier 1 capital;

(ii) Notwithstanding § 624.7(b), to the extent the covered swap entity collects initial margin pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section in the form of collateral other than cash collateral, the custodian for such collateral may be the covered swap entity or an affiliate of the covered swap entity; and

(4) For purposes of this paragraph (a), "tier 1 capital" means:

(i) For Farm Credit System banks and associations, the sum of common equity tier 1 capital as defined in 12 CFR 628.20(b) and additional tier 1 capital as defined in 12 CFR 628.20(c), and as reported in the institution's most recent Uniform Reports of Financial Condition and Performance (Call Report); or

(i) The covered swap entity shall treat such non-cleared swap or security-based swap as its own for purposes of this paragraph (a); and

(ii) If the subsidiary is itself a covered swap entity, the compliance by its parent covered swap entity with this paragraph (a)(5) shall be deemed to establish the subsidiary's compliance with the requirements of § 624.11(a) and to exempt the subsidiary from the requirements for a covered swap entity to collect initial margin under § 624.3(a) from an affiliate.

(b) The requirement for a covered swap entity to post initial margin under § 624.3(b) does not apply with respect to any non-cleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with a counterparty that is an affiliate.
