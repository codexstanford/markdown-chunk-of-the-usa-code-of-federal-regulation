###### § 313.184 Collection of civil money penalty debt.

(a) The FDIC will follow Department of Treasury regulations set forth at 31 CFR part 285, as applicable and consistent with this subpart, for the collection of civil money penalty debt, including centralized offset of Federal payments to collect non-tax debts that may be owed to the FDIC, under 31 CFR 285.5.

(b) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to require the FDIC to provide duplicate notice or other procedural protections that have already been provided or afforded to a civil money penalty debtor in the course of administrative or judicial litigation or otherwise.

(c) For civil money penalty debtors, and for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 3716(b)(1), the FDIC adopts without change the regulations on collection by administrative offset set forth at 31 CFR 901.3 and other relevant sections of the Federal Claims Collection Standards applicable to such offset, to the extent those regulations are consistent with this subpart.

(d) Nothing in this subpart precludes the collection of debts through any other available means or precludes the FDIC from engaging in litigation or the compromise of debt as provided under 12 U.S.C. 1818(i) or any other applicable law or regulation.
