###### § 747.403 Notice of intent to suspend or revoke charter; notice of suspension.

(a) Upon its determination that one or more of the grounds listed in § 747.402(a) exists, or that because of conditions described in § 747.402(b) immediate suspension of charter is necessary, the NCUA Board shall cause to be served upon that credit union a notice of intent to suspend or revoke charter and of intent to place into involuntary liquidation, or a notice of suspension. Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts which constitute the grounds for this action, a recitation of the options available to the credit union under paragraph (b) of this section, and an explanation of the results that will occur if the credit union fails to exercise said options.

(b) Not later than 40 days after the receipt of the notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal credit union may file with the NCUA Board a statement in writing setting forth the grounds and reasons why its charter should not be suspended or revoked and why it should not be placed into involuntary liquidation; or in lieu of a written statement, request an oral hearing which shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart. This statement or request shall be accompanied by a certified copy of a resolution of the board of directors of the Federal credit union concerned authorizing such statement or request, such certification to be made by the president and secretary of the board of directors.

(c) If the Federal credit union concerned does not exercise either alternative available in paragraph (b) of this section within the time required, it shall be deemed to have admitted the facts alleged in the notice and may be deemed to have consented to the relief sought.
