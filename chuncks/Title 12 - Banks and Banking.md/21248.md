###### § 304.14 Reservation of authority.

Notwithstanding § 304.13, the Corporation, in consultation with the applicable state chartering authority, may require an otherwise eligible covered depository institution to file the FFIEC 041 version of the report of condition, or any successor thereto, based on an institution-specific determination. In making this determination, the Corporation may consider criteria including, but not limited to, whether the institution is significantly engaged in one or more complex, specialized, or other higher-risk activities, such as those for which limited information is reported in the FFIEC 051 version of the report of condition compared to the FFIEC 041 version of the report of condition. Nothing in this part shall be construed to limit the Corporation's authority to obtain information from insured depository institutions.
