(ii) That the equity is retireable only at the discretion of the board of directors consistent with the institution's bylaws and only if minimum capital standards established under subpart H of this part and part 628 of this chapter are met and that such retirement may also require the approval of the FCA;

(iii) Whether the institution presently meets its minimum capital standards established under subpart H of this part and part 628 of this chapter;
