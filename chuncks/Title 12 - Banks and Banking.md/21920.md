(a) To request a hearing, an employee must send a written request to the Director. The request must be received by the Director within 30 calendar days after the employee's receipt of the Notice of Intent.

(b) The request must be signed by the employee and must fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all the facts, evidence, and witnesses, if any, that the employee believes support his or her position. The request for hearing must state whether the employee is requesting an oral or documentary hearing.
