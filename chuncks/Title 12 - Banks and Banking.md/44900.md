###### § 1227.1 Purpose.

This part sets forth the procedures FHFA follows under its Suspended Counterparty Program, the purpose of which is to protect the safety and soundness of the regulated entities. The procedures require the regulated entities to submit reports when they become aware that a person with whom they have engaged or are engaging in a covered transaction within the past three (3) years has engaged in covered misconduct. The procedures set forth a process for FHFA to issue suspension orders directing the regulated entities to cease or refrain from engaging in covered transactions with such persons and any affiliates thereof for a specified period of time or permanently. A suspension order is not intended to be, and may not be issued as, a form of punishment for the suspended person. The procedures include options for:

(a) Appeal of a final suspension order to the Director;

(b) Request for reconsideration of a final suspension order after twelve (12) months have elapsed; and

(c) Request for an exception to a final suspension order in effect in order to engage in a particular covered transaction with the suspended person.
