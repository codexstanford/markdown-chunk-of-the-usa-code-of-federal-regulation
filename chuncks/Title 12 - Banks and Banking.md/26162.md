A covered institution's IT system should be able to produce a file in the format below that can be used to calculate deposit insurance coverage for deposits resulting from credit balances on accounts for debt owed to the covered institution ("credit balances"). This file format is derived from the "Broker Submission File Format" found in the FDIC's "Deposit Broker's Processing Guide," supplemented by the "Addendum to the Deposit Broker's Processing Guide" used for Part 370 alternative recordkeeping entity processing. The file format below identifies fields that are not applicable for processing credit balances. These fields should be null while also maintaining the pipe delimiters. Additional information regarding the FDIC's Deposit Broker's Processing Guide for part 370 covered institutions may be found at
