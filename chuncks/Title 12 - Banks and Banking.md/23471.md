###### Appendix B to Subpart A of Part 327 - Conversion of Scorecard Measures into Score

Weighted average CAMELS ratings between 1 and 3.5 are assigned a score between 25 and 100 according to the following equation:

For certain scorecard measures, a lower ratio implies lower risk and a higher ratio implies higher risk. These measures include:

- Concentration measure;

- Credit quality measure;

- Market risk measure;

- Average short-term funding to average total assets ratio; and

- Potential losses to total domestic deposits ratio (loss severity measure).

For those measures, a value between the minimum and maximum cutoff values is converted linearly to a score between 0 and 100, according to the following formula:

- Leverage ratio;

- Core earnings to average quarter-end total assets ratio;

- Core deposits to total liabilities ratio; and

- Balance sheet liquidity ratio.

For those measures, a value between the minimum and maximum cutoff values is converted linearly to a score between 0 and 100, according to the following formula:
