###### § 238.23 Rebuttable presumption of noncontrol of a company.

(a) In any proceeding under § 238.21(b) or (c) of this part, a first company is presumed not to control a second company if:

(1) The first company controls less than 10 percent of the outstanding securities of each class of voting securities of the second company; and

(2) The first company is not presumed to control the second company under § 238.22 of this part.

(b) In any proceeding under this subpart, or judicial proceeding under the Home Owners' Loan Act, other than a proceeding in which the Board has made a preliminary determination that a first company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a second company, a first company may not be held to have had control over a second company at any given time, unless the first company, at the time in question, controlled 5 percent or more of the outstanding securities of any class of voting securities of the second company, or had already been found to have control on the basis of the existence of a controlling influence relationship.
