(b) The withholding order sent to the employer will be in the form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, on the FDIC's letterhead, and signed by the head of the agency or delegate. The order will contain all information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order, including the debtor's name, address, and social security number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where payments should be sent.

(c) The FDIC will keep a stamped copy of the order indicating the date it was mailed.
