#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Renewal provisions.

2.If, under the credit agreement, a creditor retains the right to review a line at the end of the specified draw period and determine whether to renew or extend the draw period of the plan, the possibility of renewal or extension-regardless of its likelihood-should be ignored for purposes of the disclosures. For example, if an agreement provides that the draw period is five years and that the creditor may renew the draw period for an additional five years, the possibility of renewal should be ignored and the draw period should be considered five years. (See the commentary accompanying § 1026.9(c)(1) dealing with change in terms requirements.)
