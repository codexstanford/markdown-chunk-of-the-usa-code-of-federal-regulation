###### § 308.163 Notice of suspension or prohibition, and orders of removal or prohibition.

(a) Notice of suspension or prohibition.

(1) The Board of Directors or its designee may suspend or prohibit from further participation in the conduct of the affairs of any depository institution an institution-affiliated party by written notice of suspension or prohibition upon a determination by the Board of Directors or its designee that the grounds for such suspension or prohibition exist. The written notice of suspension or prohibition shall be served upon the institution-affiliated party and any depository institution that the subject of the action is affiliated with at the time the notice is issued.

(2) The suspension or prohibition shall be effective immediately upon service on the institution-affiliated party, who shall immediately comply with the requirements thereof, and shall remain in effect until final disposition of the information, indictment, complaint, or until it is terminated by the Board of Directors or its designee under the provisions of § 308.164 or otherwise.

(b) Order of removal or prohibition.

(1) The Board of Directors or its designee may issue an order removing or prohibiting from further participation in the conduct of the affairs of any depository institution an institution-affiliated party, when a final judgment of conviction not subject to further appellate review is entered against the institution-affiliated party for a crime referred to in § 308.161(a)(1) and continued service or participation by such party posed, poses, or may pose a threat to the interests of the depositors of, or threatened, threatens, or may threaten to impair public confidence in, any relevant depository institution (as defined at section 1818(g)(1)(E) of title 12).

(2) An order of removal or prohibition shall be entered if a judgment of conviction is entered against the institution-affiliated party for a crime described in § 308.161(a)(2).

(c) The notice of suspension or prohibition or the order of removal or prohibition shall:

(1) Inform the institution-affiliated party that a written request for a hearing, stating the relief desired and grounds therefore, and any supporting evidence, may be filed with the Administrative Officer within 30 days after service of the written notice or order; and

(2) Set forth the basis and facts in support of the notice or order and address the relevant considerations specified in § 308.162.

(d) To obtain a hearing, the institution-affiliated party shall file with the Administrative Officer a written request for a hearing within 30 days after service of the notice of suspension or prohibition or the order of removal or prohibition, which shall:

(1) Admit or deny specifically each allegation in the notice or order, or state that the institution-affiliated party is without knowledge or information, which statement shall have the effect of a denial. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed to be admitted. When an institution-affiliated party intends in good faith to deny only a part of or to qualify an allegation, he shall specify so much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder; and

(2) Shall state whether the institution-affiliated party is requesting termination or modification of the notice or order, and shall state with particularity how he intends to show that his continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the depository institution would not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interests of its depositors or to impair public confidence in the depository institution.
