##### § 3.501 Remedies.

A national bank or Federal savings association that does not have or maintain the minimum capital ratios applicable to it, whether required in subpart B of this part, in a decision pursuant to subpart H of this part, in a written agreement or temporary or final order under 12 U.S.C. 1818 (b) or (c), or in a condition for approval of an application, or a national bank or Federal savings association that has failed to submit or comply with an acceptable plan to attain those ratios, will be subject to such administrative action or sanctions as the OCC considers appropriate. These sanctions may include the issuance of a Directive pursuant to subpart J of this part or other enforcement action, assessment of civil money penalties, and/or the denial, conditioning, or revocation of applications. A national bank's or Federal savings association's failure to achieve or maintain minimum capital ratios in subpart B of this part may also be the basis for an action by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to terminate Federal deposit insurance. See 12 CFR part 308, subpart F.
