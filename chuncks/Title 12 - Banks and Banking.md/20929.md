###### § 303.46 Financial education programs that include the provision of bank products and services.

No branch application or prior approval is required in order for a state nonmember bank to participate in one or more financial education programs that involve receiving deposits, paying withdrawals, or lending money if:

(a) Such service or services are provided on school premises, or a facility used by the school;

(b) Such service or services are provided at the discretion of the school;

(c) The principal purpose of each program is financial education. For example, the principal purpose of a program would be considered to be financial education if the program is designed to teach students the principles of personal financial management, banking operations, or the benefits of saving for the future, and is not designed for the purpose of profit-making; and

(d) Each program is conducted in a manner that is consistent with safe and sound banking practices and complies with applicable law.
