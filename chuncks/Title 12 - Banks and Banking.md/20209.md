##### § 264b.4 Gifts of minimal value.

(a) Board employees may accept and retain a gift of minimal value tendered and received as a souvenir or mark of courtesy. If more than one tangible gift is presented at or marks an event, the value of all such gifts must not exceed "minimal value." If tangible gifts are presented at or mark separate events, their value must not exceed "minimal value" for each event, but may exceed "minimal value" for all events, even if the events occur on the same day.

(b) Board employees may determine at the time a gift is offered whether it is of minimal value, or they may submit an accepted gift as soon as practicable to the Office of the Secretary for valuation.

(c) Disagreements over whether a gift is of minimal value will be resolved by an independent appraisal under procedures established by the Office of the Secretary.
