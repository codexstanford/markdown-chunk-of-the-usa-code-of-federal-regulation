(b) The member shall have complied with all Commodity Credit Corporation eligibility requirements.

(c) The loan shall mature not later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the period during which the Commodity Credit Corporation loan or other price support may be obtained on the commodity and shall be secured by pledge of negotiable warehouse receipts covering the commodity.

(d) The borrower shall appoint the association as his attorney-in-fact to obtain a Commodity Credit Corporation loan (or other such price support as is available) in the event that the borrower fails to do so prior to maturity or repayment of the loan.
