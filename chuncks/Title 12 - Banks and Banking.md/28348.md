(b) Farmer Mac, either in its own name or through an affiliate controlled or owned by Farmer Mac, is authorized by section 8.6 of the Act:

(1) To issue and/or guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest on securities representing interests in or obligations backed by pools of agricultural real estate loans (guaranteed securities); and

(2) To issue debt obligations (which, together with the guaranteed securities described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are referred to as Farmer Mac securities). Farmer Mac may prescribe the forms, the denominations, the rates of interest, the conditions, the manner of issuance, and the prices of Farmer Mac securities.

(c) Farmer Mac securities shall be governed by §§ 615.5450, and 615.5452 through 615.5460. In interpreting those sections for purposes of this subpart, unless the context requires otherwise, the term "Farmer Mac securities" shall be read for "Farm Credit securities," and "Farmer Mac" shall be read for "Farm Credit banks" and "Funding Corporation." These terms shall be read as though modified where necessary to effectuate the application of the designated sections of subpart O of this part to Farmer Mac.
