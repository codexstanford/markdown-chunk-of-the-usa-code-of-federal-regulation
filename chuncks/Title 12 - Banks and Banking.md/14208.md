###### Conditions for redisclosure.

1.If, at the time of consummation, the annual percentage rate disclosed is accurate under § 226.22, the creditor does not have to make corrected disclosures under § 226.19(a)(2). If, on the other hand, the annual percentage rate disclosed is not accurate under § 226.22, the creditor must make corrected disclosures of all changed terms (including the annual percentage rate) so that the consumer receives them not later than the third business day before consummation. For example, assume consummation is scheduled for Thursday, June 11 and the early disclosures for a regular mortgage transaction disclose an annual percentage rate of 7.00%:

i. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.10%. The creditor is not required to make corrected disclosures under § 226.19(a)(2).

ii. On Thursday, June 11, the annual percentage rate will be 7.15%. The creditor must make corrected disclosures so that the consumer receives them on or before Monday, June 8.
