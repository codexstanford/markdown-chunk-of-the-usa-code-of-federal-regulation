###### Alternative plans for covering overdrafts.,overdraft protection plans,

5.If the institution offers both a line of credit subject to the Board's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226) and a service that transfers funds from another account of the consumer held at the institution to cover overdrafts, the institution must state in its opt-in notice that both alternative plans are offered. For example, the notice might state "We also offersuch as a link to a savings account or to an overdraft line of credit, which may be less expensive than our standard overdraft practices." If the institution offers one, but not the other, it must state in its opt-in notice the alternative plan that it offers. If the institution does not offer either plan, it should omit the reference to the alternative plans.
