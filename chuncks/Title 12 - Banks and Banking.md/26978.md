(b) If any amendment is filed prior to the effective date, the offering circular shall be deemed to have been filed when such amendment was filed.

(c) The period until automatic effectiveness under this subpart shall be stated at the bottom of the facing page of the Form OC or any amendment.

(d) The effectiveness will be delayed if a duly authorized amendment, telegram confirmed in writing, or letter states that the effective date is delayed until a further amendment is filed specifically stating that the offering circular will become effective in accordance with this subpart.

(e) An amendment filed after the effective date of the offering circular shall become effective on such date as the FDIC may determine.

(f) If it appears to the FDIC at any time that the offering circular includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, then the FDIC may pursue any remedy it is authorized to pursue under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1818), including, but not limited to, institution of cease-and-desist proceedings.
