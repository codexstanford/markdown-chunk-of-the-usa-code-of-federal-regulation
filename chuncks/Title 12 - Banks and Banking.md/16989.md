(h) Provide that the Reorganization Plan as adopted by the boards of directors of the reorganizing association and any acquiree association may be substantively amended by those boards of directors as a result of comments from regulatory authorities or otherwise prior to the solicitation of proxies from the members of the reorganizing association and any acquiree association to vote on the Reorganization Plan and at any time thereafter with the concurrence of the Board; and that the reorganization may be terminated by the board of directors of the reorganizing association or any acquiree association at any time prior to the meeting of the members of the association called to consider the Reorganization Plan and at any time thereafter with the concurrence of the Board;

(i) Provide that the Reorganization Plan shall be terminated if not completed within a specified period of time (The time period shall not be more than 24 months from the date upon which the members of the reorganizing association or the date upon which the members of any acquiree association, whichever is earlier, approve the Reorganization Plan and may not be extended by the reorganizing or acquiree association); and
