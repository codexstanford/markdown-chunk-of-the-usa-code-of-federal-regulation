### PART 169 - PROXIES
#### § 169.2 Form of proxies.

Every form of proxy shall conform to the following requirements:

(a) The proxy shall be revocable at will by the person giving it. The power to revoke may not be conditioned on any event or occurrence or be otherwise limited; except that, in the case of a proxy relating to capital stock if such proxy is coupled with an interest, states such fact on its face, and is valid under the laws of the state in which it is to be exercised, such proxy may be made irrevocable to the extent permitted by such state law.

(b) The proxy may not be part of any other document or instrument (such as an account card).

(c) The proxy shall be clearly labeled "Revocable Proxy" in boldface type (at least as large as 18 point).
