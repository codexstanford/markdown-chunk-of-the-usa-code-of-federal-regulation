#### § 16.15 Form and content.

(a) Any registration statement filed pursuant to this part must be on the form for registration (17 CFR part 239) that the national bank or Federal savings association would be eligible to use were it required to register the securities under the Securities Act and must meet the requirements of the SEC regulations referred to in the applicable form for registration. A filer should consult the SEC's Securities Act Industry Guide 3-Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (17 CFR 229.801(c) and 231) for guidance on appropriate disclosures when preparing registration statements.

(b) Any registration statement or amendment filed pursuant to this part must comply with the requirements of SEC Regulation C (17 CFR part 230, Regulation C-Registration), except to the extent those requirements conflict with specific requirements of this part.

(c) In addition to the information expressly required to be included in the registration statement by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the registration statement must include any additional material information that is necessary to make the required statements, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the registration statement for securities issued by a national bank or Federal savings association that is not in compliance with the regulatory capital requirements set forth in 12 CFR part 3, as applicable must be on the Form S-1 (17 CFR part 239) registration statement under the Securities Act.

(e) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a national bank or Federal savings association in organization pursuant to § 5.20 of this chapter shall not be required to include audited financial statements as part of its registration statement for the offer and sale of its securities, or as part of its offering statement for the offer and sale of its securities pursuant to 12 CFR 16.8, unless the OCC determines that factors particular to the proposal indicate that inclusion of such statements would be in the interest of investors or would further the safe and sound operation of a national bank or Federal savings association.
