### PART 1815 - ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
#### § 1815.110 Categorical exclusion.

The CEQ regulations provide for the categorical exclusion of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment (40 CFR 1508.4). Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an EIS is required for such actions. An action which falls into one of the categories below may still require the preparation of an EIS or environmental assessment if the designated Fund official determines it meets the criteria stated in § 1815.109 or involves extraordinary circumstances that may have a significant environmental effect. The Fund has determined the following categorical exclusions:

(b) Actions directly related to and implementing proposals for which an environmental assessment or an environmental assessment and EIS have been prepared;
