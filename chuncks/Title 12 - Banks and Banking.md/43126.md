## Chapter X—Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection
### PART 1073-PROCEDURES FOR BUREAU DEBT COLLECTION
#### Subpart C-Salary Offset
##### § 1073.301 Scope.

(a) These salary offset regulations should be read in conjunction with 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and apply to the collection of debts owed by employees of the Bureau or other Federal agencies.

(b) These salary offset procedures do not apply:

(1) Where an employee consents to the recovery of a debt from his current pay account;

(2) To debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, U.S. Code), the tariff laws of the United States, or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.

(c) These procedures do not preclude an employee from requesting a waiver of an erroneous payment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, or from questioning the amount or validity of a debt, in the manner specified by law or these agency regulations. This subpart also does not preclude an employee from requesting waiver of the collection of a debt under any other applicable statutory authority.

(d) When possible, salary offset through centralized administrative offset procedures should be attempted before seeking salary offset from a paying agency different than the creditor agency.
