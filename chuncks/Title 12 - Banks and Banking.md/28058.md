###### § 614.4357 Banks for cooperatives look-through notes.

Where a bank for cooperatives makes a loan to an eligible borrower that is secured by notes of individuals or business entities, the basic lending limits provided in § 614.4355 may be applied to each original notemaker rather than to the loan to the eligible borrower, if:

(a) Each note is current and carries a full recourse endorsement or unconditional guarantee by the borrower;

(b) The bank determines the financial condition, repayment capacity, and other credit factors of the loan to the original maker reasonably justify the credit granted by the endorser; and

(c) The loans are fully supported by documented loan files, which include, at a minimum:

(1) A credit report supporting the bank's finding that the financial condition, repayment capacity, and other factors of the maker of the notes being pledged justify the credit extended by the bank and/or endorser;

(2) A certification by a bank officer designated for that purpose by the loan or executive committee that the financial responsibility of the original notemaker has been evaluated by the loan committee and the bank is relying primarily on each such maker for the payment of the obligation; and

(3) Other credit information normally required of a borrower when making and administering a loan.
