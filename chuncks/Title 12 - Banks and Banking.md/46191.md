##### § 1248.7 Remedial actions.

(a) Based on its review of reports submitted by the Enterprises and reports issued by independent parties, if FHFA determines that there is misalignment, or the risk of misalignment, FHFA may:

(1) Require an Enterprise to undertake additional analysis, monitoring, or reporting to further the purposes of this part.

(2) Require an Enterprise to change covered programs, policies, and practices that FHFA determines conflict with the purposes of this part.

(b) To address material misalignment, FHFA may require additional and expedient Enterprise actions based on:

(1) Consultation with the Enterprises regarding the cause of the material misalignment;

(2) Review of Enterprise compliance with previously agreed upon or FHFA-required actions; and

(3) Review of the effectiveness of such actions to determine whether they are achieving the purpose of this part.

(c) Depending on the severity and cause of any material misalignment, FHFA, in its discretion, may:

(1) Require an Enterprise to terminate a program, policy, or practice; or

(2) Require the competing Enterprise to implement a comparable program, policy, or practice.

(d) When requiring an Enterprise to terminate a program, policy, or practice, or implement a comparable program, policy, or practice, FHFA will consider:

(1) The effect on TBA-eligible securities pricing and particularly on the prepayment speeds of mortgages underlying TBA-eligible MBS; and

(2) The costs borne by and the benefits likely to accrue to investors, lenders, and mortgage borrowers.
