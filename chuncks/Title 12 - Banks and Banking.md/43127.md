(e) The opportunity (under terms agreeable to the Director) to establish a schedule for the voluntary repayment of the debt or enter into a written agreement to establish a schedule for repayment of the debt in lieu of offset. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the Director, and documented in the Bureau's files;

(f) The Bureau's policy concerning interest, penalties, and administrative costs, including a statement that such assessments must be made unless excused in accordance with the FCCS or these regulations;

(k) That the Director will initiate salary offset procedures not less than 30 days from the date of the employee's receipt of the Notice of Intent to Offset, unless the employee files a timely request for a hearing;

(l) That if a hearing is held, the administrative law judge or other hearing official will issue a decision on the hearing at the earliest practical date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the request for the hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;

(m) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:

(1) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;

(2) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729 through 3731, or under any other applicable statutory authority; or

(n) That the employee also has the right to request waiver of overpayment pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5584, and may exercise any other rights and remedies available under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and

(o) That amounts paid on or deducted from the debt which are later waived or found not to be owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee, unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary.
