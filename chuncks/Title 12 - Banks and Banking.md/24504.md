(3) Whether the FDIC-supervised institution is acting as agent for such customer, as agent for both such customer and some other person, as principal for its own account, or in any other capacity;

(4) The date and time of execution, or the fact that the time of execution will be furnished within a reasonable time upon written request of the customer, and the identity, price, and number of shares or units (or principal amount in the case of debt securities) of the security purchased or sold by the customer;

(5) The amount of any remuneration received or to be received, directly or indirectly, by any broker/dealer from such customer in connection with the transaction;

(6)(i) The amount of any remuneration received or to be received by the FDIC-supervised institution from the customer, and the source and amount of any other remuneration received or to be received by the FDIC-supervised institution in connection with the transaction, unless:

(A) Remuneration is determined pursuant to a prior written agreement between the FDIC-supervised institution and the customer; or

(B) In the case of government securities and municipal securities, the FDIC-supervised institution received the remuneration in other than an agency transaction; or

(C) In the case of open end investment company securities, the FDIC-supervised institution has provided the customer with a current prospectus which discloses all current fees, loads and expenses at or before completion of the transaction;

(ii) If the FDIC-supervised institution elects not to disclose the source and amount of remuneration it has received or will receive from a party other than the customer pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section, the written notification must disclose whether the FDIC-supervised institution has received or will receive remuneration from a party other than the customer, and that the FDIC-supervised institution will furnish within a reasonable time the source and amount of this remuneration upon written request of the customer. This election is not available, however, if, with respect to a purchase, the FDIC-supervised institution was participating in a distribution of that security; or, with respect to a sale, the FDIC-supervised institution was participating in a tender offer for that security;

(7) Name of the broker/dealer utilized; or where there is no broker/dealer, the name of the person from whom the security was purchased or to whom the security was sold, or a statement that the FDIC-supervised institution will furnish this information within a reasonable time upon written request;

(8) In the case of a transaction in a debt security subject to redemption before maturity, a statement to the effect that the debt security may be redeemed in whole or in part before maturity, that the redemption could affect the yield represented and that additional information is available upon request;

(9) In the case of a transaction in a debt security effected exclusively on the basis of a dollar price:

(i) The dollar price at which the transaction was effected; and

(ii) The yield to maturity calculated from the dollar price, provided however, that this shall not apply to a transaction in a debt security that either has a maturity date that may be extended by the issuer thereof, with a variable interest payable thereon, or is an asset-backed security that represents an interest in or is secured by a pool of receivables or other financial assets that are subject continuously to prepayment;

(10) In the case of a transaction in a debt security effected on the basis of yield:

(i) The yield at which the transaction was effected, including the percentage amount and its characterization (e.g., current yield, yield to maturity, or yield to call) and if effected at yield to call, the type of call, the call date and call price;

(ii) The dollar price calculated from the yield at which the transaction was effected; and

(iii) If effected on a basis other than yield to maturity and the yield to maturity is lower than the represented yield, the yield to maturity as well as the represented yield; provided however, that this paragraph (b)(10) shall not apply to a transaction in a debt security that either has a maturity date that may be extended by the issuer with a variable interest rate payable thereon, or is an asset-backed security that represents an interest in or is secured by a pool of receivables or other financial assets that are subject continuously to prepayment;

(11) In the case of a transaction in a debt security that is an asset-backed security, which represents an interest in or is secured by a pool of receivables or other financial assets that are subject continuously to prepayment, a statement indicating that the actual yield of the asset-backed security may vary according to the rate at which the underlying receivables or other financial assets are prepaid and a statement of the fact that information concerning the factors that affect yield (including at a minimum estimated yield, weighted average life, and the prepayment assumptions underlying yield) will be furnished upon written request of the customer; and

(12) In the case of a transaction in a debt security, other than a government security, that the security is unrated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, if that is the case.
