### PART 1009 - DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS LACKING FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE (REGULATION I)
#### § 1009.3 Disclosures in periodic statements and account records.

Depository institutions lacking Federal deposit insurance must include a notice disclosing clearly and conspicuously that the institution is not federally insured, and that if the institution fails, the Federal Government does not guarantee that depositors will get back their money, in all periodic statements of account, on each signature card, and on each passbook, certificate of deposit, or share certificate. For example, a notice would comply with the requirement if it conspicuously stated: "[Institution's name] is not federally insured. If it fails, the Federal Government does not guarantee that you will get your money back." The disclosures required by this section must be clear and conspicuous and presented in a simple and easy to understand format, type size, and manner.
