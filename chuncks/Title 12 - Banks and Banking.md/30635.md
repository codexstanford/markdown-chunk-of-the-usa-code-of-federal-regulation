###### § 703.18 Grandfathered investments.

(a) Subject to safety and soundness considerations, a Federal credit union may hold a CMO/REMIC residual, stripped mortgage-backed securities, or zero coupon security with a maturity greater than 10 years, if it purchased the investment:

(1) Before December 2, 1991; or

(2) On or after December 2, 1991, but before January 1, 1998, if for the purpose of reducing interest rate risk and if the Federal credit union meets the following:

(i) The Federal credit union has a monitoring and reporting system in place that provides the documentation necessary to evaluate the expected and actual performance of the investment under different interest rate scenarios;

(ii) The Federal credit union uses the monitoring and reporting system to conduct and document an analysis that shows, before purchase, that the proposed investment will reduce its interest rate risk;

(iii) After purchase, the Federal credit union evaluates the investment at least quarterly to determine whether or not it actually has reduced the interest rate risk; and

(iv) The Federal credit union accounts for the investment consistent with generally accepted accounting principles.

(b) A federal credit union may hold a zero-coupon investment with a maturity greater than 10 years, a borrowing repurchase transaction in which the investment matures at any time later than the maturity of the borrowing, or CMRS that cause the credit union's aggregate amount of CMRS from issuers other than government-sponsored enterprises to exceed 25% of its net worth, in each case if it purchased the investment or entered the transaction under the Regulatory Flexibility Program before July 2, 2012.

(c) All grandfathered investments are subject to the valuation and monitoring requirements of §§ 703.10, 703.11, and 703.12 of this part.
