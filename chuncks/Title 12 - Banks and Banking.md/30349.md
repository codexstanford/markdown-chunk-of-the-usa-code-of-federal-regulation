###### § 702.403 Eligibility.

(a) Subject to receiving approval under § 702.408 or § 702.409, a credit union may issue Subordinated Debt only if, at the time of such issuance, the credit union is:

(1) A complex credit union with a capital classification of at least "undercapitalized," as defined in § 702.102;

(2) A LICU;

(3) Able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the NCUA that it reasonably anticipates becoming either a complex credit union meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a LICU within 24 months after issuance of the Subordinated Debt Notes; or

(4) A new credit union with Retained Earnings equal to or greater than one percent (1%) of assets.

(b) At the time of issuance of any Subordinated Debt, an Issuing Credit Union may not have any investments, direct or indirect, in Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital (or any interest therein) of another credit union. If a credit union acquires Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital in a merger or other consolidation, the Issuing Credit Union may still issue Subordinated Debt, but it may not invest (directly or indirectly) in the Subordinated Debt or Grandfathered Secondary Capital of any other credit union while any Subordinated Debt Notes issued by the Issuing Credit Union remain outstanding.

(c) If the Issuing Credit Union is a complex credit union that is not also a LICU, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Subordinated Debt issued by that Issuing Credit Union may not exceed 100 percent of its net worth, as determined at the time of each issuance of Subordinated Debt.
