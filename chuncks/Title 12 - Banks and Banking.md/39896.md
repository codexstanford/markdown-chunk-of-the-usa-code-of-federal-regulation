#### Supplement I to Part 1026-Official Interpretations
##### Negative amortization and interest rate carryover.

2.A creditor must disclose, where applicable, the possibility of negative amortization. For example, the disclosure might state, "If any of your payments is not sufficient to cover the interest due, the difference will be added to your loan amount." Loans that provide for more than one way to trigger negative amortization are separate variable-rate programs requiring separate disclosures. (See the commentary to § 1026.19(b)(2) for a discussion on the definition of a variable-rate loan program and the format for disclosure.) If a consumer is given the option to cap monthly payments that may result in negative amortization, the creditor must fully disclose the rules relating to the option, including the effects of exercising the option (such as negative amortization will occur and the principal loan balance will increase); however, the disclosure in § 1026.19(b)(2)(viii) need not be provided.
