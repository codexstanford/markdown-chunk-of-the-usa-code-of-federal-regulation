(a) An Issuing Credit Union must disclose the following language clearly, in all capital letters, on the face of a Subordinated Debt Note:

(b) An Issuing Credit Union must also clearly and accurately disclose in the Subordinated Debt Note:

(2) A general description of the NCUA's regulatory authority that includes, at a minimum:

(i) If the Issuing Credit Union is "undercapitalized" or, if the Issuing Credit Union is a New Credit Union, "moderately capitalized" (each as defined in this part), and fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan, capital restoration plan, or revised business plan, as applicable, or materially fails to implement such a plan that was approved by the NCUA, the Issuing Credit Union may be subject to all of the additional restrictions and requirements applicable to a "significantly undercapitalized" credit union or, if the Issuing Credit Union is a new credit union, a "marginally capitalized" new credit union; and

(ii) Beginning 60 days after the effective date of an Issuing Credit Union being classified as "critically undercapitalized" or, in the case of a new credit union, "uncapitalized," the Issuing Credit Union shall not pay principal of or interest on its Subordinated Debt, until reauthorized to do so by the NCUA; provided, however, that unpaid interest shall continue to accrue under the terms of the Subordinated Debt Note, to the extent permitted by law; and

(3) The risk factors associated with the NCUA's or, if applicable, the state supervisory authority's, authority to conserve or liquidate a credit union under the Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act) or applicable state law.
