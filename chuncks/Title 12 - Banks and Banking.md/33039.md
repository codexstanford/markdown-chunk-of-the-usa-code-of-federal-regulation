### PART 811-BOOK-ENTRY PROCEDURE FOR FEDERAL FINANCING BANK SECURITIES
#### § 811.5 Delivery of Federal Financing Bank securities.

A Reserve Bank which has received Federal Financing Bank securities and effected pledges, made entries regarding them, or transferred or delivered them according to the instructions of its depositor is not liable for conversion or for participation in breach of fiduciary duty even though the depositor had no right to dispose of or take other action in respect of the securities. A Reserve Bank shall be fully discharged of its obligations under this part by the delivery of Federal Financing Bank securities in definitive form to its depositor or upon the order of such depositor. Customers of a member bank or other depository (other than a Reserve Bank) may obtain Federal Financing Bank securities in definitive form only by causing the depositor of the Reserve Bank to order the withdrawal thereof from the Reserve Bank.
