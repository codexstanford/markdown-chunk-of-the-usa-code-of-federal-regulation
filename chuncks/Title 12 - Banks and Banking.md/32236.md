###### § 745.10 Accounts held by government depositors.

(a) Public funds invested in Federal credit unions and federally insured state-chartered credit unions authorized to accept such investments shall be insured as follows:

(1) Each official custodian of funds of the United States lawfully investing the same in a federally insured credit union will be separately insured in the amount of:

(i) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share draft accounts; and

(ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and regular share accounts;

(2) Each official custodian of funds of any state of the United States or any county, municipality, or political subdivision thereof lawfully investing the same in a federally insured credit union in the same state will be separately insured in the amount of:

(i) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share draft accounts; and

(ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and regular share accounts;

(3) Each official custodian of funds of the District of Columbia lawfully investing the same in a federally insured credit union in the District of Columbia will be separately insured in the amount of:

(i) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share draft accounts; and

(ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and regular share accounts;

(4) Each official custodian of funds of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, or any territory or possession of the United States, or any county, municipality, or political subdivision thereof lawfully investing the same in a federally insured credit union in Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, or any such territory or possession, respectively, will be separately insured in the amount of:

(i) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share draft accounts; and

(ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and regular share accounts;

(5) Each official custodian of tribal funds of any Indian tribe (as defined in section 3(c) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974) or agency thereof lawfully investing the same in a federally insured credit union will be separately insured in the amount of:

(i) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share draft accounts; and

(ii) Up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all share certificate and regular share accounts;

(b) Each official custodian referred to in paragraphs (a)(2), (3), and (4) of this section lawfully investing such funds in share accounts in a federally insured credit union outside of their respective jurisdictions shall be separately insured up to the SMSIA in the aggregate for all such accounts regardless of whether they are share draft, share certificate or regular share accounts.

(c) For purposes of this section, if the same person is an official custodian of more than one public unit, he shall be separately insured with respect to the public funds held by him for each such unit, but he shall not be separately insured with respect to all public funds of the same public unit by virtue of holding different offices in such unit or by holding such funds for different purposes. Where an officer, agent or employee of a public unit has custody of certain funds which by law or under a bond indenture are required to be set aside to discharge a debt owed to the holders of notes or bonds issued by the public unit, any investment of such funds in an account in a federally insured credit union will be deemed to be a share account established by a trustee of trust funds of which the noteholders or bondholders are pro rata beneficiaries, and the beneficial interest of each noteholder or bondholder in the share account will be separately insured up to the SMSIA.

(d) For purposes of this section, "lawfully investing" means pursuant to the statutory or regulatory authority of the custodian or public unit.
