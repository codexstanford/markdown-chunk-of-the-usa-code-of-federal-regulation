(a) If, in connection with the receipt of an inquiry or complaint, or during the course of an investigation, informal resolution, or formal enforcement under this subpart:

(1) The FDIC becomes aware of conduct by a Regulated Institution for which another Federal banking agency is the appropriate Federal banking agency or an Institution-Affiliated Party of such an institution, that appears to violate section 18(a) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(a)), the FDIC may recommend that the appropriate Federal banking agency take appropriate enforcement action. If the appropriate Federal banking agency does not take the recommended action within 30 days, the FDIC may pursue any and all remedies available under section 18(a) or the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(a)) and this subpart;

(2) The FDIC becomes aware of conduct that the FDIC has reason to believe violates a civil law or regulations within the jurisdiction of another regulatory authority, the FDIC may take steps to notify the appropriate authority; and

(3) The FDIC becomes aware of conduct that the FDIC has reason to believe violates 18 U.S.C. 709, the FDIC may notify FDIC's Office of Inspector General for referral to the appropriate criminal law enforcement authority.

(b) To the extent that any records are provided to a regulatory or criminal law enforcement authority, as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the provision of such records will be made in accordance with the requirements of part 309 of this chapter. Where such records were obtained during the course of an investigation, informal resolution, or formal enforcement action, the General Counsel will be considered the Director of the FDIC's Division having primary authority over records so obtained.
