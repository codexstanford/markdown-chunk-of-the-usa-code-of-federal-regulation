#### Subpart E - Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Age
##### Appendix B to Subpart E of Part 18 - List of Age Distinctions Contained in Statutes and Regulations Governing Federal Financial Assistance of the Department of Veterans Affairs

Section 90.31(f) of the governmentwide regulations (45 CFR part 90) requires each Federal agency to publish an appendix to its final regulations containing a list of age distinctions in Federal statutes and regulations affecting financial assistance administered by the agency. This appendix is VA's list of age distinctions contained in Federal statutes and VA regulations which:

(1) Provide benefits or assistance to persons based upon age; or

(2) Establish criteria for participation in age-related terms; or

(3) Describe intended beneficiaries or target groups in age-related terms.

Appendix B deals only with VA's programs of financial assistance covered by the Age Discrimination Act. It does not list age distinctions used by VA in its direct assistance programs, such as veterans' compensation. Also, this appendix contains only age distinctions in Federal statutes and VA regulations in effect on January 1, 1985.

This appendix has two sections: A list of age distinctions in Federal statutes, and a list of age distinctions in VA regulations. The first column contains the name of the program; the second column has the statute name and U.S. Code citation for statutes, or the regulation name and Code of Federal Regulations citation for regulations; the third column contains the section number of the statute or regulation and the description of the age distinction; and the fourth column cites the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for the program(s) affected where it is available.
