### PART 11 - LOANS BY BANKS ON AND PAYMENT OF ADJUSTED SERVICE CERTIFICATES
#### Loans by Banks on Adjusted Service Certificates Under Section 502 of the World War Adjusted Compensation Act
##### § 11.83 Additional loans by reason of 50 percent loan value.

(a) It will be the policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs to redeem all loans made in accordance with the law and regulations made pursuant thereto, when such loans are made in good faith to the veteran to whom the certificate was issued. If, while his certificate is held by a bank as security for a loan, the veteran applies for the increased loan value authorized by the amendment to the World War Adjusted Compensation Act dated February 27, 1931, whether or not the loan has matured, the veteran and the bank will be informed fully of the provisions of this section and that the bank may make the loan for the additional amount or, upon request of the veteran, may send the note and certificate to the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs. The Secretary shall, if the loan was legally made, accept such certificate and note, and pay to the bank in full satisfaction of its claim the amount of the unpaid principal due it and the unpaid interest at the rate authorized by the World War Adjusted Compensation Act, as amended, up to the date of the check issued to the bank. If the veteran has not filed application for final settlement of his adjusted service certificate under the provisions of the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, 1936, and demand is made upon the bank to present the note and certificate for redemption prior to the maturity date of the loan and during the lifetime of the veteran, interest will be payable up to the date the check is issued to the bank, or, if demanded by the bank, up to the maturity date of the loan.

(b) If, however, an application for final settlement is filed and the bank is notified to present the note and certificate to the Secretary and does so within 15 days after the mailing of such notice interest will be payable to the date the check is issued to the bank. If the bank fails to forward the note and certificate within 15 days after the mailing of the notice, interest shall be paid only up to the fifteenth day after the mailing of such notice.
