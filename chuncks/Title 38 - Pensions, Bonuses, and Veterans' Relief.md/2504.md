## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 12 - DISPOSITION OF VETERAN'S PERSONAL FUNDS AND EFFECTS
#### Disposition of Veteran's Personal Funds and Effects on Facility Upon Death, or Discharge, or Unauthorized Absence, and of Funds and Effects Found on Facility
##### § 12.12 Miscellaneous provisions.

If it is shown that some person other than the veteran has title to property in a veteran's possession at the time of death, nothing contained in §§ 12.0 to 12.12 shall be construed as prohibiting delivery of such property to the owner. A life insurance policy may be delivered to the beneficiary therein named if the insured is deceased, notwithstanding the veteran has designated a person to whom possession of his or her property at the field facility is to be transferred. In no case will funds or effects be delivered to a minor, or to an incompetent person other than as provided in § 12.9 (a) and (c), but where any such person is entitled to title or possession delivery may be made to his or her guardian.
