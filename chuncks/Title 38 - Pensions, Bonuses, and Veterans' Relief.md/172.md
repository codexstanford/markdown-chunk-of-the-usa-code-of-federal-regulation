#### Disclosures Without Patient Consent
##### § 1.486 Disclosure of information related to infection with the human immunodeficiency virus to public health authorities.

(a) In the case of any record which is maintained in connection with the performance of any program or activity relating to infection with the HIV, information may be disclosed to a Federal, State, or local public health authority, charged under Federal or State law with the protection of the public health, and to which Federal or State law requires disclosure of such record, if a qualified representative of such authority has made a written request that such record be provided as required pursuant to such law for a purpose authorized by such law. In the case of a State law, such law must, in order for VA to be able to release patient name and address information in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5701(f)(2), provide for a penalty or fine or other sanction to be assessed against those individuals who are subject to the jurisdiction of the public health authority but fail to comply with the reporting requirements.

(b) A person to whom a record is disclosed under this section may not redisclose or use such record for a purpose other than that for which the disclosure was made.
