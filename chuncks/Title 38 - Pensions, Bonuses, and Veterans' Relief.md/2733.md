##### § 14.667 Claims payable.

(a) No claim shall be paid unless timely filed in proper form as provided in § 14.665 and the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the loss or damage:

(1) Actually occurred and the amount claimed is reasonable,

(2) Was incident to the employee's service and his or her possession of the property was reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances,

(3) Did not occur at quarters occupied within the 50 States or the District of Columbia that were not assigned to the claimant or otherwise provided in kind by the United States.

(4) Was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent act of claimant, the claimant's agent, or employee, and that the claimant has no right to indemnification for the loss or damage from other than the United States, except to the extent that the claimant assigns such right to the United States and agrees to furnish evidence required to enable the United States to enforce such right. In the event there is a right to recovery for the loss or damage from a carrier or insurer the claimant will be required to file a timely claim for such recovery before consideration of the claim against the United States.

(b) No claim for the cost of repair or replacement of personal property of employees damaged or destroyed by patients or domiciliary members while such employees are engaged in the performance of official duties shall be entertained under §§ 14.664 through 14.667, unless claim filed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 703(a)(5) (§ 17.78 of this chapter) has been finally denied for the reason that such claim did not meet the criteria established by that law.
