(6) The loan conforms otherwise to the requirements of the § 36.4200 series.

(b) Notwithstanding that the veteran-borrower's obligation for such site preparation be evidenced and secured separately from the obligation for purchase of the manufactured home, the obligations together shall constitute one loan for the purposes of the § 36.4200 series, including computation of the Secretary's guaranty liability.

(c) The cost of site preparation which will not be paid from the proceeds of the loan must be paid by the veteran in cash from the veteran's own resources.
