###### § 36.4224 Refinancing existing manufactured home loan including purchase of lot.

(a) A veteran may refinance (38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(G)) an existing purchase money lien on a manufactured home owned and occupied by the veteran as his or her home in conjunction with a loan to acquire a suitable lot on which that manufactured home is or will be located provided the following requirements are met.

(1) The loan application must be submitted to the Secretary for prior approval;

(2) The loan must be secured by the same manufactured home which is being refinanced and the real property on which the manufactured home is or will be located.

(3) The amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced; the purchase price, not to exceed the reasonable value of the lot, as authorized in § 36.4252; the costs of necessary site preparation of the lot as determined by the Secretary; a reasonable discount as authorized in § 36.4204(d)(8) with respect to that portion of the loan used to refinance the existing purchase money lien on the manufactured home, and closing costs as authorized in § 36.4232 or § 36.4254, as appropriate.

(b) If the loan being refinanced was guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the portion of the loan made for the purpose of refinancing an existing purchase money manufactured home loan may be guaranteed without regard to the outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by the veteran, and the veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for the refinancing portion of the loan. For the purposes enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3702(b) the refinancing portion of the loan shall be considered to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced. Guaranty for the refinancing loan shall be computed by first applying to the loan a combined total of the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced and second any additional guaranty entitlement available to the veteran for manufactured home purposes, up to a maximum of $20,000 or forty (40) percent of the original principal amount of the loan, whichever is less.
