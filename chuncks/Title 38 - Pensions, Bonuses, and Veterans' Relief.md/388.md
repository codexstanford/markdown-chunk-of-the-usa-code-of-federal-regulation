(1) The nature and amount of the debt;

(2) VA's intention to pursue collection by offset procedures;

(3) The opportunity to inspect and copy VA records pertaining to the debt;

(4) The right to contest both the existence and amount of the debt and to request a waiver of collection of the debt (if applicable), as well as the right to a hearing on both matters;

(6) Other applicable notices required by §§ 1.911, 1.911a, 1.912, and 1.912a.

(d) The written certification required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section will also contain (for all debts) a listing of all actions taken by both VA and the debtor subsequent to the notice, as well as the dates of such actions.
