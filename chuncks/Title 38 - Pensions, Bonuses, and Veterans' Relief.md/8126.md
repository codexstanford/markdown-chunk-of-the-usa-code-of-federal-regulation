##### § 36.4505 Maturity of loan.

(a) The maturity of a loan shall not exceed 25 years and 32 days. If the Department of Veterans Affairs determines the income and expenses of a veteran-applicant under customary credit standards would prevent the veteran from making the required loan payments for a loan which matures in 25 years and 32 days, but the veteran would be able to make the loan payments over a longer period of time, the loan may be made with a maturity not in excess of 30 years and 32 days.

(b) Every loan shall be repayable within the estimated economic life of the property securing the loan.

(c) Nothing in this section shall preclude extension of the loan pursuant to the provisions of § 36.4506.
