#### Calculation of Time Period
##### § 8.6 Calculation of Time Period; Veteran's Age.

(a) If the last day of a time period specified in § 8.2 or § 8.3, or the last day allowed for filing an application for National Service Life Insurance or for applying for reinstatement thereof, or paying premiums due thereon, falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the time period will be extended to include the following workday.

(b) For VALife, the premium will be determined using the age of the veteran at his or her nearest birthday on the effective date of the policy.

(c) For purposes of determining a veteran's eligibility for VALife under 38 U.S.C. 1922B(a)(3)(A), the age of the veteran at his or her last birthday prior to the date of application will be used.

(d) For purposes of determining a veteran's eligibility for VALife under 38 U.S.C. 1922B(a)(3)(B), with respect to a veteran who has attained 81 years of age, an initial grant of service connection for a new or secondary condition for which the veteran applied for disability compensation before attaining 81 years of age will satisfy the eligibility criteria; however, VA will not grant insurance to such a veteran based on an increase in an existing disability rating, a grant of individual unemployability under 38 CFR 4.18, or a finding of incompetency under 38 CFR 3.353. VA will not issue a VALife policy to a veteran over age 95.
