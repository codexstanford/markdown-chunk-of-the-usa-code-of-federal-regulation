VA may provide an additional period of training or services under a vocational training program to an eligible child who has completed training for a vocational goal and/or been suitably employed under this subpart, if the child is otherwise eligible and has remaining program entitlement as provided in § 21.8072(b), only under one of the following conditions:

(b) The occupation that was the child's vocational goal under this subpart is now unsuitable;

(c) The vocational training program services and assistance the child originally received are now inadequate to make the child employable in the occupation which he or she sought to achieve;

(e) Technological change that occurred after the child achieved a vocational goal under this subpart now prevents the child from:

(1) Performing the duties of the occupation for which VA provided training, services, or assistance, or in a related occupation; or
