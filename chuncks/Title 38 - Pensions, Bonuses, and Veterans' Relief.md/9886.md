### PART 200 - COMPLIANCE WITH THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT
#### Appendix C to Part 200 - Actions Requiring Environmental Impact Statement

The following actions are considered to be major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and therefore must be the subjects of EIS, as indicates may have significant environmental effects:

C.1 Acquisition of space by Federal construction or lease construction, or expansion or improvement of an existing facility, where one or more of the following applies:

C.1(a) The structure and/or proposed use are not substantially consistent with local planning and zoning or any applicable State or Federal requirements.

C.1(b) The proposed use will substantially increase the number of motor vehicles at the facility.

C.1(c) The site and scale of construction are not consistent with those of existing adjacent or nearby buildings.

C.1(d) There is evidence of current or potential environmental controversy.

C.2 Space acquisition programs projected for a substantial geographical area (e.g., a metropolitan area) for a 3-to-5-year period or greater (Note: a Programmatic EIS is often appropriate here, from which subsequent EISs and EAs can be tiered).
