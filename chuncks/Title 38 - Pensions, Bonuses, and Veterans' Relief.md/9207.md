(D) Quarter 4 (July-September) assessment completed not later than October 30.

(ii) A valid assessment must include the following:

(A) The PIP must identify the activity which falls below the measure. The PIP must describe the reason(s) why the recipient did not meet the performance measure(s) and provide specific proposed corrective action(s) and a timetable for accomplishment of the corrective action.
