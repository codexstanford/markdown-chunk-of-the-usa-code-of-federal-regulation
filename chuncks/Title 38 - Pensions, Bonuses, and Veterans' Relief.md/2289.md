#### Extended Term and Paid-Up Insurance
##### § 8.15 Provision for paid-up insurance; other than 5-year level premium term or limited convertible 5-year level premium term policies.

(a) If a National Service Life Insurance policy on any plan other than 5-year level premium term or limited convertible 5-year level premium term plan has not been surrendered for cash, upon written request of the insured and complete surrender of the insurance with all claims thereunder, after the expiration of the first policy year and while the policy is in force under premium-paying conditions, the United States will issue paid-up insurance for such amount as the cash value less any indebtedness, and a charge for administrative cost for insurance issued under 38 U.S.C. 1925, will purchase when applied as a net single premium at the attained age of the insured. For this purpose the attained age is the age on the birthday anniversary nearest to the effective date of the policy plus the number of years and months from that date to the date the paid-up insurance becomes effective. Such paid-up insurance will be effective as of the expiration of the period for which premiums have been paid and earned; and, any premiums paid in advance for months subsequent to that in which the application for paid-up insurance is made shall be refunded to the insured. The paid-up insurance, if eligible to participate in and to receive dividends, shall be with the right to dividends. The insured may at any time surrender the paid-up policy for its cash value or obtain a loan on such paid-up insurance.

(b) The United States shall not issue paid-up insurance under VALife until the insured has paid premiums during the two-year waiting period imposed by 38 U.S.C. 1922B(c)(2) before VALife coverage is in force.
