###### § 36.4215 Maintenance of records.

(a) The holder shall maintain a record of the amounts of payments received on the obligation and disbursements chargeable thereto and the dates thereof. This record shall be maintained until the Secretary ceases to be liable as guarantor of the loan. For the purpose of any accounting with the Secretary or computation of claim against the Secretary, any holder who fails to maintain such record shall be presumed to have received on the dates due all sums which by the terms of the contract are payable prior to date of claim, and the burden of going forward with evidence and of ultimate proof of the contrary shall be on such holder.

(b) The lender shall retain copies of all loan origination records on VA guaranteed loan for at least one year from the date of loan closing. Loan origination records include the loan application, including any preliminary application, verifications of employment and deposit, all credit reports, including preliminary credit reports, copies of each sales contract and addendums, letters of explanation for adverse credit items, discrepancies and the like, direct references from creditors, correspondence with employers, appraisal reports, reports on other inspections of the property, and all closing papers and documents.

(c) The Secretary has the right to inspect, examine, or audit, at a reasonable time and place, the records or accounts of a lender or holder pertaining to loans guaranteed by the Secretary.
