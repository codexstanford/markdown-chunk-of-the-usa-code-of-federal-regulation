## Chapter I - Department of Veterans Affairs
### PART 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS
#### Salary Offset Provisions
##### § 1.983 Notice requirements before salary offsets of debts not involving benefits under the laws administered by VA.

(a) For a debt not involving benefits under the laws administered by VA, the Secretary or designee will review the records relating to the debt to assure that it is owed prior to providing the employee with a notice of the debt.

(b) Except as provided in § 1.980(e), salary offset of debts not involving benefits under the laws administered by VA will not be made unless the Secretary or designee first provides the employee with a minimum of 30 calendar days written notice. This notice will state:

(1) The Secretary or designee's determination that a debt is owed;

(2) The amount of the debt owed and the facts giving rise to the debt;

(3) The Secretary or designee's intention to collect the debt by means of deduction from the employee's current disposable pay account until the debt and all accumulated interest and associated costs are paid in full;

(4) The amount, frequency, approximate beginning date, and duration of the intended deductions;

(5) An explanation of VA's requirements concerning interest, administrative costs, and penalties;

(6) The employee's right to inspect and copy VA records relating to the debt or, if the employee or his or her representative cannot personally inspect the records, to request and receive a copy of such records;

(7) The employee's right to enter into a written agreement with the Secretary or designee for a repayment schedule differing from that proposed by the Secretary or designee, so long as the terms of the repayment schedule proposed by the employee are agreeable to the Secretary or designee;

(8) The VA employee's right to request an oral or paper hearing on the Secretary or appropriate designee's determination of the existence or amount of the debt, or the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period, so long as a request is filed by the employee as prescribed by the Secretary. The hearing official for the hearing requested by a VA employee must be either a VA administrative law judge or a hearing official from an agency other than VA. Any VA hearing official may conduct an oral or paper hearing at the request of a non-VA employee on the determination by an appropriately designated official of the employing agency of the existence or amount of the debt, or the percentage of disposable pay to be deducted each pay period, so long as a hearing request is filed by the non-VA employee as prescribed by the employing agency.

(9) The method and time period for requesting a hearing;

(10) That the timely filing of a request for a hearing (oral or paper) will stay the commencement of salary offset;

(11) That a final decision after the hearing will be issued at the earliest practical date, but no later than 60 calendar days after the filing of the request for the hearing, unless the employee requests and the hearing officer grants a delay in the proceedings;

(12) That any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to:

(i) Disciplinary procedures appropriate under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75, 5 CFR part 752, or any other applicable statutes or regulations;

(ii) Penalties under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3731, or any other applicable statutory authority; or

(iii) Criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 1001, and 1002 or any other applicable statutory authority.

(13) The employee's right, if applicable, to request waiver under 5 U.S.C. 5584 and 38 CFR 1.963a and any other rights and remedies available to the employee under statutes or regulations governing the program for which the collection is being made; and

(14) Unless there are applicable contractual or statutory provisions to the contrary, that amounts paid on or deducted for the debt which are later waived or found not owed to the United States will be promptly refunded to the employee.
