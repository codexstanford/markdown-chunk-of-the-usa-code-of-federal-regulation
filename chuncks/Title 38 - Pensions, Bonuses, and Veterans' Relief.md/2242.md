#### Total Permanent Disability Benefits
##### § 6.18 Other disabilities deemed to be total and permanent.

(a) In addition to the conditions specified in 38 U.S.C. 1958, the following also will be deemed to be total and permanent disabilities: Organic loss of speech; permanently helpless or permanently bedridden.

(b) Organic loss of speech will mean the loss of the ability to express oneself, both by voice and whisper, through the normal organs of speech if such loss is caused by organic changes in such organs. Where such loss exists, the fact that some speech can be produced through the use of an artificial appliance or other organs of the body will be disregarded.
