#### Subpart I - Advance Ruling Procedures
##### § 181.94 Nonconforming requests for advance rulings.

A person submitting a request for an advance ruling that does not comply with all of the provisions of this subpart will be so notified in writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be pointed out. Such person will be given a period of 30 calendar days from the date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may provide) to supply any additional information that is requested or otherwise conform the advance ruling request to the requirements referred to in the notice. The Customs file with respect to advance ruling requests which are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this subpart within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and the request removed from active consideration. A request for an advance ruling that is removed from active consideration by reason of failure to comply with the provisions of this subpart may be treated as withdrawn. A failure to comply with the provisions of this subpart will result in the rejection of the advance ruling request with the notice specifying the deficiencies.
