### PART 191 - DRAWBACK
#### Appendix B to Part 191 - Sample Formats for Applications for Specific Manufacturing Drawback Rulings

These sample formats for applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings must be submitted to and reviewed and approved by CBP Headquarters. A specific manufacturing drawback ruling consists of the letter of approval that CBP issues to the applicant, a synopsis of which is published in the Customs Bulletin, as provided in 19 CFR 191.8. In these application formats, remarks in parentheses and footnotes are for explanatory purposes only and should not be copied. Other material should be quoted directly in the applications.

Dear Sir: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, §§ 1313 (a) & (b), and part 191 of the CBP Regulations. We request that the Customs Service authorize drawback on the basis of this application.

(Section 191.8(a) of the CBP Regulations provides that each manufacturer or producer of articles intended for exportation with the benefit of drawback shall apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under § 191.7 of the CBP Regulations. Customs will not approve an application which shows an unincorporated division or company as the applicant (see § 191.8(a)).)

(Give the address of the factory(s) where the process of manufacture or production will take place. If the factory is a different legal entity from the applicant, so state and indicate if operating under an Agent's general manufacturing drawback ruling.)

(List persons legally authorized to bind the corporation who will sign drawback documents. Section 191.6 of the CBP Regulations permits only the president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, or any employee legally authorized to bind the corporation to sign for a corporation. In addition, a person within a business entity with a Customs power of attorney for the company may sign. A Customs power of attorney may also be given to a licensed Customs broker. This heading should be changed to Names of Partners or Proprietor in the case of a partnership or sole proprietorship, respectively (see footnote at end of this sample format for persons who may sign applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings).)

I declare that I have read this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling; that I know the averments and agreements contained herein are true and correct; and that my signature on this ________ day of __________________ 19____, makes this application binding on

Dear Sir: We, (Applicant's Name), a (State, e.g., Delaware) corporation (or other described entity) submit this application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling that our manufacturing operations qualify for drawback under title 19, United States Code, section 1313(d), and part 191 of the Customs Regulations. We request that the Customs Service authorize drawback on the basis of this application.

We will maintain records to establish:

1. That the exported articles on which drawback is claimed were produced with the use of a particular lot (or lots) of domestic tax-paid alcohol, and

2. The quantity of domestic tax-paid alcoholwe used in producing the exported articles.

We realize that to obtain drawback the claimant must establish that the completed articles were exported within 5 years after the tax has been paid on the domestic alcohol. Our records establishing our compliance with these requirements will be available for audit by Customs during business hours. We understand that drawback is not payable without proof of compliance.

The "Appearing In" basis may be used regardless of whether there is waste. If the "Appearing In" basis is used, the claimant does not need to keep records of waste and its value. However, the manufacturer must establish the identity and quantity of the merchandise appearing in the exported product and provide this information. Waste reduces the amount of drawback when claims are made on the "Appearing In" basis. Drawback is payable on 100% of the tax paid on the quantity of domestic alcohol which appears in the exported articles.

We shall claim drawback on the quantity of (specify material) used in manufacturing (exported article) according to the schedule set forth below.

We request permission to file supplemental schedules with the drawback office covering changes in the quantities of material used to produce the exported articles, or different styles or capacities of containers of such exported merchandise.
