##### § 171.14 Headquarters advice.

The advice of the Director, Border Security and Trade Compliance Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, or his designee, may be sought in any case (except as provided in this section), without regard to delegated authority to act on a petition or offer, when a novel or complex issue concerning a ruling, policy, or procedure is presented concerning a CBP action(s) or potential CBP action(s) relating to seizures and forfeitures, penalties, or mitigating or remitting any claim. This section does not apply to actual duty loss tenders determined by CBP pursuant to § 162.74(c) of this Chapter relating to prior disclosure and to actual duty loss demands made under § 162.79b of this Chapter. The request for advice may be initiated by the alleged violator or any CBP officer, but must be submitted to the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer retains the authority to refuse to forward any request that fails to raise a qualifying issue and to seek legal advice from the appropriate Associate or Assistant Chief Counsel in any case.
