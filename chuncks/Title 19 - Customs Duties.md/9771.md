If a panel or ECC decides that the Commission is required, pursuant to the United States law, to grant access pursuant to a protective order to information for which the Commission has claimed a privilege, any individual to whom the panel or ECC has directed the Commission release information and who is otherwise within the category of individuals eligible to receive proprietary information pursuant to § 207.93(b), may file an application for a protective order with the Commission.
