###### § 10.462 Packing materials and containers for shipment.

(a) Packing materials and containers for shipment, as defined in § 10.450(m), are to be disregarded in determining whether the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in General Note 26(n), HTSUS.
