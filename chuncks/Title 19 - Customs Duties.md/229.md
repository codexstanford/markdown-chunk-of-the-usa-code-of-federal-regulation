###### § 10.3 Drawback; internal-revenue tax.

(a) Except as prescribed in § 10.1(f) or in paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section, no free entry shall be allowed under Chapter 98, Subchapter 1, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), in the final liquidation of an entry unless the Center director is satisfied by the certificate of exportation or other evidence or information that no drawback was allowed in connection with the exportation from the United States, and unless no internal-revenue tax is imposed on the importation of like articles not previously exported from the United States or, if such tax is being imposed at the time of entry for consumption or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, the Center director is satisfied that an internal-revenue tax on production or importation was paid in respect of the imported article before it was exported from the United States and was not refunded. Except as provided for in § 10.1(f), when it is impracticable, because of the destruction of Customs records or other circumstances, to determine whether drawback was allowed, or the amount of drawback allowed, with respect to an article established to be a returned product of the United States which has not been advanced in value or improved in condition while abroad, there shall be assessed on the returned article an amount of duty determined as follows:

(1) If there is any likelihood that drawback was allowable on the exportation of like articles at any time when the imported article may have been exported from the United States, the estimated amount of any drawback which would have been allowable if duty had been paid on any foreign merchandise likely to have been used in the manufacture of the returned article at the rate or rates applicable to such foreign merchandise on the date of importation of the returned article (see paragraph (b) of this section), and

(2) If there is any likelihood that a refund or remission of tax was allowed on the exportation of the returned article, the amount of any internal-revenue tax which would be payable at the time of importation if the returned article were wholly of foreign origin, but in no such case shall there be assessed more than an amount equal to the duty and tax that would apply if the returned article were wholly of foreign origin and originally imported. (See § 10.7(a).) Except as provided for in § 10.1(f), if the imported article is of a kind which would be subject to an internal-revenue tax if of foreign origin and payment of an internal-revenue tax before exportation without refund thereof is not established, duty shall be assessed on the imported article in an amount equal to the internal-revenue tax imposed at the time of entry for consumption or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption on like articles of foreign origin, plus the amount of any drawback allowed on the exportation of the article from the United States; but if no drawback was allowed, the duty equal to internal-revenue tax shall be the total duty to be assessed. If an allowance of drawback on the exportation from the United States of the imported article is established, duty shall be assessed in an amount equal to such drawback, plus an amount equal to any internal-revenue tax which may be assessable in accordance with this paragraph; but in no case shall duty equal to drawback, or to drawback and internal-revenue tax, be assessed in an amount in excess of the ordinary Customs duty and internal-revenue tax applicable to like articles of foreign origin. In any case, where payment of internal-revenue tax before exportation without refund thereof is established, no duty equal to an internal-revenue tax currently in force shall be assessed.

(b) In the absence of satisfactory evidence as to the nonallowance of drawback or the amount thereof allowed on the following articles of American manufacture or production, duty shall be assessed thereon in the amounts respectively indicated, the amount shown in each case being considered the fair average amount of drawback allowed on such articles:

(c) The following articles shall be admitted free of duty, even though exported from the United States with benefit of drawback:

(1) Any article of a kind which would be admitted free of duty otherwise than under Chapter 98, Subchapter 1, HTSUS, if of foreign origin;

(2) Substantial containers or holders of domestic manufacture, including shooks and staves when returned as boxes or barrels, when in use at the time of importation as the usual containers of merchandise;

(3) Any article provided for in subheadings 9801.00.70 or 9801.00.80, HTSUS, with respect to which the Center director has determined that the collection of duty under such subheadings 9801.00.70 or 9801.00.80, HTSUS, would involve an expense and inconvenience to the Government disproportionate to the probable amount of such duty; and

(4) Other articles of domestic manufacture which are in use at the time of importation as the usual coverings or containers of merchandise not subject to an ad valorem rate of duty, and which have not been advanced in value or improved in condition while abroad by any process of manufacture or other means.

(d) Articles manufactured or produced in the United States in a Customs bonded warehouse and exported shall be subject on reimportation to a duty equal to the total duty and internal-revenue tax, if any, imposed at the time of entry for consumption or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption with respect to the importation of like articles not previously exported from the United States.

(e) Animals straying across the border or driven across the border for pasturage purposes or for feeding to improve them for the market and not returned within 8 months are excluded from free entry as domestic products returned.

(f) Tobacco products and cigarette papers and tubes classifiable under subheading 9801.00.80, HTSUS, may be released from customs custody without the payment of that part of the duty attributable to the internal-revenue tax for return to internal-revenue bond as provided by section 5704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
