##### § 11.12 Labeling of wool products to indicate fiber content.
###### et seq.)

(a) Wool products imported into the United States, except those made more than 20 years prior to importation, and except carpets, rugs, mats, and upholsteries, shall have affixed thereto a stamp, tag, label, or other means of identification, as required by the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939 (54 Stat. 1129; 15 U.S.C. 68and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR part 300). The term "wool product" means any product, or any portion of a product, which contains, purports to contain, or in any way is represented as containing wool, reprocessed wool, or reused wool.

(b) If imported wool products are not correctly labeled and the Center director is satisfied that the error or omission involved no fraud or willful neglect, the importer shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to label the merchandise under Customs supervision to conform with the requirements of such act and the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission. The compensation and expenses of Customs officers and employees assigned to supervise the labeling shall be reimbursed to the Government and shall be assessed in the same manner as in the case of marking of country of origin, § 134.55 of this chapter.

(c) Packages of wool products subject to the provisions of this section which are not designated for examination may be released pending examination of the designated packages, but only if there shall have been filed in connection with the entry bonds on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 and/or § 113.68 of this chapter, as appropriate, in such amount as the Center director may require.

(d) The Center director shall give written notice to the importer of any lack of compliance with the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939 in respect of an importation of wool products, and pursuant to § 141.113 of this chapter shall demand the immediate return of the involved products to Customs custody, unless the lack of compliance is forthwith corrected.

(e) If the products covered by a notice and demand given pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section are not promptly returned to Customs custody and the Center director is not fully satisfied that they have been brought into compliance with the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939, appropriate action shall be taken to effect the collection of liquidated damages in an amount equal to the entered value of the merchandise not redelivered, plus the estimated duty thereon as determined at the time of entry, unless the owner or consignee shall file with the appropriate Customs officer an application for cancellation of the liability incurred under the bond upon the payment as liquidated damages of a lesser amount than the full amount of the liquidated damages incurred, or upon the basis of such other terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may deem sufficient. The application shall contain a full statement of the reasons for the requested cancellation and shall be in duplicate.

(f) If any fraudulent violation of the act with respect to imported articles comes to the attention of the Center director, the involved merchandise shall be placed under seizure, or a demand shall be made for the redelivery of the merchandise if it has been released from Customs custody, and the case shall be reported to the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C.
