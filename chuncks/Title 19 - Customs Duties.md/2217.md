####### Verification.

(a)A claim for preferential tariff treatment made under § 10.3003(b) or § 10.3011, including any statements or other information submitted to CBP in support of the claim, will be subject to such verification as the Center director deems necessary. In the event that the Center director is provided with insufficient information to verify or substantiate the claim, or the Center director finds a pattern of conduct, indicating that an importer, exporter, or producer has provided false or unsupported declarations or certifications, or the exporter or producer fails to consent to a verification visit, the Center director may deny the claim for preferential treatment. A verification of a claim for preferential tariff treatment under CTPA for goods imported into the United States may be conducted by means of one or more of the following:

(1) Written requests for information from the importer, exporter, or producer;

(2) Written questionnaires to the importer, exporter, or producer;

(3) Visits to the premises of the exporter or producer in the territory of Colombia, to review the records of the type referred to in § 10.3009(c)(1) or to observe the facilities used in the production of the good, in accordance with the framework that the Parties develop for conducting verifications; and

(4) Such other procedures to which the Parties may agree.
