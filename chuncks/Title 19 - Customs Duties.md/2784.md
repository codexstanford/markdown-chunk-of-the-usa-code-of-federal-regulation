(b) If credit is being applied to a charge set up by a theoretical transfer under § 19.24 at the plant designated in the withdrawal to receive the credit, the wastages to be applied shall be those set up at such plant in connection with the theoretical transfer, irrespective of the date of the withdrawal.
