### PART 191 - DRAWBACK
#### Subpart S - Drawback Compliance Program
##### § 191.195 Combined application for certification in drawback compliance program and waiver of prior notice and/or approval of accelerated payment of drawback.

An applicant for certification in the drawback compliance program may also, in the same application, apply for waiver of prior notice of intent to export and accelerated payment of drawback, under subpart I of this part. Alternatively, an applicant may separately apply for certification in the drawback compliance program and either or both waiver of prior notice and accelerated payment of drawback. In the former instance, the intent to apply for certification and waiver of prior notice and/or approval of accelerated payment of drawback must be clearly stated. In all instances, all of the requirements for certification and the procedure applied for must be met (for example, in a combined application for certification in the drawback compliance program and both procedures, all of the information required for certification and each procedure, all required sample documents for certification and each procedure, and all required certifications must be included in and with the application).
