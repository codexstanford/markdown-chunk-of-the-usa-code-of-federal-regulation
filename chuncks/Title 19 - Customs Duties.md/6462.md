### PART 159 - LIQUIDATION OF DUTIES
#### Subpart E - Suspension of Liquidation
##### § 159.51 General.

Liquidation of entries shall not be suspended simply because issues involved therein may be before the Customs Court in pending litigation, since the importer may seek relief by protesting the entries after liquidation.
