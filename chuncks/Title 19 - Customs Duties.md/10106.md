###### § 212.01 Purpose.

(a) The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called "the Act" in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called "adversary adjudications") before an agency. Under the Act an eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligible for awards and the Commission proceedings that are covered. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Commission will use to make them.
