A party-at-interest, other than the party-at-interest which requested and received the initial final determination, may ask Customs to consider the matter anew and issue, on an expedited basis, a new final determination. Such a request shall specifically identify the previous final determination. Upon receipt of such a request, Customs will issue a new final determination within five working days of receipt of the request unless (a) the previous final determination was the subject of a contested lawsuit timely filed in the Court of International Trade under 28 U.S.C. 1581(e) or, (b) the merchandise at issue in the initial final determination was tendered and deemed responsive to the request for proposals or an invitation for bids in a competitive procurement subject to the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a) and a contract under such procurement was let. Any new final determination issued under this section shall be published in accordance with § 177.29 and is reviewable under § 177.30.
