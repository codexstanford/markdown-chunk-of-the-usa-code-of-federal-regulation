(a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the Commission. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Commission is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. The Commission proceedings covered are those conducted under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1337. No award shall be made, however, for fees and expenses related to those portions of the proceedings conducted for the consideration of relief, the public interest, and bonding pursuant to subsections 337 (d), (e), and (f) of the Tariff Act of 1930 and 19 CFR 210.14.

(b) An award may be made against the Commission only in connection with a proceeding brought by the Commission upon its own complaint.

(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
