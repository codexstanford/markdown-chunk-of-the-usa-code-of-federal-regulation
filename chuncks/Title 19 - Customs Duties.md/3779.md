### PART 118 - CENTRALIZED EXAMINATION STATIONS
#### Subpart B - Application To Establish a CES
##### § 118.11 Contents of application.

Each application to operate a CES shall consist of the following information, any application not providing all of the specified information will not be considered, and the responses to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (g) and (h) of this section shall constitute the criteria used to judge the application:

(a) The name and address of the facility to be operated as the CES, the names of all principals or corporate officers, and the name and telephone number of an individual to be contacted for further information;

(b) A description of the CES's accessibility within the port or other location, and a floor plan of the facility actually dedicated to the CES operation showing bay doors, office space, exterior features, security features, and staging and work space. Where a significant capital expenditure would be required in order for an existing facility to meet security or other physical or equipment requirements necessary for the CES operation, the applicant may request in the application time to conform the facility to such requirements. The agreement referred to in § 118.3 of this part shall not be executed, in any event, until the facility is conformed to meet the requirements;

(c) A schedule of fees clearly showing what the applicant will charge for each type of service. Subject to any special costs incurred by the applicant such as facility modifications to meet specific cargo handling or storage requirements or to meet Customs security standards, the fees set forth in the schedule shall be comparable to fees charged for similar services in the area to be served by the CES;

(d) A detailed list of equipment showing that the applicant can make a diverse variety of cargo available for examination in an efficient and timely manner;

(e) A copy of an approved custodial bond on Customs Form 301. If the applicant does not possess such a bond, a completed Customs Form 301 must be included with the application for approval as a prerequisite to selection;

(f) A list of all employees involved in the CES operation setting forth their names, dates of birth, and social security numbers. (Providing social security numbers is voluntary; however, failure to provide the number may hinder the investigation process.);

(g) Any information showing the applicant's experience in international cargo operations and knowledge of Customs procedures and regulations; and

(h) Any other information to address any local criteria that the port director considers essential to the selection process based on port conditions.
