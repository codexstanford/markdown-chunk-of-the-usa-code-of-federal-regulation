(a) Articles which bear, or the containers which bear, false designations of origin, or false descriptions or representations, including words or other symbols tending falsely to describe or represent the articles, are prohibited importation under 15 U.S.C. 294, 295, 296, 1124, 1125 or 48 U.S.C. 1405q, and shall be detained.

(b) Articles made in whole or in part of gold or silver or alloys thereof imported for sale by manufacturers or dealers which are marked or labeled in a manner indicating a greater degree of fineness than the actual fineness of the gold or silver or alloys thereof, and any plated or filled articles so imported which are marked or labeled to indicate the fineness of the gold or silver and are not also marked or labeled to indicate the plated or filled condition or are marked or labeled with the word "sterling" or the word "coin", are prohibited importation and shall be detained, and the facts shall be reported to the United States attorney.

(c) Whenever any articles are detained in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section, and the case of any articles detained under paragraph (b) of this section the United States attorney has indicated that he does not intend to prosecute, the articles shall be seized and forfeited in the usual manner, except that, upon the filing of a petition therefor by the importer prior to final disposition of the articles, the port director may release the articles upon the condition that the prohibited marking be removed or obliterated or that the articles and containers be properly marked to indicate their origin, contents, or condition, or may permit the articles to be exported or destroyed under Customs supervision, and without expense to the Government.

(d) Articles forfeited for violation of section 294, 1124, or 1125, Title 15 and section 545, Title 18, U.S. Code, may be disposed of in accordance with the procedure applicable to other Customs forfeitures, but may not be released from Customs custody except upon the removal by and at the expense of the party in interest of the prohibited marking by reason of which the articles were seized, except articles disposed of under § 133.52 (a) or (b) of this chapter.
