###### § 10.732 De minimis.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a good that does not undergo a change in tariff classification pursuant to General Note 28(n), HTSUS, is an originating good if:

(1) The value of all non-originating materials used in the production of the good that do not undergo the applicable change in tariff classification does not exceed 10 percent of the adjusted value of the good;

(2) The value of the non-originating materials described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is included in the value of non-originating materials for any applicable regional value content requirement for the good under General Note 28(n), HTSUS; and

(3) The good meets all other applicable requirements of General Note 28, HTSUS.

(b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to:

(1) A non-originating material provided for in Chapter 4, HTSUS, or in subheading 1901.90, HTSUS, that is used in the production of a good provided for in Chapter 4, HTSUS;

(2) A non-originating material provided for in Chapter 4, HTSUS, or in subheading 1901.90, HTSUS, that is used in the production of a good provided for in one of the following HTSUS provisions: subheading 1901.10, 1901.20 or 1901.90; heading 2105; or subheading 2106.90, 2202.90 or 2309.90;

(3) A non-originating material provided for in heading 0805, HTSUS, or subheadings 2009.11 through 2009.39, HTSUS, that is used in the production of a good provided for in subheadings 2009.11 through 2009.39, HTSUS, or in subheading 2106.90 or 2202.90, HTSUS;

(4) A non-originating material provided for in Chapter 15, HTSUS, that is used in the production of a good provided for in headings 1501 through 1508, 1512, 1514 or 1515, HTSUS;

(5) A non-originating material provided for in heading 1701, HTSUS, that is used in the production of a good provided for in headings 1701 through 1703, HTSUS;

(6) A non-originating material provided for in Chapter 17, HTSUS, or heading 1805, HTSUS, that is used in the production of a good provided for in subheading 1806.10, HTSUS;

(7) A non-originating material provided for in headings 2203 through 2208, HTSUS, that is used in the production of a good provided for in heading 2207 or 2208, HTSUS; or

(8) A non-originating material used in the production of a good provided for in Chapters 1 through 21, HTSUS, unless the non-originating material is provided for in a different subheading than the good for which origin is being determined.

(c) A textile or apparel good provided for in Chapters 42, 50 through 63, 70, or 94, HTSUS, that is not an originating good because certain fibers or yarns used in the production of the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in General Note 28(n), HTSUS, will nevertheless be considered to be an originating good if the total weight of all such fibers or yarns in that component is not more than 7 percent of the total weight of that component. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a textile or apparel good containing elastomeric yarns in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good will be considered an originating good only if such yarns are wholly formed in the territory of a Party. For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of a textile or apparel good that is a yarn, fabric, or group of fibers, the term "component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good" means all of the fibers in the yarn, fabric, or group of fibers.
