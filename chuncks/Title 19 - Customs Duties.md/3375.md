### PART 111 - CUSTOMS BROKERS
#### Subpart D - Cancellation, Suspension, or Revocation of License or Permit, and Monetary Penalty in Lieu of Suspension or Revocation
##### § 111.61 Decision on preliminary proceedings.

The processing Center will prepare a summary of any oral presentations made by the broker or the broker's attorney and forward it to the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, together with a copy of each paper filed by the broker. The processing Center will also give to the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, a recommendation on action to be taken as a result of the preliminary proceedings. If the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, determines that the broker has satisfactorily responded to the proposed charges and that further proceedings are not warranted, he or she will so inform the processing Center, who will notify the broker. If no response is filed by the broker or if the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, determines that the broker has not satisfactorily responded to all of the proposed charges, he or she will advise the processing Center of that fact and instruct the processing Center to prepare, sign, and serve a notice of charges and the statement of charges. If one or more of the charges in the proposed statement of charges was satisfactorily answered by the broker in the preliminary proceedings, the appropriate Executive Director, Office of Trade, will instruct the processing Center to omit those charges from the statement of charges.
