##### § 200.735-107 Financial interests.

(a) An employee shall not:

(2) Engage in, directly or indirectly, a financial transaction as a result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through his Government employment.

(b) This section does not preclude an employee from having a financial interest or engaging in financial transactions to the same extent as a private citizen not employed by the Government so long as it is not prohibited by law, the Executive order, or this part.

(c) Pursuant to the authority contained in 18 U.S.C. 208(b), the following types of financial interests are considered too remote or inconsequential to affect a Commission employee's integrity or services and do not constitute a conflict of interest under 18 U.S.C. 208(a):

(1) In widely-held, diversified mutual funds or regulated investment companies, regardless of their value; and

(2) In state or local government bonds, or other noncorporate bonds, regardless of their value.
