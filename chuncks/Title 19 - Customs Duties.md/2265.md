The merchandise may not be moved, stored, or otherwise disposed of until the notice of arrival, or its electronic equivalent, has been submitted and release for the intended purpose has been authorized by an inspector of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs.

(b) Where plant or plant products are shipped from the port of first arrival to another port or place for inspection or other treatment by a representative of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs and all CBP requirements for the release of the merchandise have been met, the merchandise must be forwarded as an in-bond shipment pursuant to part 18 of this chapter to the representative of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine Programs at the place at which the inspection or other treatment is to take place. No further release by the port director will be required.
