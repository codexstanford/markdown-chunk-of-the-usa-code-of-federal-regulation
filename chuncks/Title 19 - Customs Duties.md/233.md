The procedure in the last two sentences of § 10.6 shall be applicable.

(e) If claim for exemption from duty for such containers or holders of foreign production previously imported duty paid is made at the time of entry, the certificate of the foreign shipper may be accepted if produced at any time prior to the liquidation of the entry.

(f) When such containers or holders of foreign production previously imported duty paid are reimported empty, they may be admitted without entry if readily identifiable as having been previously imported duty paid.
