(a) Samples accompanying a commercial traveler who presents an adequate descriptive list or a special CBP invoice, and professional equipment, tools of trade, and repair components for such equipment or tools imported in his baggage for his own use by a nonresident sojourning temporarily in the United States may be entered on the importer's baggage declaration in lieu of formal entry and examination and may be passed under subheadings 9813.00.20 or 9813.00.50, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, (HTSUS), at the place of arrival in the same manner as other passengers' baggage. The examination may be made by an inspector who is qualified, in the opinion of the port director, to determine the amount of the bond required by § 10.31(c) to be filed in support of the entry. If the articles are a commercial traveler's samples and exceed $500 in value, a special Customs invoice or a descriptive list shall be furnished.

(b) When the proprietor or manager of a theatrical exhibition arriving from abroad who has entered his scenery, properties, and apparel under subheading 9817.00.98, HTSUS, contemplates side trips to a contiguous country with the exhibition within the period of time during which the merchandise may remain in the customs territory of the United States under bond, including any lawful extension, a copy of the entry covering the effects and a copy of a descriptive list of such effects or invoice furnished by him may be certified by the examining officer and returned to the proprietor or manager for use in registering the effects with the CBP officers at the port of exit, and in clearing them through CBP on his return. Cancellation of the bond shall be effected by exportation in accordance with the provisions of § 10.38 at the time the theatrical effects are finally taken out of the United States before the expiration of the period of time during which the merchandise may remain in the customs territory of the United States under bond, including any lawful extension. Similar treatment may be accorded articles entered under other subheadings in chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS, upon approval by Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

(c) When a commercial traveler contemplates side trips to a contiguous country within the period of time during which the merchandise may remain in the customs territory of the United States under bond, including any lawful extension, a copy of his baggage declaration and a copy of the descriptive list or special CBP invoice furnished by him may be certified by the examining officer and returned to the traveler for use in registering the samples with CBP officers at the port of exit, and in clearing them through CBP upon his return. Cancellation of the bond shall be effected by exportation in accordance with the provisions of § 10.38 at the time the samples are finally taken out of the United States before the expiration of the period of time during which the merchandise may remain in the customs territory of the United States under bond, including any lawful extension.

(d) The privilege of clearance of commercial travelers' samples or professional equipment, tools of trade, and repair components for such equipment or tools imported for his own use by a nonresident sojourning temporarily in the United States on a baggage declaration under bond without surety or cash deposit shall not be accorded to a commercial traveler or such nonresident who, through fraud or culpable negligence, has failed to comply with the provisions of such a bond in connection with a prior arrival.
