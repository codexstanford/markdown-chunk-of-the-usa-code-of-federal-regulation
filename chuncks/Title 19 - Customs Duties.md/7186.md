#### Subpart C - Review and Disposition of Protests
##### § 174.23 Further review of protests.

A protesting party may seek further review of a protest in lieu of review by the Center director by filing, on the form prescribed in § 174.25, an application for such review within the time allowed and in the manner prescribed by § 174.12 for the filing of a protest. The filing of an application for further review shall not preclude a preliminary examination by the Center director for the purpose of determining whether the protest may be allowed in full. If such preliminary examination indicates that the protest would be denied in whole or in part by the Center director in the absence of an application for further review; however, he shall forward the protest and application for consideration in accordance with § 174.26.
