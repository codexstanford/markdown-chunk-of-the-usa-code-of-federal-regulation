Imported salt in bond may be used in curing fish taken by vessels licensed to engage in the fisheries, and in curing fish in the shores of the navigable waters of the U.S., whether such fish are taken by licensed or unlicensed vessels, and upon proof that the sale has been used for either of such purposes, the duties on the same shall be remitted. (Section 313(e), Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1313(e)). Imported salt entered for warehouse may be withdrawn under bond for use in curing fish. Upon proof that the salt has been so used, the duties thereon shall be remitted. In no case shall the quantity of salt withdrawn exceed the reasonable requirements of the case. Withdrawal shall be made on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent. Each withdrawal shall contain the statement prescribed for withdrawals in § 144.32 of this chapter.

Upon acceptance of the bond, a withdrawal permit shall be issued on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent.
