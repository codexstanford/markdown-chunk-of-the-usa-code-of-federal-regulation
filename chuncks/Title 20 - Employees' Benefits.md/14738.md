### PART 680 - ADULT AND DISLOCATED WORKER ACTIVITIES UNDER TITLE I OF THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT
#### Subpart C - Individual Training Accounts
##### § 680.310 Can the duration and amount of Individual Training Accounts be limited?

(a) Yes, the State or Local WDB may impose limits on ITAs, such as limitations on the dollar amount and/or duration.

(b) Limits to ITAs may be established in different ways:

(1) There may be a limit for an individual participant that is based on the needs identified in the IEP, such as the participant's occupational choice or goal and the level of training needed to succeed in that goal; or

(2) There may be a policy decision by the State WDB or Local WDB to establish a range of amounts and/or a maximum amount applicable to all ITAs.

(c) Limitations established by State or Local WDB policies must be described in the State or Local Plan, respectively, but must not be implemented in a manner that undermines WIOA's requirement that training services are provided in a manner that maximizes customer choice in the selection of an ETP. Exceptions to ITA limitations may be provided for individual cases and must be described in State or Local WDB policies.

(d) An individual may select training that costs more than the maximum amount available for ITAs under a State or local policy when other sources of funds are available to supplement the ITA. These other sources may include: Pell Grants; scholarships; severance pay; and other sources.
