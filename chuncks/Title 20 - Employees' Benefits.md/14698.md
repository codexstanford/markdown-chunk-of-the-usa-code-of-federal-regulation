(2) Apply job-driven strategies in the one-stop delivery system;

(3) Enable economic, education, and workforce partners to build a skilled workforce through innovation in, and alignment of, employment, training, and education programs; and

(4) Incorporate the local plan into the regional plan per § 679.540.

(b) In the case of planning regions, a regional plan is required to meet the purposes described in paragraph (a) of this section and to coordinate resources among multiple WDBs in a region.

(c) The Governor must establish and disseminate to Local WDBs and regional planning areas a policy for the submission of local and regional plans. The policy must set a deadline for the submission of the regional and local plans that accounts for the activities required in plan development outlined in §§ 679.510 and 679.550.
