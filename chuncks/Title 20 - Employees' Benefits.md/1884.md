###### § 234.13 Payment to a funeral home.

The 1937 Act LSDP is paid to a funeral home under the following conditions:

(a) A person who has assumed responsibility for all or part of the burial expenses files an application authorizing payment to the funeral home. Usually, the Board considers the person who makes the arrangements with the funeral home or makes a voluntary payment to the funeral home to be the person who has assumed responsibility for the burial expenses.

(b) An official of the funeral home with unpaid expenses files an application on behalf of the funeral home after 90 days have elapsed from the date of the employee's death, if during that 90-day period no one has assumed responsibility for the payment of the burial expenses.
