####### § 10.510 When may a light duty job form the basis of a loss of wage-earning capacity determination?
######## i.e.,

A light-duty position that fairly and reasonably represents an employee's ability to earn wages may form the basis of a loss of wage-earning capacity determination if that light duty position is a classified position to which the injured employee has been formally reassigned. The position must conform to the established physical limitations of the injured employee; the employer must have a written position description outlining the duties and physical requirements; and the position must correlate to the type of appointment held by the injured employee at the time of injury. If these circumstances are present, a determination may be made that the position constitutes "regular" Federal employment. In the absence of a "light-duty position" as described in this paragraph, OWCP will assume that the employee was instead engaged in non-competitive, makeshift or odd lot employment which does not represent the employee's wage-earning capacity,work of the type provided to injured employees who cannot otherwise be employed by the Federal Government or in any well-known branch of the general labor market.
