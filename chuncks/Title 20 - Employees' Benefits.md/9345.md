###### § 416.2227 Resolution of disputes.
####### Disputes on determinations made by the Commissioner which affect a disabled or blind beneficiary's rights to benefits.

(c)Determinations made by the Commissioner which affect an individual's right to benefits (e.g., determinations that disability or blindness benefits should be terminated, denied, suspended, continued or begun at a different date than alleged) cannot be appealed by a State VR agency. Because these determinations are an integral part of the disability or blindness benefits claims process, they can only be appealed by the beneficiary or applicant whose rights are affected or by his or her authorized representative. However, if an appeal of an unfavorable determination is made by the individual and is successful, the new determination would also apply for purposes of this subpart. While a VR agency cannot appeal a determination made by the Commissioner which affects a beneficiary's or applicant's rights, the VR agency can furnish any evidence it may have which would support a revision of a determination.
