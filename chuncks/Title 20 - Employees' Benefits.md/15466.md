####### § 702.337 Formal hearings; change of time or place for hearings; postponements.

(a) Except for good cause shown, hearings shall be held at convenient locations not more than 75 miles from the claimant's residence.

(b) Once a formal hearing has been scheduled, continuances shall not be granted except in cases of extreme hardship or where attendance of a party or his or her representative is mandated at a previously scheduled judicial proceeding. Unless the ground for the request arises thereafter, requests for continuances must be received by the Chief Administrative Law Judge at least 10 days before the scheduled hearing date, must be served upon the other parties and must specify the extreme hardship or previously scheduled judicial proceeding claimed.

(c) The Chief Administrative Law Judge or the administrative law judge assigned to the case may change the time and place of the hearing, or temporarily adjourn a hearing, on his own motion or for good cause shown by a party. The parties shall be given not less than 10 days' notice of the new time and place of the hearing, unless they agree to such change without notice.
