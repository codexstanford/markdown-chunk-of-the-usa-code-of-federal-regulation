#### Subpart D - Performance Indicators
##### § 672.405 What are the required levels of performance for the performance indicators?

(a) Expected levels of performance for each of the common performance indicators are national standards that are provided in separately issued guidance. Short-term or other performance indicators will be provided in separately issued guidance or as part of the SGA or grant agreement. Performance level expectations are based on available YouthBuild data and data from similar WIA Youth programs and may change between grant competitions. The expected national levels of performance will take into account the extent to which the levels promote continuous improvement in performance.

(b) The levels of performance established will, at a minimum:

(1) Be expressed in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form; and

(2) Indicate continuous improvement in performance.
