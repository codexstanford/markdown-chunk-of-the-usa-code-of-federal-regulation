###### § 418.3615 Will we mail you a notice of the initial determination?

(a) We will mail a written notice of the initial determination to you at your last known address. Generally, we will not send a notice if your premium subsidy stops because of your death or if the initial determination is a redetermination that your eligibility for a subsidy and the amount of your subsidy has not changed.

(b) The written notice that we send will tell you:

(1) What our initial determination is;

(2) The reasons for our determination; and

(3) The effect of our determination on your right to further review.

(c) We will mail you a written notice before increasing, reducing, or terminating your subsidy. The notice will tell you the first month that we plan to make the change and give you appeal rights. Your appeal rights for a reduction or termination will include the right to continue to receive your subsidy at the previously established level until there is a decision on your appeal request if your appeal is filed within 10 days after you receive our notice.
