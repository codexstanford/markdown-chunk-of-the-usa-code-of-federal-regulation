#### Subpart C - Applying Priority of Service
##### § 1010.300 What processes are to be implemented to identify covered persons?

(a) Recipients of funds for qualified job training programs must implement processes to identify covered persons who physically access service delivery points or who access virtual service delivery programs or Web sites in order to provide covered persons with timely and useful information on priority of service at the point of entry. Point of entry may include reception through a One-Stop Career Center established pursuant to the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as part of an application process for a specific program, or through any other method by which covered persons express an interest in receiving services, either in-person or virtually.

(b)(1) The processes for identifying covered persons at the point of entry must be designed to:

(i) Permit the individual to make known his or her covered person status; and

(ii) Permit those qualified job training programs specified in § 1010.330(a)(2) to initiate data collection for covered entrants.

(2) The processes for identifying covered persons are not required to verify the status of an individual as a veteran or eligible spouse at the point of entry unless they immediately undergo eligibility determination and enrollment in a program.

(c) The processes for identifying covered persons must ensure that:

(1) Covered persons are identified at the point of entry to allow covered persons to take full advantage of priority of service; and

(2) Covered persons are to be made aware of:

(i) Their entitlement to priority of service;

(ii) The full array of employment, training, and placement services available under priority of service; and

(iii) Any applicable eligibility requirements for those programs and/or services.
