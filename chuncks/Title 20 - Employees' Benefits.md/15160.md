##### § 686.340 How are entities selected to receive funding to provide outreach and admission, career transition and other operations support services?

(a) The Secretary selects eligible entities to provide outreach and admission, career transition, and operational services on a competitive basis in accordance with applicable statutes and regulations. In selecting an entity, the Secretary issues requests for proposals (RFP) for operational support services according to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1) and Department of Labor Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 29). The Secretary develops RFPs for operational support services in consultation with the Governor, the center workforce council (if established), and the Local WDB for the workforce development area in which the center is located.

(b) The RFP for each support service contract describes uniform specifications and standards, as well as specifications and requirements that are unique to the specific required operational support services.

(c) The contracting officer selects and funds operational support service contracts on the basis of an evaluation of the proposals received using criteria established by the Secretary and set forth in the RFP. The criteria may include the following, as applicable:

(1) The ability of the offeror to coordinate the activities carried out in relation to the Job Corps center with related activities carried out under the appropriate State Plan and local plans;

(2) The ability of the entity to offer career technical training that has been proposed by the workforce council and the degree to which the training reflects employment opportunities in the local areas in which most of the students intend to seek employment;

(3) The degree to which the offeror demonstrates relationships with the surrounding communities, including employers, labor organizations, State WDBs, Local WDBs, applicable one-stop centers, and the State and region in which the services are provided;

(4) The offeror's past performance, if any, relating to providing services to a Job Corps center, including information regarding the offeror in any reports developed by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Labor and the offeror's demonstrated effectiveness in assisting individuals in achieving the indicators of performance for eligible youth described in sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA, listed in § 686.1010;

(5) The offeror's ability to demonstrate a record of successfully assisting at-risk youth to connect to the workforce; and
