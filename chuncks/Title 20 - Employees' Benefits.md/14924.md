##### § 683.280 What health and safety standards apply to the working conditions of participants in activities under title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

(a) Health and safety standards established under Federal and State law otherwise applicable to working conditions of employees are equally applicable to working conditions of participants engaged in programs and activities under title I of WIOA.

(b)(1) To the extent that a State workers' compensation law applies, workers' compensation must be provided to participants in programs and activities under title I of WIOA on the same basis as the compensation is provided to other individuals in the State in similar employment.

(2) If a State workers' compensation law applies to a participant in work experience, workers' compensation benefits must be available for injuries suffered by the participant in such work experience. If a State workers' compensation law does not apply to a participant in work experience, insurance coverage must be secured for injuries suffered by the participant in the course of such work experience.
