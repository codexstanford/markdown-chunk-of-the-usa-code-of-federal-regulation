###### Survivors
####### § 30.502 When is entitlement for survivors determined for purposes of EEOICPA?

Entitlement to any lump-sum payment for survivors under the EEOICPA, other than for "covered" children under Part E, will be determined as of the time OWCP makes such a payment. As noted in § 30.500(c)(1), a child of a deceased Part E employee will only qualify as a "covered" child of that individual if he or she satisfied one of the additional statutory criteria for a "covered" child as of the date of the deceased Part E employee's death.
