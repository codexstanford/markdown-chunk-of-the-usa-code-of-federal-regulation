###### § 404.1930 Disclosure of information.

The use of information furnished under an agreement generally shall be governed by the national statutes on confidentiality and disclosure of information of the country that has been furnished the information. (The U.S. will be governed by pertinent provisions of the Social Security Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Tax Reform Act, and other related statutes.) In negotiating an agreement, consideration, should be given to the compatibility of the other country's laws on confidentiality and disclosure to those of the U.S. To the extent possible, information exchanged between the U.S. and the foreign country should be used exclusively for purposes of implementing the agreement and the laws to which the agreement pertains.
