#### PART 363 - GARNISHMENT OF REMUNERATION OF BOARD PERSONNEL
##### § 363.1 Authorization for garnishment of remuneration for employment paid by the Board.

(a) Remuneration for employment paid or payable by the Board is subject, in like manner and to the same extent as if the Board were a private person, to legal process brought for the enforcement of legal obligations to provide child support or to make alimony payments.

(b) Remuneration for employment includes compensation paid or payable for personal services, whether such compensation is denominated as wages, salary, commission, bonus, pay, or otherwise, and includes, but is not limited to, severance pay, sick pay, and incentive pay, but does not include awards for making suggestions.

(c) Remuneration for employment does not include:

(1) Amounts required by law to be deducted, including but not limited to Federal employment taxes and civil service retirement contributions;

(2) Amounts which are deducted as health insurance premiums;

(3) Amounts which are deducted as premiums for regular life insurance coverage; and

(4) Amounts which are properly withheld for Federal, state, or local income tax purposes, if the withholding of such amounts is authorized or required by law and if amounts withheld are not greater than would be the case if the individual concerned claimed all dependents to which he was entitled (the withholding of additional amounts pursuant to section 3402(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 may be permitted only when such individual presents evidence of a tax obligation which supports the additional withholding).
