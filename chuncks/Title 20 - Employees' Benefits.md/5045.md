###### § 404.1594 How we will determine whether your disability continues or ends.
####### You fail to follow prescribed treatment which would be expected to restore your ability to engage in substantial gainful activity.

(4)If treatment has been prescribed for you which would be expected to restore your ability to work, you must follow that treatment in order to be paid benefits. If you are not following that treatment and you do not have good cause for failing to follow that treatment, we will find that your disability has ended (see § 404.1530(c)). The month your disability ends will be the first month in which you failed to follow the prescribed treatment.
