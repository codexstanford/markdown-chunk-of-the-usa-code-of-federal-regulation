(2) A minor child or incompetent is entitled to an annuity or lump-sum payment and a guardian, trustee, committee, or conservator has been appointed to act in his or her behalf.

(b) The Board will require evidence of an annuitant's earnings when the information that he or she furnished the Board does not agree with the earnings data furnished by the Social Security Administration or secured from other sources, and the annuitant maintains that the earnings data from the Social Security Administration or from other sources is not correct.

(c) The Board will require evidence to establish the amounts paid as a public service pension, public disability benefit, or worker's compensation to an employee, spouse, widow, or widower when the pension, public disability benefit, or worker's compensation affects the amount of his or her annuity.
