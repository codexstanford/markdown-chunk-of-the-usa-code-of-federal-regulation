##### Notice of Appeal
###### § 802.205 Time for filing.

(a) A notice of appeal, other than a cross-appeal, must be filed within 30 days from the date upon which a decision or order has been filed in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner pursuant to section 19(e) of the LHWCA or in such other office as may be established in the future (see §§ 702.349 and 725.478 of this title).

(b) If a timely notice of appeal is filed by a party, any other party may initiate a cross-appeal by filing a notice of appeal within 14 days of the date on which the first notice of appeal was filed, or within the time prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section, whichever period last expires. In the event that such other party was not properly served with the first notice of appeal, such party may initiate a cross-appeal by filing a notice of appeal within 14 days of the date that service is effected.

(c) Failure to file within the period specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section (whichever is applicable) shall foreclose all rights to review by the Board with respect to the case or matter in question. Any untimely appeal will be summarily dismissed by the Board for lack of jurisdiction.
