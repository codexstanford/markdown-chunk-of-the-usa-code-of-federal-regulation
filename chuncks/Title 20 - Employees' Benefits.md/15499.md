###### Debarment of Physicians and Other Providers of Medical Services and Suppliers and Claims Representatives
####### § 702.436 Reinstatement.

(a) If a physician or health care provider has been debarred or pursuant to § 702.431(d) or if a claims representative has been debarred pursuant to § 702.131(c) (1) or (3) the person debarred will be automatically reinstated upon notice to the Director that the conviction or exclusion has been reversed or withdrawn. However, such reinstatement will not preclude the Director from instituting debarment proceedings based upon the subject matter involved.

(b) A physician, health care provider or claims representative otherwise debarred by the Director may apply for reinstatement to participate in the program by application to the Director after three years from the date of entry of the order of exclusion. Such application for reinstatement shall be addressed to the Associate Director for the Longshore program, and shall contain a statement of the basis of the application along with any supporting documentation.

(c) The Director may further investigate the merits of the reinstatement application by requiring special reporting procedures from the applicant for a probationary period not to exceed six months to be monitored by the district office where the provider maintains a place of business.

(d) At the end of aforesaid probationary period, the Director may order full reinstatement of the physician, health care provider or claims representative if such reinstatement is clearly consistent with the program goal to protect itself against fraud and abuse and, further, if the physician, health care provider or claims representative has given reasonable assurances that the basis for the debarment will not be repeated.
