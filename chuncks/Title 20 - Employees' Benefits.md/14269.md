##### § 668.750 Under what circumstances can we or the INA grantee modify the terms of the grantee's plan(s)?

(a) We may unilaterally modify the INA grantee's plan to add funds or, if required by Congressional action, to reduce the amount of funds available for expenditure.

(b) The INA grantee may request approval to modify its plan to add, expand, delete, or diminish any service allowable under the regulations in this part. The INA grantee may modify its plan without our approval, unless the modification reduces the total number of participants to be served annually under the grantee's program by a number which exceeds 25 percent of the participants previously proposed to be served, or by 25 participants, whichever is larger.

(c) We will act upon any modification within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the proposed modification. In the event that further clarification or modification is required, we may extend the thirty (30) day time frame to conclude appropriate negotiations.
