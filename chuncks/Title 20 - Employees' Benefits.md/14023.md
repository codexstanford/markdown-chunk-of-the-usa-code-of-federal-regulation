##### § 663.430 Under what circumstances may mechanisms other than ITA's be used to provide training services?

(a) Contracts for services may be used instead of ITA's only when one of the following three exceptions applies:

(1) When the services provided are on-the-job training (OJT) or customized training;

(2) When the Local Board determines that there are an insufficient number of eligible providers in the local area to accomplish the purpose of a system of ITA's. The Local Plan must describe the process to be used in selecting the providers under a contract for services. This process must include a public comment period for interested providers of at least 30 days;

(3) When the Local Board determines that there is a training services program of demonstrated effectiveness offered in the area by a community-based organization (CBO) or another private organization to serve special participant populations that face multiple barriers to employment, as described in paragraph (b) in this section. The Local Board must develop criteria to be used in determining demonstrated effectiveness, particularly as it applies to the special participant population to be served. The criteria may include:

(i) Financial stability of the organization;

(ii) Demonstrated performance in the delivery of services to hard to serve participant populations through such means as program completion rate; attainment of the skills, certificates or degrees the program is designed to provide; placement after training in unsubsidized employment; and retention in employment; and

(iii) How the specific program relates to the workforce investment needs identified in the local plan.

(b) Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, special participant populations that face multiple barriers to employment are populations of low-income individuals that are included in one or more of the following categories:

(1) Individuals with substantial language or cultural barriers;

(2) Offenders;

(3) Homeless individuals; and

(4) Other hard-to-serve populations as defined by the Governor.
