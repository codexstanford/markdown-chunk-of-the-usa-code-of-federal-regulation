Every applicant for the authority to write insurance under the provisions of this Act, will be deemed to have included in its application an agreement that the acceptance by DLHWC of a report of insurance, as provided for by § 703.116, binds the carrier to full liability for the obligations under this Act of the employer named in said report, and every certificate of authority to write insurance under this Act will be deemed to have been issued by the Office upon consideration of the carrier's agreement to become so bound. It will be no defense to this agreement that the carrier failed or delayed to issue the policy to the employer covered by this report.
