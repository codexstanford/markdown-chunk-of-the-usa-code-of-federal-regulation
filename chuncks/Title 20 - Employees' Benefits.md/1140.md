A person who applies for a spouse's, widow's or widower's, or surviving divorced spouse's annuity on the basis of caring for a child, or for an increase under the social security overall minimum guaranty provision based on caring for a child, is required to furnish evidence that he or she has in care an eligible child of the employee as described in part 222 of this chapter.
