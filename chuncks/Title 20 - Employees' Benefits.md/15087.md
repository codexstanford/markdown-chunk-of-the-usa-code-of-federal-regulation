#### Subpart B - The Service Delivery System for the National Farmworker Jobs Program
##### § 685.210 How does an eligible entity become a grantee?

To become a grantee and receive a grant under this subpart, an applicant must respond to a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Under the FOA, grantees will be selected using standard Federal government competitive procedures. The entity's proposal must include a program plan, which is a 4-year strategy for meeting the needs of eligible MSFWs in the proposed service area, and a description of the entities experience working with the broader workforce delivery system. Unless specified otherwise in the FOA, grantees may serve eligible MSFWs, including eligible MSFW youth, under the grant. An applicant whose application for funding as a grantee under this section is denied in whole or in part may request an administrative review under § 683.800 of this chapter.
