##### § 681.400 What is the process used to select eligible youth service providers?

(a) The grant recipient/fiscal agent has the option to provide directly some or all of the youth workforce investment activities.

(b) However, as provided in WIOA sec. 123, if a Local WDB chooses to award grants or contracts to youth service providers to carry out some or all of the youth workforce investment activities, the Local WDB must award such grants or contracts on a competitive basis, subject to the exception explained in paragraph (b)(4) of this section:

(1) The Local WDB must identify youth service providers based on criteria established in the State Plan (including such quality criteria established by the Governor for a training program that leads to a recognized postsecondary credential) and take into consideration the ability of the provider to meet performance accountability measures based on the primary indicators of performance for youth programs.

(2) The Local WDB must procure the youth service providers in accordance with the Uniform Guidance at 2 CFR parts 200 and 2900, in addition to applicable State and local procurement laws.

(3) If the Local WDB establishes a standing youth committee under § 681.100 it may assign the committee the function of selecting of grants or contracts.

(4) Where the Local WDB determines there are an insufficient number of eligible youth providers in the local area, such as a rural area, the Local WDB may award grants or contracts on a sole source basis.
