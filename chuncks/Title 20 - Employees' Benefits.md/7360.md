##### § 411.510 How is the State VR agency paid under the Ticket to Work program?

(a) The State VR agency's payment choices are described in § 411.355.

(b) The State VR agency's decision to serve the beneficiary must be communicated to the program manager (PM). (See § 411.115(k) for a definition of the PM.) At the same time, the State VR agency must notify the PM of its selected payment system for that beneficiary.

(c) If a beneficiary who is receiving services from the State VR agency under an existing IPE becomes eligible for a ticket that is available for assignment, the State VR agency is limited to the cost reimbursement payment system, unless both the beneficiary and the State VR agency agree to have the ticket assigned to the State VR agency (see § 411.390).
