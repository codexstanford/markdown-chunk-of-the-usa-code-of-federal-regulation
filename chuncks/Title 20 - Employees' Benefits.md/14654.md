(c) Identification of all one-stop partners, chief elected officials, and Local WDB participating in the infrastructure funding arrangement.

(d) Steps the Local WDB, chief elected officials, and one-stop partners used to reach consensus or an assurance that the local area followed the guidance for the State funding process.

(e) Description of the process to be used among partners to resolve issues during the MOU duration period when consensus cannot be reached.
