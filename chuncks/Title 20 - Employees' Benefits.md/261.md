###### Exclusion of Providers
####### § 10.819 What requirements must the provider's answer and OWCP's decision meet?

(a) The provider's answer shall be in writing and shall include an answer to OWCP's invitation to resign voluntarily. If the provider does not offer to resign, he or she shall request that a determination be made upon the existing record and any additional information provided.

(b) Should the provider fail to answer the letter of intent within 60 days of receipt, the deciding official may deem the allegations made therein to be true and may order exclusion of the provider.

(c) The provider may inspect or request copies of information in the record at any time prior to the deciding official's decision by making such request to OWCP within 20 days of receipt of the letter of intent.

(d) Any response from the provider will be forwarded to DOL OIG, which shall have 30 days to answer the provider's response. That answer will be forwarded to the provider, who shall then have 15 days to reply.

(e) The deciding official shall be the Regional Director in the region in which the provider is located unless otherwise specified by the Director of the Division of Federal Employees' Compensation.

(f) The deciding official shall issue his or her decision in writing, and shall send a copy of the decision to the provider by certified mail, return receipt requested (or equivalent service from a commercial carrier). The decision shall advise the provider of his or her right to request, within 30 days of the date of an adverse decision, a formal hearing before an administrative law judge under the procedures set forth in §§ 10.820 through 10.823. The filing of a request for a hearing within the time specified shall stay the effectiveness of the decision to exclude.
