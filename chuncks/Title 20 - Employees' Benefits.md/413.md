###### Eligibility Criteria for Claims Relating to Chronic Silicosis Under Part B of EEOICPA
####### § 30.222 How does a claimant establish that the employee has been diagnosed with chronic silicosis or has sustained a consequential injury, illness, impairment or disease?

(a) A written diagnosis of the employee's chronic silicosis (as defined in § 30.5(k)) shall be made by a licensed physician and accompanied by one of the following:

(1) A chest radiograph, interpreted by an individual certified by NIOSH as a B reader, classifying the existence of pneumoconioses of category 1/0 or higher; or

(2) Results from a computer assisted tomograph or other imaging technique that are consistent with silicosis; or

(3) Lung biopsy findings consistent with silicosis.

(b) An injury, illness, impairment or disease sustained as a consequence of accepted chronic silicosis covered by the provisions of § 30.220(a) must be established with a fully rationalized medical report by a physician that shows the relationship between the injury, illness, impairment or disease and the accepted chronic silicosis. Neither the fact that the injury, illness, impairment or disease manifests itself after a diagnosis of accepted chronic silicosis, nor the belief of the claimant that the injury, illness, impairment or disease was caused by the accepted chronic silicosis, is sufficient in itself to prove a causal relationship.
