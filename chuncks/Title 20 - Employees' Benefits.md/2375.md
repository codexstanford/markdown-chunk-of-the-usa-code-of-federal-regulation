### Subchapter C - Regulations Under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act
#### PART 341 - STATUTORY LIEN WHERE SICKNESS BENEFITS PAID
##### § 341.6 Report of settlement or judgment.

(a) When a person or company makes a settlement or must satisfy a final judgment based on an injury for which the employee received sickness benefits, the person or company shall notify the Board of the settlement or final judgment. That notice shall be in writing and submitted within five days of the settlement or final judgment. A railroad employer may fulfill the written notice requirement by sending an electronic message in the manner prescribed by the agency. That notification shall contain:

(1) The amount of the settlement or final judgment;

(2) The date of the settlement or final judgment; and

(3) The amount withheld from the settlement or final judgment to satisfy the Board's lien.

(b) Payment of the amount due the Board shall be delivered to the Board within 30 days after the date of the settlement agreement or the entry of final judgment.

(c) If the damages payable are to be paid directly to the court to satisfy a final judgment, thus making it impossible for the person or company to remit the amount of reimbursement due the Board, the person or company shall immediately notify the Board of the situation.
