(a) Section 188(a)(3) of WIOA prohibits the use of funds to employ participants to carry out the construction, operation, or maintenance of any part of any facility used for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship with the exception of maintenance of facilities that are not primarily used for instruction or worship and are operated by organizations providing services to WIOA participants.

(b) 29 CFR part 2, subpart D, governs the circumstances under which Department support, including WIOA title I financial assistance, may be used to employ or train participants in religious activities. Under that subpart, such assistance may be used for such employment or training only when the assistance is provided indirectly within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution, and not when the assistance is provided directly. That subpart also contains requirements related to equal treatment in Department of Labor programs for religious organizations, and to protecting the religious liberty of Department of Labor social service providers and beneficiaries. (29 CFR part 2, subpart D-Equal Treatment in Department of Labor Programs for Religious Organizations, Protection of Religious Liberty of Department of Labor Social Service Providers and Beneficiaries).
