###### § 234.31 Regular employee retirement and supplemental annuities.

A regular employee retirement annuity or a supplemental annuity which is unpaid at the death of the employee is payable in the following order and amounts:

(a) A surviving spouse, who was "living with" (see § 234.21) the employee at the time of the employee's death, receives the full amount of the unpaid annuity.

(b) Each person who paid the employee's burial expenses receives a share of the unpaid annuities in the same proportion that he or she paid the burial expenses, but only to the extent that he or she is not reimbursed by the LSDP. If a payer of the employee's burial expenses dies before negotiating his or her check, that payment becomes payable to his or her estate.

(c) Surviving children of the employee receive equal shares.

(d) Surviving grandchildren of the employee receive equal shares.

(e) Surviving parents of the employee each receive equal shares.

(f) Surviving brothers and sisters of the employee receive equal shares. Half blood brothers and sisters share equally with full blood brothers and sisters.
