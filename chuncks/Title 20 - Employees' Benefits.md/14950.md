##### § 683.500 What is a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Pay-for-Performance contract strategy?

(a) A WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy is a specific type of performance-based contract strategy that has four distinct characteristics:

(1) It is a strategy to use WIOA Pay-for-Performance contracts as they are described in § 683.510;

(2) It must include the identification of the workforce development problem and target populations for which a local area will pursue a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy; the outcomes the local area would hope to achieve through a Pay-for-Performance contract relative to baseline performance; and the acceptable cost to government associated with achieving these outcomes;

(3) It must include a strategy for independently validating the performance outcomes achieved under each contract within the strategy prior to payment occurring; and

(4) It must include a description of how the State or local area will reallocate funds to other activities under the contract strategy in the event a service provider does not achieve performance benchmarks under a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract.

(b) Prior to the implementation of a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy, a local area must conduct a feasibility study to determine whether the intervention is suitable for a WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy.

(c) The WIOA Pay-for-Performance contract strategy must be developed in accordance with guidance issued by the Secretary.
