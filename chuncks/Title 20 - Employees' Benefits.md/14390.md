##### § 670.410 Are there additional factors which are considered in selecting an eligible applicant for enrollment?

Yes, in accordance with procedures issued by the Secretary, an eligible applicant may be selected for enrollment, only if:

(a) A determination is made, based on information relating to the background, needs and interests of the applicant, that the applicant's educational and vocational needs can best be met through the Job Corps program;

(b) A determination is made that there is a reasonable expectation the applicant can participate successfully in group situations and activities, and is not likely to engage in actions that would potentially:

(1) Prevent other students from receiving the benefit of the program;

(2) Be incompatible with the maintenance of sound discipline; or

(3) Impede satisfactory relationships between the center to which the student is assigned and surrounding local communities;

(c) The applicant is made aware of the center's rules and what the consequences are for failure to observe the rules, as described in procedures issued by the Secretary;

(d) The applicant passes a background check conducted according to procedures established by the Secretary. The background check must find that the applicant is not on probation, parole, under a suspended sentence or under the supervision of any agency as a result of court action or institutionalization, unless the court or appropriate agency certifies in writing that it will approve of the applicant's release from its supervision and that the applicant's release does not violate applicable laws and regulations. No one will be denied enrollment in Job Corps solely on the basis of contact with the criminal justice system. (WIA secs. 145(b)(1)(C) and 145(b)(2));

(e) Suitable arrangements are made for the care of any dependent children for the proposed period of enrollment.
