### PART 663 - ADULT AND DISLOCATED WORKER ACTIVITIES UNDER TITLE I OF THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT
#### Subpart D - Individual Training Accounts
##### § 663.420 Can the duration and amount of ITA's be limited?

(a) Yes, the State or Local Board may impose limits on ITA's, such as limitations on the dollar amount and/or duration.

(b) Limits to ITA's may be established in different ways:

(1) There may be a limit for an individual participant that is based on the needs identified in the individual employment plan; or

(2) There may be a policy decision by the State Board or Local Board to establish a range of amounts and/or a maximum amount applicable to all ITA's.

(c) Limitations established by State or Local Board policies must be described in the State or Local Plan, respectively, but should not be implemented in a manner that undermines the Act's requirement that training services are provided in a manner that maximizes customer choice in the selection of an eligible training provider. ITA limitations may provide for exceptions to the limitations in individual cases.

(d) An individual may select training that costs more than the maximum amount available for ITAs under a State or local policy when other sources of funds are available to supplement the ITA. These other sources may include: Pell Grants; scholarships; severance pay; and other sources.
