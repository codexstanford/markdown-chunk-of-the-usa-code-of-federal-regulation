### PART 1010 - APPLICATION OF PRIORITY OF SERVICE FOR COVERED PERSONS
#### Subpart B - Understanding Priority of Service
##### § 1010.230 In addition to the responsibilities of all recipients, do States and political subdivisions of States have any particular responsibilities in implementing priority of service?

(a) Pursuant to their responsibility under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, States are required to address priority of service in their comprehensive strategic plan for the State's workforce investment system. Specifically, States must develop policies for the delivery of priority of service by the State Workforce Agency or Agencies, Local Workforce Investment Boards, and One-Stop Career Centers for all qualified job training programs delivered through the State's workforce system. The policy or policies must require that processes are in place to ensure that covered persons are identified at the point of entry and given an opportunity to take full advantage of priority of service. These processes shall be undertaken to ensure that covered persons are aware of:

(1) Their entitlement to priority of service;

(2) The full array of employment, training, and placement services available under priority of service; and

(3) Any applicable eligibility requirements for those programs and/or services.

(b) The State's policy or policies must require Local Workforce Investment Boards to develop and include in their strategic local plan, policies implementing priority of service for the local One-Stop Career Centers and for service delivery by local workforce preparation and training providers. These policies must establish processes to ensure that covered persons are identified at the point of entry so that covered persons are able to take full advantage of priority of service. These processes shall ensure that covered persons are aware of:

(1) Their entitlement to priority of service;

(2) The full array of employment, training, and placement services available under priority of service; and

(3) Any applicable eligibility requirements for those programs and/or services.
