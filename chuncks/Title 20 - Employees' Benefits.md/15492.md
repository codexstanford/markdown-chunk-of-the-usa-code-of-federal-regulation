####### § 702.422 Effect of failure to report on medical care after initial authorization.

(a) Notwithstanding that medical care is properly obtained in accordance with these regulations, a finding by the Director that a medical care provider has failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the Act shall operate as a mandatory revocation of authorization of such medical care provider. The effect of a final finding to this effect operates to release the employer/carrier from liability of the expenses of such care. In addition to this, when such a finding is made by the Director, the claimant receiving treatment will be directed by the district director to seek authorization for medical care from another source.

(b) For good cause shown, the Director may excuse the failure to comply with the reporting requirements of the Act and further, may make an award for the reasonable value of such medical care.
