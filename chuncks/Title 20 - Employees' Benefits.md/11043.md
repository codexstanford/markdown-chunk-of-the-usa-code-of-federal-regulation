### PART 618 - TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE UNDER THE TRADE ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED
#### Subpart D - Job Search and Relocation Allowances
##### § 618.405 General.

(a) A State must grant a job search allowance to an AAW to help the worker secure suitable employment within the United States if the AAW meets the requirements in this subpart. A job search allowance for activities outside of the worker's commuting area may be provided for costs including, but not limited to:

(1) Travel to and attendance at job fairs and interviews;

(2) Travel to and attendance at prevocational workshops;

(3) Making an in-person visit with a potential employer who may reasonably be expected to have openings for suitable employment;

(4) Completing a job application in person with a potential employer who may reasonably be expected to have openings for suitable employment;

(5) Going to a local one-stop, copy shop, Post Office, or similar entity to print, copy, mail, email, or fax a job application, cover letter, and/or a resume;

(6) Going to a local one-stop, public library, community center, or similar entity to use online job matching systems, to search for job matches, request referrals, submit applications/resumes, attend workshops, and/or apply for jobs; and,

(7) Attending a professional association meeting for networking purposes.

(b) A State must grant a relocation allowance to an AAW to help the worker and the worker's family relocate within the United States if the AAW meets the requirements in this subpart. A State may grant a relocation allowance to a worker only once under a certification. A State may grant a relocation allowance to only one member of a family for the same relocation, even if there are multiple AAWs in the same family. If more than one member of a family applies for a relocation allowance for the same relocation, then the State must pay the allowance to the AAW who files first, if that AAW is otherwise eligible.
