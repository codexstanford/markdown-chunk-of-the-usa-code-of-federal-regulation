#### Subpart H - Administrative Adjudication and Judicial Review
##### § 683.840 Is there an alternative dispute resolution process that may be used in place of an Office of Administrative Law Judges hearing?

(a) The parties to a complaint which has been filed according to the requirements of § 683.800 may choose to waive their rights to an administrative hearing before the OALJ. Instead, they may choose to transfer the settlement of their dispute to an individual acceptable to all parties who will conduct an informal review of the stipulated facts and render a decision in accordance with applicable law. A written decision must be issued within 60 days after submission of the matter for informal review.

(b) The waiver of the right to request a hearing before the OALJ described in paragraph (a) of this section will automatically be revoked if a settlement has not been reached or a written decision has not been issued within the 60 days provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The decision rendered under this informal review process will be treated as a final decision of an Administrative Law Judge under WIOA sec. 186(b).
