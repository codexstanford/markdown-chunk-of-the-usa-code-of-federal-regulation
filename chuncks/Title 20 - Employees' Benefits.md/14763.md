##### § 680.620 How does the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program relate to the one-stop delivery system?

The local TANF program is a required partner in the one-stop delivery system. Part 678 of this chapter describes the roles of such partners in the one-stop delivery system and it applies to the TANF program. TANF serves individuals who also may be served by the WIOA programs and, through appropriate linkages and referrals, these customers will have access to a broader range of services through the cooperation of the TANF program in the one-stop delivery system. TANF participants, who are determined to be WIOA eligible, and who need occupational skills training may be referred through the one-stop delivery system to receive WIOA training, when TANF grant and other grant funds are not available to the individual in accordance with § 680.230(a). WIOA participants who also are determined TANF eligible may be referred to the TANF program for assistance.
