(b) Instruction, education, and guidance a State provides local reporting officials-to assess a State's systems for assuring on a continuing basis that all reporting officials and their staffs have the necessary instructions, guidelines, and training to meet the State's coverage, reporting and recordkeeping requirements;

(c) Compliance by reporting officials-to assess a State's systems for assuring that the reporting officials in the State have adequate recordkeeping procedures, are properly applying the appropriate provisions of the State's agreement, and are complying with reporting requirements; and

(d) Quality control with prompt corrective action-to assess a State's systems for assuring that its reports and those of its political subdivisions are correct, for identifying the causes and extent of any deficiencies, and for promptly correcting these deficiencies.
