This information may be collected through methods that include electronic data transfer, personal interview, or an individual's application. Individuals are considered participants when they have received a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) service other than self-service or information-only activities and have satisfied all applicable programmatic requirements for the provision of services, such as eligibility determination (§ 677.150(a) of this chapter).

(b) Adults and dislocated workers who receive services funded under WIOA title I other than self-service or information-only activities must be registered and must be a participant.

(c) EO data, as defined in § 675.300 of this chapter, must be collected on every individual who is interested in being considered for WIOA title I financially assisted aid, benefits, services, or training by a recipient, and who has signified that interest by submitting personal information in response to a request from the grant recipient or designated service provider.
