##### § 668.240 What is the process for applying for designation as an INA grantee?

(a) Every entity seeking designation must submit a Notice of Intent (NOI) which complies with the requirements of the Solicitation for Grant Application (SGA). An SGA will be issued every two years, covering all areas except for those for which competition is waived for the incumbent grantee under WIA section 166(c)(2).

(b) NOI's must be submitted to the Chief of DINAP, bearing a U.S. Postal Service postmark indicating its submission no later than October 1st of the year which precedes the first year of a new designation cycle (unless the SGA provides a later date). For NOI's received after October 1, only a timely official U.S. Postal Service postmark is acceptable as proof of timely submission. Dates indicating submission by private express delivery services or metered mail are unacceptable as proof of the timely submission of designation documents.

(c) NOI's must include the following:

(1) Documentation of the legal status of the entity, as described in § 668.200(a)(1);

(2) A Standard Form (SF) 424b;

(3) The assurances required by 29 CFR 37.20;

(4) A specific description, by State, county, reservation or similar area, or service population, of the geographic area for which the entity requests designation;

(5) A brief summary of the employment and training or human resource development programs serving Native Americans that the entity currently operates or has operated within the previous two-year period;

(6) A description of the planning process used by the entity, including the involvement of the governing body and local employers;

(7) Evidence to establish an entity's ability to administer funds under §§ 668.220 through 668.230.
