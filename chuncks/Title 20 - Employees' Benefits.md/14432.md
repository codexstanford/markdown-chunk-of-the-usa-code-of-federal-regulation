##### § 670.915 When is a Job Corps student considered to be in the performance of duty?

(a) Performance of duty is a determination that must be made by the OWCP under FECA, and is based on the individual circumstances in each claim.

(b) In general, residential students may be considered to be in the "performance of duty" when:

(1) They are on center under the supervision and control of Job Corps officials;

(2) They are engaged in any authorized Job Corps activity;

(3) They are in authorized travel status; or

(4) They are engaged in any authorized offsite activity.

(c) Non-resident students are generally considered to be "in performance of duty" as Federal employees when they are engaged in any authorized Job Corps activity, from the time they arrive at any scheduled center activity until they leave the activity. The standard rules governing coverage of Federal employees during travel to and from work apply. These rules are described in guidance issued by the Secretary.

(d) Students are generally considered to be not in the performance of duty when:

(1) They are Absent Without Leave (AWOL);

(2) They are at home, whether on pass or on leave;

(3) They are engaged in an unauthorized offsite activity; or

(4) They are injured or ill due to their own willful misconduct, intent to cause injury or death to oneself or another or through intoxication or illegal use of drugs.
