(1) Plan for and respond to as quickly as possible following an event described in § 682.302; and

(2) Deliver services to enable dislocated workers to transition to new employment as quickly as possible.

(3) Convening, brokering, and facilitating the connections, networks and partners to ensure the ability to provide assistance to dislocated workers and their families such as home heating assistance, legal aid, and financial advice; and

(4) Strategic planning, data gathering and analysis designed to anticipate, prepare for, and manage economic change.
