###### States with Medicaid eligibility determination agreement.

(a)A State with which we have an agreement to make Medicaid eligibility determinations is charged in the following manner:

(1) If making Medicaid determinations and providing basic SSI application information for a State causes us additional cost, the State must pay half of that additional cost. "Additional cost" in this section means cost in addition to costs we would have had anyway in administering the SSI program.

(2) The State must pay half our additional cost caused by providing any information that we collect for Medicaid purposes and by any other services directly related to making Medicaid eligibility determinations.

(3) The State must pay our full additional cost for statistical or other studies and any other services that are not directly related to making Medicaid eligibility determinations.
