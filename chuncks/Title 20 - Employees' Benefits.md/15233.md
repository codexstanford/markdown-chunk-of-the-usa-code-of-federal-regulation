### PART 687 - NATIONAL DISLOCATED WORKER GRANTS
#### § 687.100 What are the types and purposes of National Dislocated Worker Grants under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act?

There are two types and purposes of National Dislocated Worker Grants (DWGs) under sec. 170 of WIOA: Employment Recovery DWGs and Disaster Recovery DWGs.

(a) Employment Recovery DWGs provide employment and training activities for dislocated workers and other eligible populations. They are intended to expand service capacity temporarily at the State and local levels, by providing time-limited funding assistance in response to major economic dislocations or other events that affect the U.S. workforce that cannot be accommodated with WIOA formula funds or other relevant existing resources.

(b) Disaster Recovery DWGs allow for the creation of disaster relief employment to assist with clean-up and recovery efforts from emergencies or major disasters and the provision of employment and training activities, in accordance with § 687.180(b).
