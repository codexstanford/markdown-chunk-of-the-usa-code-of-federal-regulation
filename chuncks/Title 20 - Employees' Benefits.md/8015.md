###### § 416.927 Evaluating opinion evidence for claims filed before March 27, 2017.
####### Length of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination.

(i)Generally, the longer a treating source has treated you and the more times you have been seen by a treating source, the more weight we will give to the source's medical opinion. When the treating source has seen you a number of times and long enough to have obtained a longitudinal picture of your impairment, we will give the medical source's medical opinion more weight than we would give it if it were from a nontreating source.
