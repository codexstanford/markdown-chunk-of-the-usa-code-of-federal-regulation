##### Determinations and the Administrative Review Process
###### § 418.1340 What are the rules for our administrative review process?

To the extent that they are not inconsistent with the rules in this subpart for making initial determinations and reconsidered determinations, we will use the same rules for the administrative review process that we use for determinations and decisions about your rights regarding non-medical issues under title II of the Act, as described in subpart J of part 404 of this chapter. We will accept oral requests as well as the written requests required in subpart J of part 404 of this chapter for requesting administrative review of our determination. If you are dissatisfied with our reconsidered determination, you may request review in accordance with § 418.1350 for this subpart. A request for a new initial determination, described in § 418.1310, is not the same as a request for reconsideration or further administrative review.
