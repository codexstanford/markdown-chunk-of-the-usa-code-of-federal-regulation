##### Filing of Application
###### § 418.3201 Must you file an application to become eligible for a subsidy?

Unless you are a person covered by § 418.3105, in addition to meeting other requirements, you or your personal representative must file an application to become eligible for a subsidy. If you believe you may be eligible for a subsidy, you should file an application. Filing a subsidy application does not commit you to participate in the Part D program. Filing an application will:

(a) Permit us to make a formal determination on your eligibility for the subsidy and whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy;

(b) Assure that you can receive the subsidy for any months that you are eligible and are enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage; and

(c) Give you the right to appeal if you disagree with our determination.
