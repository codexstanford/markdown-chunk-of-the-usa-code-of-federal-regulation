## Chapter V - Employment and Training Administration, Department of Labor
### PART 684 - INDIAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN PROGRAMS UNDER TITLE I OF THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT
#### Subpart F - Accountability for Services and Expenditures
##### § 684.610 How is this accountability documented and fulfilled?

(a) Each INA program grantee must establish its own internal policies and procedures to ensure accountability to the INA program grantee's governing body, as the representative of the INA community(ies) served by the INA program. At a minimum, these policies and procedures must provide a system for governing body review and oversight of program plans and measures and standards for program performance.

(b) Accountability to the Department is accomplished in part through on-site program reviews (monitoring), which strengthen the INA program grantee's capability to deliver effective services and protect the integrity of Federal funds.

(c) In addition to audit information, as described at § 684.860 and program reviews, accountability to the Department is documented and fulfilled by the submission of quarterly financial and program reports, and compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant award.
