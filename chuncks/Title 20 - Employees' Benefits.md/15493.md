####### § 702.431 Grounds for debarment.

A physician or health care provider shall be debarred if it is found, after appropriate investigation as described in § 702.414 and proceedings under §§ 702.432 and 702.433, that such physician or health care provider has:

(a) Knowingly and willfully made, or caused to be made, any false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact for use in a claim for compensation or claim for reimbursement of medical expenses under this Act;

(b) Knowingly and willfully submitted, or caused to be submitted, a bill or request for payment under this Act containing a charge which the Director finds to be substantially in excess of the charge for the service, appliance, or supply prevailing within the community or in excess of the provider's customary charges, unless the Director finds there is good cause for the bill or request containing the charge;

(c) Knowingly and willfully furnished a service, appliance, or supply which is determined by the Director to be substantially in excess of the need of the recipient thereof or to be of a quality which substantially fails to meet professionally recognized standards;

(d) Been convicted under any criminal statute, without regard to pending appeal thereof, for fraudulent activities in connection with federal or state program for which payments are made to physicians or providers of similar services, appliances, or supplies; or has otherwise been excluded from participation in such program.

(e) The fact that a physician or health care provider has been convicted of a crime previously described in (d), or excluded or suspended, or has resigned in lieu of exclusion or suspension, from participation in any program as described in (d), shall be a prima facie finding of fact for purposes of section 7(j)(2) of the Act, 33 U.S.C. 907(j)(2).
