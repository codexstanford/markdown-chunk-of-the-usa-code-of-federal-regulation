##### Oral Argument Before the Board
###### § 802.307 Notice of oral argument.

(a) In cases where a request for oral argument has been approved or where oral argument has been ordered, the Board shall give all parties a minimum of 30 days' notice, in writing, by mail, of the scope of argument and of the time when, and place where, oral argument will be held.

(b) Once oral argument has been scheduled by the Board, continuances shall not be granted except for good cause shown by a party, such as in cases of extreme hardship or where attendance of a party or his or her representative is mandated at a previously scheduled judicial proceeding. Unless the ground for the request arises thereafter, requests for continuances must be received by the Board at least 15 days before the scheduled date of oral argument, must be served upon the other parties and must specify good cause why the requesting party cannot be available for oral argument.

(c) The Board may cancel or reschedule oral argument on its own motion at any time.
