(a) The payment level for adults must be established by the Local WDB. For statewide projects, the payment level for adults must be established by the State WDB.

(b) For dislocated workers, payments must not exceed the greater of either of the following levels:

(1) The applicable weekly level of the unemployment compensation benefit, for participants who were eligible for unemployment compensation as a result of the qualifying dislocation; or

(2) The poverty level for an equivalent period, for participants who did not qualify for unemployment compensation as a result of the qualifying layoff. The weekly payment level must be adjusted to reflect changes in total family income, as determined by Local WDB policies.
