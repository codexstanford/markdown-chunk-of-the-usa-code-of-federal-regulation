###### § 234.15 When an employee's estate is entitled.

(a) The employee's estate is considered an equitably entitled person if the funds used to pay burial expenses consisted of:

(1) Money in the employee's single-ownership bank account;

(2) Money paid directly to the funeral home by the employee before death;

(3) Money paid by the employee under a contract, plan, system or general practice where no beneficiary was named to receive the money;

(4) Money found among the employee's effects;

(5) Unpaid salary due the employee by the employee's employer;

(6) Money obtained by selling the employee's real or personal property; or

(7) Money from a trust fund.

(b) If the employee's estate is the equitably entitled person, the Board will pay the LSDP to the legal representative of the employee's estate. When no legal representative of the employee's estate has been or is expected to be appointed, the Board will pay the LSDP according to state statutory procedures applicable when no formal probate or administration occurs.
