#### PART 704 - SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR LHWCA EXTENSIONS
##### § 704.002 Scope of part.

The regulations governing the administration of the LHWCA as set forth in parts 702 and 703 of this subchapter govern the administration of the LHWCA extensions (see § 704.001) in nearly every respect, and are not repeated in this part 704.
