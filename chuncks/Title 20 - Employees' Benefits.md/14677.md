##### § 679.260 What do the terms "performed successfully" and "sustained fiscal integrity" mean for purposes of designating local areas?

(a) For the purpose of initial local area designation, the term "performed successfully" means that the local area met or exceeded the levels of performance the Governor negotiated with the Local WDB and chief elected official under WIA sec. 136(c) for the last 2 full program years before the enactment of WIOA, and that the local area has not failed any individual measure for the last 2 consecutive program years before the enactment of WIOA.

(b) For the purpose of determining subsequent local area designation, the term "performed successfully" means that the local area met or exceeded the levels of performance the Governor negotiated with the Local WDB and chief elected official for core indicators of performance as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section as appropriate, and that the local area has not failed any individual measure for the last 2 consecutive program years in accordance with a State-established definition, provided in the State Plan, of met or exceeded performance.

(1) For subsequent designation determinations made at the conclusion of PY 2017, a finding of whether a local area performed successfully must be limited to having met or exceeded the negotiated levels for the Employment Rate 2nd Quarter after Exit and the Median Earnings indicators of performance, as described at § 677.155(a)(1)(i) and (iii) of this chapter respectively, for PY 2016 and PY 2017.

(2) For subsequent designation determinations made at the conclusion of PY 2018, or at any point thereafter, a finding of whether a local area performed successfully must be based on all six of the WIOA indicators of performance as described at § 677.155(a)(1)(i) through (vi) of this chapter for the 2 most recently completed program years.

(c) For the purpose of determining initial and subsequent local area designation under § 679.250(a) and (b), the term "sustained fiscal integrity" means that the Secretary has not made a formal determination that either the grant recipient or the administrative entity of the area misexpended funds due to willful disregard of the requirements of the provision involved, gross negligence, or failure to comply with accepted standards of administration for the 2-year period preceding the determination.
