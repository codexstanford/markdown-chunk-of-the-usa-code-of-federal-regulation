####### § 10.118 Does the employer participate in the claims process in any other way?

(a) The employer is responsible for submitting to OWCP all relevant and probative factual and medical evidence in its possession, or which it may acquire through investigation or other means. Such evidence may be submitted at any time.

(b) The employer may ascertain the events surrounding an injury and the extent of disability where it appears that an employee who alleges total disability may be performing other work, or may be engaging in activities which would indicate less than total disability. This authority is in addition to that given in § 10.118(a). However, the provisions of the Privacy Act apply to any endeavor by the employer to ascertain the facts of the case (see §§ 10.10 and 10.11).

(c) The employer does not have the right, except as provided in subpart C of this part, to actively participate in the claims adjudication process.
