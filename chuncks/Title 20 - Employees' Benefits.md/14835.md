Parents, youth participants, and other members of the community can get involved in a number of ways, including serving on youth standing committees, if they exist and they are appointed by the Local WDB. They also can get involved by serving as mentors, serving as tutors, and providing input into the design and implementation of other program design elements. Local WDBs also must make opportunities available to successful participants to volunteer to help participants as mentors, tutors, or in other activities.
