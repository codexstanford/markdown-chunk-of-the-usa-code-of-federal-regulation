###### § 404.1321 Ninety-day active service requirement for post-World War II veterans.

(a) The 90 days of active service required for post-World War II veterans do not have to be consecutive if the 90 days were in the post-World War II period. The 90-day requirement cannot be met by totaling the periods of active duty for training purposes before 1957 which were less than 90 days.

(b) If, however, all of the 90 days of active service required for post-World War II veterans were not in the post-World War II period, the 90 days must (only in those circumstances) be consecutive if the 90 days began before July 25, 1947, and ended on or after that date, or began before January 1, 1957, and ended on or after that date.

(c) The 90 days of active service is not required if the post-World War II veteran died in service or was separated from service under conditions other than dishonorable because of a disability or injury which began or worsened while performing service duties.
