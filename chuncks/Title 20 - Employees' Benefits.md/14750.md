(b) The Governor may designate a State agency (or appropriate State entity) to assist in carrying out the process and procedures for determining the eligibility of training providers and programs of training services. The Governor or such agency (or appropriate State entity) is responsible for:

(1) Ensuring the development and maintenance of the State list of eligible training providers and programs, as described in §§ 680.450 (initial eligibility), 680.460 (continued eligibility), and 680.490 (performance and cost information reporting requirements);

(2) Ensuring that programs meet eligibility criteria and performance levels established by the State, including verifying the accuracy of the information;

(3) Removing programs that do not meet State-established program criteria or performance levels, as described in § 680.480(c);

(4) Taking appropriate enforcement actions against providers that intentionally provide inaccurate information, or that substantially violate the requirements of WIOA, as described in § 680.480(a) and (b); and

(5) Disseminating the State list of eligible training providers and programs, accompanied by performance and cost information relating to each program, to the public and the Local WDBs throughout the State, as further described in § 680.500.

(c) The Local WDB must:

(1) Carry out the procedures assigned to the Local WDB by the State, such as determining the initial eligibility of entities providing a program of training services, renewing the eligibility of providers and programs, and considering the possible termination of an eligible training provider due to the provider's submission of inaccurate eligibility and performance information or the provider's substantial violation of WIOA requirements;

(2) Work with the State to ensure there are sufficient numbers and types of providers of training services, including eligible providers with expertise in assisting individuals with disabilities and eligible providers with expertise in assisting adults in need of adult education and literacy activities described under WIOA sec. 107(d)(10)(E), serving the local area; and

(3) Ensure the dissemination and appropriate use of the State list of eligible training providers and programs through the local one-stop delivery system, including formats accessible to individuals with disabilities.

(d) The Local WDB may make recommendations to the Governor on the procedure used in determining eligibility of providers and programs.

(e) The Local WDB may, except with respect to registered apprenticeship programs:

(1) Require additional criteria and information from local providers as criteria to become or remain eligible in that local area; and

(2) Set higher levels of performance than those required by the State as criteria for local programs to become or remain eligible to provide services in that local area.
