## Chapter II - Railroad Retirement Board
### Subchapter C - Regulations Under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act
#### PART 341 - STATUTORY LIEN WHERE SICKNESS BENEFITS PAID
##### § 341.5 Amount of reimbursement.

(a) The Board shall receive as reimbursement the lesser of:

(1) The amount of sickness benefits paid to the employee for the infirmity for which he or she recovers any sum or damages; or

(2) The net amount of the sum or damages paid to the employee for the infirmity, after substracting the amount of the expenses listed in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) The expenses that may be subtracted from the amount of damages recovered are:

(1) The medical and hospital expenses that the employee incurred because of his or her injury. These expenses are deductible even if they are paid under an insurance policy covering the employee or are covered by his or her membership in a medical or hospital plan or association. But such expenses are not deductible if they are not covered by insurance or by membership in a medical or hospital plan or association and are consequently paid by a railroad or other person directly to the doctor, clinic or hospital that provided the medical care or services.

(2) The cost of litigation. This includes both the amount of the fee to which the attorney and the employee have agreed and the other expenses that the employee incurred in the conduct of the litigation itself.
