If you or your personal representative (as defined in 42 CFR 423.772) make an oral or written inquiry about the subsidy, or partially complete an Internet subsidy application on our Web site, we will use the date of the inquiry or the date the partial Internet application was started as your filing date if the following requirements are met:

(a) The written or oral inquiry indicates your intent to file for the subsidy, or you submit a partially completed Internet application to us;

(b) The inquiry, whether in person, by telephone, or in writing, is directed to an office or an official described in § 418.3220, or a partially completed Internet subsidy application is received by us;

(c) You or your personal representative (as defined in 42 CFR 423.772) file an application (as defined in § 418.3210) within 60 days after the date of the notice we will send in response to the inquiry. The notice will say that we will make an initial determination of your eligibility for a subsidy, if an application is filed within 60 days after the date of the notice. We will send the notice to you. Where you are a minor or adjudged legally incompetent and your personal representative made the inquiry, we will send the notice to your personal representative; and

(d) You are alive on the first day of the month in which the application is filed.
