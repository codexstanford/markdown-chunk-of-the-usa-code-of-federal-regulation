##### § 669.540 Under what circumstances are the terms of the grantee's plan modified by the grantee or the Department?

(a) Plans must be modified to reflect the funding level for the second year of the designation cycle. We will provide instructions for when to submit modifications for second year funding, which will generally be no later than June 1 prior to the beginning of the second year of the designation cycle.

(b) We may unilaterally modify the grantee's plan to add funds or, if the total amount of funds available for allotment is reduced by Congress, to reduce each grantee's grant amount.

(c) The grantee may modify its plan to add, delete, expand, or reduce any part of the program plan or allowable activities. Such modifications may be made by the grantee without our approval except where the modification reduces the total number of participants to be served annually under intensive and/or training services by 15 percent or more, in which case the plan may only be modified with Grant Officer approval.

(d) If the grantee is approved for a regulatory waiver under §§ 669.560 and 669.570, the grantee must submit a modification of its service delivery plan to reflect the effect of the waiver.
