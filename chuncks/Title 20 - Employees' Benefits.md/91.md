###### Eligibility for COP
####### § 10.205 What conditions must be met to receive COP?

(a) To be eligible for COP, a person must:

(1) Have a "traumatic injury" as defined at § 10.5(ee) which is job-related and the cause of the disability, and/or the cause of lost time due to the need for medical examination and treatment;

(2) File Form CA-1 within 30 days of the date of the injury (but if that form is not available, using another form would not alone preclude receipt); and

(3) Begin losing time from work due to the traumatic injury within 45 days of the injury.

(b) OWCP may find that the employee is not entitled to COP for other reasons consistent with the statute (see § 10.220).
