####### § 702.201 Reports from employers of employee's injury or death.

(a) Within 10 days from the date of an employee's injury or death, or 10 days from the date an employer has knowledge of an employee's injury or death, including any disease or death proximately caused by the employment, the employer shall furnish a report thereof to the district director for the compensation district in which the injury or death occurred, and shall thereafter furnish such additional or supplemental reports as the district director may request.

(b) No report shall be filed unless the injury causes the employee to lose one or more shifts from work. However, the employer shall keep a record containing the information specified in § 702.202. Compliance with the current OSHA injury record keeping requirements at 29 CFR part 1904 will satisfy the record keeping requirements of this section for no lost time injuries.
