#### Subpart C - Funding and Selection of Center Operators and Service Providers
##### § 686.330 What is the length of an agreement entered into by the Secretary for operation of a Job Corps center and what are the conditions for renewal of such an agreement?

(a) Agreements are for not more than a 2-year period. The Secretary may exercise any contractual option to renew the agreement in 1-year increments for not more than 3 additional years.

(b) The Secretary will establish procedures for evaluating the option to renew an agreement that includes: An assessment of the factors described in paragraph (c) of this section; a review of contract performance and financial reporting compliance; a review of the program management and performance data described in §§ 686.1000 and 686.1010; an assessment of whether the center is on a performance improvement plan as described § 686.1070 and if so, whether the center is making measureable progress in completing the actions described in the plan; and an evaluation of the factors described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(c) The Secretary only will renew the agreement of an entity to operate a Job Corps center if the entity:

(1) Has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics;

(2) Has adequate financial resources to perform the agreement;

(3) Has the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and technical skills; and

(4) Is otherwise qualified and eligible under applicable laws and regulations, including that the contractor is not under suspension or debarred from eligibility for Federal contractors.

(d) The Secretary will not renew an agreement for an entity to operate a Job Corps center for any additional 1-year period if, for both of the 2 most recent preceding program years for which information is available at the time the determination is made, or if a second program year is not available, the preceding year for which information is available, such center:

(1) Has been ranked in the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps centers according to the rankings calculated under § 686.1060; and

(2) Failed to achieve an average of 50 percent or higher of the expected level of performance established under § 686.1050 with respect to each of the primary indicators of performance for eligible youth described in sec. 116(b)(2)(A)(ii) of WIOA, listed in § 686.1010.

(e)(1) Information will be considered to be available for a program year for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section if for each of the primary indicators of performance, all of the students included in the cohort being measured either began their participation under the current center operator or, if they began their participation under the previous center operator, were on center for at least 6 months under the current operator. If an operator assumes operation of a center that meets the criteria under paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the first contractual option year will not be denied based on the application of paragraph (d) of this section provided that the operator otherwise meets the requirements for renewal described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

(2) If complete information for any of the indicators of performance described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is not available for either of the 2 program years described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary will review partial program year data from the most recent program year for those indicators, if at least two quarters of data are available, when making the determination required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(f) If any of the program years described in paragraph (d) of this section precede the implementation of the establishment of the expected levels of performance under § 686.1050 and the application of the primary indicators of performance for Job Corps centers described in § 686.1010, the evaluation described in paragraph (d) of this section will be based on whether in its operation of the center the entity:

(1) Is ranked among the lowest 10 percent of Job Corps centers for the most recent preceding program year according to the ranking calculated under § 686.1060; and

(2) Meets the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) of this section with respect to such preceding program years using the performance of the Job Corps center regarding the national goals or targets established by the Office of the Job Corps under the previous performance accountability system for-

(i) The 6-month follow-up placement rate of graduates in employment, the military, education, or training;

(ii) The 12-month follow-up placement rate of graduates in employment, the military, education, or training;

(iii) The 6-month follow-up average weekly earnings of graduates;

(iv) The rate of attainment of secondary school diplomas or their recognized equivalent;

(v) The rate of attainment of completion certificates for career technical training;

(vi) Average literacy gains; and

(vii) Average numeracy gains.

(g) The Secretary can exercise an option to renew the agreement with an entity notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section for no more than 2 additional years if the Secretary determines that a renewal would be in the best interest of the Job Corps program, taking into account factors including:

(1) Significant improvements in program performance in carrying out a performance improvement plan;

(2) That the performance is due to circumstances beyond the control of the entity, such as an emergency or disaster;

(3) A significant disruption in the operations of the center, including in the ability to continue to provide services to students, or significant increase in the cost of such operations; or

(4) A significant disruption in the procurement process with respect to carrying out a competition for the selection of a center operator.

(h) If the Secretary does make an exception and exercises the option to renew per paragraph (g) of this section, the Secretary will provide a detailed explanation of the rationale for exercising the option to the Committee on Education and the Workforce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate.
