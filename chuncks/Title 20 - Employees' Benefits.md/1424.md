(2) The disability annuity of an employee, child, or widow(er) who is disabled for any regular employment will not be paid for-

(i) Any month, after the 3rd month, in this period in which the annuitant does substantial gainful activity; or

(ii) Any month in this period in which the annuitant works for an employer covered by the Railroad Retirement Act (see § 220.160).
