##### § 667.170 What responsibility review does the Department conduct for awards made under WIA title I, subtitle D?

(a) Before final selection as a potential grantee, we conduct a review of the available records to assess the organization's overall responsibility to administer Federal funds. As part of this review, we may consider any information that has come to our attention and will consider the organization's history with regard to the management of other grants, including DOL grants. The failure to meet any one responsibility test, except for those listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, does not establish that the organization is not responsible unless the failure is substantial or persistent (for two or more consecutive years). The responsibility tests include:

(1) The organization's efforts to recover debts (for which three demand letters have been sent) established by final agency action have been unsuccessful, or that there has been failure to comply with an approved repayment plan;

(2) Established fraud or criminal activity of a significant nature within the organization.

(3) Serious administrative deficiencies that we identify, such as failure to maintain a financial management system as required by Federal regulations;

(4) Willful obstruction of the audit process;

(5) Failure to provide services to applicants as agreed to in a current or recent grant or to meet applicable performance standards;

(6) Failure to correct deficiencies brought to the grantee's attention in writing as a result of monitoring activities, reviews, assessments, or other activities;

(7) Failure to return a grant closeout package or outstanding advances within 90 days of the grant expiration date or receipt of closeout package, whichever is later, unless an extension has been requested and granted; final billings reflecting serious cost category or total budget cost overrun;

(8) Failure to submit required reports;

(9) Failure to properly report and dispose of government property as instructed by DOL;

(10) Failure to have maintained effective cash management or cost controls resulting in excess cash on hand;

(11) Failure to ensure that a subrecipient complies with its OMB Circular A-133 audit requirements specified at § 667.200(b);

(12) Failure to audit a subrecipient within the required period;

(13) Final disallowed costs in excess of five percent of the grant or contract award if, in the judgement of the grant officer, the disallowances are egregious findings and;

(14) Failure to establish a mechanism to resolve a subrecipient's audit in a timely fashion.

(b) This responsibility review is independent of the competitive process. Applicants which are determined to be not responsible will not be selected as potential grantees irrespective of their standing in the competition.
