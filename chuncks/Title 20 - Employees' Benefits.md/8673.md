##### § 416.1226 What is a plan to achieve self-support (PASS)?

(a) A PASS must-

(1) Be designed especially for you;

(2) Be in writing;

(3) Be approved by us (a change of plan must also be approved by us);

(4) Have a specific employment goal that is feasible for you, that is, a goal that you have a reasonable likelihood of achieving;

(5) Have a plan to reach your employment goal that is viable and financially sustainable, that is, the plan-

(i) Sets forth steps that are attainable in order to reach your goal, and

(ii) Shows that you will have enough money to meet your living expenses while setting aside income or resources to reach your goal;

(6) Be limited to one employment goal; however, the employment goal may be modified and any changes related to the modification must be made to the plan;

(7) Show how the employment goal will generate sufficient earnings to substantially reduce your dependence on SSI or eliminate your need for title II disability benefits;

(8) Contain a beginning date and an ending date to meet your employment goal;

(9) Give target dates for meeting milestones towards your employment goal;

(10) Show what expenses you will have and how they are reasonable and necessary to meet your employment goal;

(11) Show what resources you have and will receive, how you will use them to attain your employment goal, and how you will meet your living expenses; and

(12) Show how the resources you set aside under the plan will be kept separate from your other resources.

(b) You must propose a reasonable ending date for your PASS. If necessary, we can help you establish an ending date, which may be different than the ending date you propose. Once the ending date is set and you begin your PASS, we may adjust or extend the ending date of your PASS based on progress towards your goal and earnings level reached.

(c) If your employment goal is self-employment, you must include a business plan that defines the business, provides a marketing strategy, details financial data, outlines the operational procedures, and describes the management plan.

(d) Your progress will be reviewed at least annually to determine if you are following the provisions of your plan.
