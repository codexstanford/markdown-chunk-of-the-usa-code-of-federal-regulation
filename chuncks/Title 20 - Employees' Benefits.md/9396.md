###### § 418.1235 When will we stop using your more recent tax year's modified adjusted gross income to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount?

We will use your more recent tax year's modified adjusted gross income to determine your income-related monthly adjustment amount effective with the month and year described in § 418.1230 and for each year thereafter until one of the following occurs:

(a) We receive your modified adjusted gross income from IRS for the more recent tax year we used or a later tax year;

(b) Your more recent tax year modified adjusted gross income that we used is for a tax year more than 3 years prior to the income-related monthly adjustment amount effective year;

(c) You request we use a more recent tax year based on another major life-changing event as described in § 418.1201; or

(d) You notify us of a change in your modified adjusted gross income for the more recent tax year we used as described in § 418.1240.
