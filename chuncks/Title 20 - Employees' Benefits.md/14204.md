##### § 667.730 What is the procedure to handle a recipient's request for advance approval of contemplated corrective actions?

(a) The recipient may request advance approval from the Grant Officer for contemplated corrective actions, including debt collection actions, which the recipient plans to initiate or to forego. The recipient's request must include a description and an assessment of all actions taken by the subrecipients to collect the misspent funds.

(b) Based on the recipient's request, the Grant Officer may determine that the recipient may forego certain collection actions against a subrecipient when:

(1) The subrecipient meets the criteria set forth in section 184(d)(2) of the Act;

(2) The misexpenditure of funds:

(i) Was not made by that subrecipient but by an entity that received WIA funds from that subrecipient;

(ii) Was not a violation of section 184(d)(1) of the Act, and did not constitute fraud; or

(iii) If fraud did exist,

(A) It was perpetrated against the subrecipient; and:

(B) The subrecipient discovered, investigated, reported, and cooperated in any prosecution of the perpetrator of the fraud; and

(C) After aggressive debt collection action, it has been documented that further attempts at debt collection from the perpetrator of the fraud would be inappropriate or futile;

(3) A final determination which disallows the misexpenditure and establishes a debt has been issued at the appropriate level;

(4) Final action within the recipient's appeal system has been completed; and

(5) Further debt collection action by that subrecipient or the recipient would be either inappropriate or futile.
