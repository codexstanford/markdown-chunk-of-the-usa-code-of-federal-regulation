##### Review of Compliance by State With Its Agreement
###### § 404.1230 Onsite review program.

To ensure that the services of employees covered by a State's agreement are reported and that those employees receive Social Security credit for their covered earnings, we periodically review the source records upon which a State's contribution returns and wage reports are based. These reviews are designed:

(a) To measure the effectiveness of the State's systems for ensuring that all wages for those employees covered by its agreement are reported and Social Security contributions on those wages are paid;

(b) To detect any misunderstanding of coverage or reporting errors and to advise the State of the corrective action it must take; and

(c) To find ways to improve a State's recordkeeping and reporting operations for the mutual benefit of the State and SSA.
