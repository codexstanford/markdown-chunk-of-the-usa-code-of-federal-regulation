##### Payment Provisions
###### § 416.2212 Payment for VR services in a case where an individual continues to receive disability or blindness benefits based on participation in an approved VR program.

Section 1631(a)(6) of the Act contains the criteria we will use in determining if an individual whose disability or blindness has ceased should continue to receive disability or blindness benefits because of his or her continued participation in an approved VR program. A VR agency can be paid for the cost of VR services provided to an individual if the individual was receiving benefits based on this provision in a month(s) after October 1984 or, in the case of a blindness recipient, in a month(s) after March 1988. If this requirement is met, a VR agency can be paid for the costs of VR services provided within the period specified in § 416.2215, subject to the other payment and administrative provisions of this subpart.
