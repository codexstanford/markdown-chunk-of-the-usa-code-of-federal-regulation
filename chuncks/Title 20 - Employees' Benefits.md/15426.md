####### § 702.231 Noncontroverted claims; payment of compensation without an award.

Unless the employer controverts its liability to pay compensation under this Act, the employer or insurance carrier shall pay periodically, promptly and directly to the person entitled thereto benefits prescribed by the Act. For this purpose, where the employer furnishes to an employee a copy of an audiogram with a report thereon, which indicates the employee has sustained a hearing loss causally related to factors of that employment, the employer or insurance carrier shall pay appropriate compensation or at that time controvert the liability to pay compensation under this Act.
