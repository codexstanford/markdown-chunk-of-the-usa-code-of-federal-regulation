(b) Except to the extent the proprietor is not required to provide a bond under § 19.151(d), TTB will not approve the application submitted under paragraph (a) of this section unless the proprietor's operations bond or unit bond either is in the maximum penal sum amount or is sufficient to cover the tax on the spirits or denatured spirits to be transferred in addition to all other liabilities chargeable against the bond. If TTB approves the application, TTB will return two signed copies of the approved application to the proprietor.
