###### § 28.268 Receipt for liquors for use on vessels or aircraft.

Where liquors are withdrawn or removed for use on vessels or aircraft, the exporter shall procure and forward to the appropriate TTB officer, a receipt executed under the penalties of perjury by the master or other authorized officer of the vessel, steamship company, or airline, as the case may be. The receipt shall give the number of containers, the serial numbers of the containers (if any), and the quantity received, and shall show that the liquors are in customs custody and have been or will be laden on board the vessel or aircraft, that they will be lawfully used on board the vessel or aircraft, and that no portion of the shipment has been or will be unladen in the United States or any of its territories or possessions. A receipt is not required, in the case of any shipment for use on vessels, when the liquors are laden on vessels of war, or, in cases other than supplies for vessels employed in the fisheries, where the amount of the tax on the liquors does not exceed $200. In the case of supplies for vessels employed in the fisheries, compliance with the provisions of § 28.22 is also required.
