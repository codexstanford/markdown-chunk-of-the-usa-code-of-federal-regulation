###### § 28.267 Exportation from interior port.

Where a shipment made under this part is to be exported to a contiguous foreign country through a frontier port, and it is desired to avoid the delay of customs inspection at such port, the shipment may, subject to approval of the district director of customs, be entered for exportation at an interior customs port. Subject to such approval, the inspection and supervision of lading, and the affixing of customs seals, shall be done by a customs officer in accordance with the provisions of U.S. Customs regulations (19 CFR chapter I). On completion of the lading, the seals shall be affixed and the customs officer shall execute the certificate of lading on both copies of the application, notice, or claim, TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6) or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, and forward them, with attachments (if any), to the district director of customs at the interior port of entry. The district director of customs shall forward both copies of the form, with attachments (if any), to the customs officer at the frontier port. When the customs officer at the frontier port is satisfied that the shipment as described on the appropriate form has been exported, he shall execute his certificate on both copies of the form and return them with attachments (if any), to the district director of customs at the interior port of entry.
