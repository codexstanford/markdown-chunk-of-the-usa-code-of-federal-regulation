####### Limited Permittee Transaction Report for distribution of explosive materials on and after May 24, 2003.

(b)(1) A licensee or permittee may not distribute explosive materials to any person who is not a licensee or permittee. A licensee or permittee may not distribute explosive materials to a limited permittee unless the distributor records the transaction on ATF Form 5400.4, Limited Permittee Transaction Report.

(2) Before distributing explosive materials to a limited permittee, the licensee or permittee must obtain an executed Form 5400.4 from the limited permittee with an original unaltered and unexpired Intrastate Purchase of Explosives Coupon (IPEC) affixed. Except when delivery of explosive materials is made by a common or contract carrier who is an agent of the limited permittee, the licensee, permittee, or an agent of the licensee or permittee, must verify the identity of the holder of the limited permit by examining an identification document (as defined in § 555.11) and noting on the Form 5400.4 the type of document presented. The licensee or permittee must complete the appropriate section on Form 5400.4 to indicate the type and quantity of explosive materials distributed, the license or permit number of the seller, and the date of the transaction. The licensee or permittee must sign and date the form and include any other information required by the instructions on the form and the regulations in this part.

(3) One copy of Form 5400.4 must be retained by the distributor as part of his permanent records in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section and for the period specified in § 555.121. The distributor must mail the other copy of Form 5400.4 to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in accordance with the instructions on the form.

(4) Each Form 5400.4 must be retained in chronological order by date of disposition, or in alphabetical order by name of limited permittee. A licensee may not, however, use both methods in a single recordkeeping system. Where there is a change in proprietorship by a limited permittee, the forms may continue to be filed together after such change.

(5) The requirements of this section are in addition to any other recordkeeping requirement contained in this part.
