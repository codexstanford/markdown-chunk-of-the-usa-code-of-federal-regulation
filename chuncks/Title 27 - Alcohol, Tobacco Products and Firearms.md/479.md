###### § 5.89 Multiple distillation claims.

(a) Truthful statements about the number of distillations, such as "double distilled," "distilled three times," or similar terms to convey multiple distillations, may be used if they are truthful statements of fact. For the purposes of this section only, the term "distillation" means a single run through a pot still or a single run through a column of a column (reflux) still. For example, if a column still has three separate columns, one complete additional run through the system would constitute three additional distillations.

(b) The number of distillations may be understated but may not be overstated.
