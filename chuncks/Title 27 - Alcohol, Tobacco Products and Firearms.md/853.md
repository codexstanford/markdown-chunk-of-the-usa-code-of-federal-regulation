###### § 7.142 Class designations.

The following class designations may be used in accordance with this section:

(a) Any malt beverage, as defined in § 7.1, may be designated simply as a "malt beverage."

(b)(1) The class designations "beer," "ale," "porter," "stout," "lager," and "malt liquor" may be used to designate malt beverages that contain at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume and that conform to the trade understanding of those designations. These designations may be preceded or followed by descriptions of the color of the product (such as "amber," "brown," "red," or "golden") as well as descriptive terms such as "dry," "export," "cream," and "pale."

(2) No product other than a malt beverage fermented at a comparatively high temperature, possessing the characteristics generally attributed to "ale," "porter," or "stout" and produced without the use of coloring or flavoring materials (other than those recognized in standard brewing practices) may bear any of these class designations.
