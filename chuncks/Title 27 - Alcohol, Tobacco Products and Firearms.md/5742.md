## Chapter I - Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, Department of the Treasury
### Subchapter A - Alcohol
#### PART 31 - ALCOHOL BEVERAGE DEALERS
##### Subpart E - Places Subject to Registration
###### § 31.74 Places of storage; deliveries therefrom.

Registration is not required under this part for warehouses and similar places that are used by dealers merely for the storage of liquors and that are not places where orders for liquors are accepted. When orders for liquors are received and duly accepted at a place that the dealer has registered under this part, the subsequent actual delivery of the liquors from a place of storage does not require registration at that place of storage. Except as otherwise provided in §§ 31.52 and 31.53, a dealer who registered a given place, and who makes actual delivery of liquors from a warehouse at another place, must register for the place where ownership of the liquors is transferred if there was no prior constructive delivery by the acceptance of an order for the liquors at the place covered by the existing registration.
