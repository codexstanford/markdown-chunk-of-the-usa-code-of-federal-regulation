###### § 28.264 Lading for exportation.

On receipt of the notifcation required in § 28.261, the district director of customs shall deliver both copies of the application, claim, or notice, TTB Form 5100.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, covering the shipment, together with any forms which may be attached thereto, to a customs officer for inspection and supervision of lading. Such shipment shall be subject to the same requirements for inspection and supervision of lading at the port of exportation as may be required by Customs Regulations (19 CFR chapter I) in the case of similar shipments of imported merchandise to be exported in customs bond. When an inspection of the shipment is made before it is laden on board the exporting carrier and such inspection discloses any discrepancy, the customs officer shall make note of the nature and extent of the discrepancy on each copy of the application, claim, or notice, TTB Form 5110.11, 5110.30, 1582-A (5120.24), 1582-B (5130.6), or 1689 (5130.12), as the case may be, and where the discrepancy involves one or more packages of distilled spirits or wine, he shall prepare customs Form 6001 in accordance with the instructions in § 28.291, and attach the original and copy of customs Form 6001 to the original and copy of the appropriate transaction form. The forms shall be disposed of according to the instructions thereon.
