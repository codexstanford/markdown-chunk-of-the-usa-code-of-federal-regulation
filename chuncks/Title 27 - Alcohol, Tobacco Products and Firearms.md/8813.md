A licensed importer who proposes to use alternate records shall submit a letter application to the Chief, Explosives Industry Programs Branch and shall describe the proposed alternate records and the need for them. Alternate records are not to be employed by the licensed importer until approval is received from the Chief, Explosives Industry Programs Branch.
