The certificate shall be executed under the penalties of perjury by an officer of the airline and shall show the name of the exporter, the entry number, the brand and kind of distilled spirits or wines, and the number of bottles to be accounted for; and, as to each requisition, the requisition (or kit) number, the date laden, the registry number of the aircraft, the country for which the aircraft was cleared, and the number of bottles used.
