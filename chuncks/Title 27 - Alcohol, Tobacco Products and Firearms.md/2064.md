###### Approval of Formulas
####### § 17.136 Compliance with Food and Drug Administration requirements.

A product is not a medicine, medicinal preparation, food product, flavor, flavoring extract, or perfume for nonbeverage drawback if its formula would violate a ban or restriction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pertaining to such products. If FDA bans or restricts the use of any ingredient in such a way that further manufacture of a product in accordance with its formula would violate the ban or restriction, then the manufacturer shall change the formula and resubmit it on TTB Form 5154.1 . This section does not preclude approval for products manufactured solely for export or for uses other than internal human consumption (e.g. tobacco flavors or animal feed flavors) in accordance with laws and regulations administered by FDA. Under § 17.123, manufacturers may be required to demonstrate compliance with FDA requirements applicable to this section.
