###### § 24.166 Buildings or rooms.

All buildings or rooms on wine premises in which wine operations or other operations as are authorized in this part are conducted will be located, constructed, and equipped in a manner suitable for the intended purpose and to afford adequate protection to the revenue. Each building or room will be constructed of substantial materials and separated from adjacent or contiguous buildings, rooms, or designated areas in a manner satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer. Where spirits are to be received and stored in packages, a storage room equipped for locking will be provided. The proprietor shall make provisions to assure TTB officers have ready ingress to and egress from any building or room on wine premises, and shall furnish at the request of the appropriate TTB officer evidence that the means of ingress and egress by TTB officers are assured. Where the appropriate TTB officer finds that any building or room on wine premises is located, constructed, or equipped as to afford inadequate protection to the revenue, the proprietor will be required to make changes in location, construction, or equipment to the extent necessary to afford adequate protection to the revenue.
