###### § 555.58 Continuing partnerships.

Where, under the laws of the particular State, the partnership is not terminated on death or insolvency of a partner, but continues until the winding up of the partnership affairs is completed, and the surviving partner has the exclusive right to the control and possession of the partnership assets for the purpose of liquidation and settlement, the surviving partner may continue to conduct the business or operations under the license or permit of the partnership. If the surviving partner acquires the business or operations on completion of settlement of the partnership, he shall obtain a license or permit in his own name from the date of acquisition, as provided in § 555.45. The rule set forth in this section will also apply where there is more than one surviving partner.
