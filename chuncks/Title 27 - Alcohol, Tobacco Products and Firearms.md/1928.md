####### Time limits for decision.

(b)Within 90 days of receipt of written arguments or evidence from the certificate holder, the appropriate TTB officer shall notify the appellant of his or her decision. If a certificate holder requests an informal conference as part of an appeal, as authorized in § 13.71, the 90-day period will begin 10 days after the date of the conference to allow for consideration of any written arguments, facts or evidence submitted after the conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend this period of time once by an additional 90 days if he or she finds that unusual circumstances require additional time to consider the issues presented by a proposed revocation. If the appropriate TTB officer extends the time period, he or she must notify the applicant by letter, along with a brief explanation of the issues under consideration.
