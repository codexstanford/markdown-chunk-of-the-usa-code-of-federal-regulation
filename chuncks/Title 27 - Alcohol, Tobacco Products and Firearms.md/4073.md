###### Dealer Registration and Recordkeeping
####### § 24.52 Dealer registration.

Every proprietor who sells or offers for sale any alcohol product (distilled spirits, wines, or beer) fit for beverage use must register as a dealer in accordance with part 31 of this chapter. However, the proprietor's application to establish and operate a bonded wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house filed under subpart D of this part, and approval of that application by the appropriate TTB officer, will constitute the proprietor's registration as a dealer at the approved bonded or taxpaid wine premises. Every proprietor registered as a dealer under this section will be classified as a wholesale dealer in liquors (see § 31.32 of this chapter) and as such may also operate as a retail dealer in liquors without additional registration. Registration covers all sales from the same location, including sales of spirits, beer, or other proprietors' wine. As provided in § 31.52 of this chapter, the proprietor is subject to no additional registration for making sales of wine or beer at the customer's place of business. Otherwise, a proprietor who conducts business as a dealer at a location other than the bonded wine premises or taxpaid wine bottling house must register and keep records in accordance with part 31 of this chapter.
