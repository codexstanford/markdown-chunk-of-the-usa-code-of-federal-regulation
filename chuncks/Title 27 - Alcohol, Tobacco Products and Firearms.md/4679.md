###### Determination of Tax
####### § 25.160 Tax adjustment for brewers who produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer.

Each brewer who has paid tax on beer by return, Form 5000.24, at the reduced rate of tax during a calendar year, but whose production (or the production of a controlled group of brewers of which the brewer is a member) exceeds 2,000.000 barrels of beer in that calendar year, is no longer eligible to pay tax on beer at the reduced rate of tax for any beer removed that calendar year for consumption or sale. The brewer shall make a tax adjustment for the payment of additional tax no later than the return period in which production (or the production of a controlled group of brewers of which the brewer is a member) exceeds 2,000,000 barrels of beer. The adjustment will be determined by multiplying the difference between the higher and lower rates of tax applicable to beer by the number of barrels removed by the brewer that year at the reduced rate of tax. The brewer shall make tax adjustments for all breweries where tax was paid at the lower rate that year, and shall include interest payable from the date on which tax was paid at the lower rate. In the case of a controlled group of brewers whose production exceeds 2,000,000 barrels of beer, all member brewers who paid tax at the lower rate shall make tax adjustments as determined in this section.
