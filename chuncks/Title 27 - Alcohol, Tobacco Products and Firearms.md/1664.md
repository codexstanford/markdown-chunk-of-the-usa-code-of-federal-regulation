(4) Proceed north-northwesterly (downstream) along the meandering Indian Creek approximately 8.5 miles in straight-line distance, crossing onto the Shedd Canyon map, to the creek's intersection with the northern boundary line of section 13, T27S/R14E, within Shedd Canyon; then

(5) Proceed east approximately 6.2 miles along the northern boundary line of section 13, T27S/R14E, and the northern boundary lines of sections 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13, T27S/R15E, crossing onto the Camatta Canyon map, to the intersection of the northern boundary line of section 13, T27S/R15E, with the 1,200-foot elevation line on the western edge of the San Juan Valley; then

(6) Proceed southerly then easterly along the 1,200-foot elevation line to the elevation line's first intersection with the eastern boundary line of section 13, T27S/R15E; then

(7) Proceed south along the eastern boundary line of section 13, T27S/R15E, approximately 0.2 mile to the section 13 boundary line's second intersection with an unnamed unimproved road; then

(8) Proceed southeasterly on the unnamed unimproved road approximately 3 miles as it follows the southwestern edge of the San Juan Valley to the road's intersection with the eastern boundary line of section 29, T27S/R16E; then

(9) Proceed south along the eastern boundary line of section 29, T27S/R16E, approximately 0.3 mile to the section line's intersection with the 1,300-foot elevation line; then

(10) Proceed southeasterly along the 1,300-foot elevation line approximately 3.7 miles as it follows the southwestern edge of the San Juan Valley, crossing onto the Holland Canyon map, to the elevation line's first intersection with the eastern boundary line of section 3, T28S/R16E; then

(11) Proceed south along the eastern boundary line of section 3, T28S/R16E, approximately 0.55 mile to the section boundary line's fifth intersection with the 1,300-foot elevation line (northwest of Pear Tree Spring); then

(12) Proceed southeasterly along the 1,300-foot elevation line approximately 1.3 miles to the elevation line's intersection with an unnamed tributary of San Juan Creek (approximately 0.35 mile east of the 1,686-foot San Juan peak), section 11, T28S/R16E; then

(13) Proceed southerly in a straight line approximately 0.6 mile, crossing onto the La Panza Ranch map, to the northwestern corner of section 13, T28S/R16E; then

(14) Proceed east along the northern boundary line of section 13, T28S/R16E, approximately 0.7 mile to the section boundary line's intersection with an unnamed unimproved road; then

(15) Proceed south-southeasterly on the unnamed unimproved road approximately 0.85 mile to the road's intersection with the eastern boundary line of section 13, T28S/R16E, which is concurrent with the R16E/R17E common boundary line; then

(16) Proceed south along the R16E/R17E common boundary line approximately 3.35 miles to the southeast corner of section 36, T28S/R16E, which is concurrent with the eastern-most intersection of the R16E/R17E and T28S/T29S common boundary lines; then
