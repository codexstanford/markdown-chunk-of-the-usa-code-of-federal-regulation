####### Superseding bonds.

(a)Superseding bonds will be required in case of insolvency or removal of any surety, and may, at the discretion of the appropriate TTB officer, be required in any other contingency affecting the validity or impairing the efficiency of such bond. Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, continuing or liquidating the business of the principal, must execute and file a superseding bond or obtain the consent of the surety or sureties on the existing bond or bonds. Where, under the provisions of § 28.72, the surety on any bond given under this subpart has filed an application to be relieved of liability under said bond and the principal desires or intends to continue the business or operations to which such bond relates, he must file a valid superseding bond to be effective on or before the date specified in the surety's notice. If the principal does not file a superseding bond when required, he must discontinue the operations intended to be covered by such bond forthwith. Superseding bonds must show the date of execution and the effective date.
