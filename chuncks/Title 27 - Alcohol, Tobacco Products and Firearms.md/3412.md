Packages shall be numbered with a package identification number or serial number in accordance with § 20.179 (b) or (c). Packages shall be labeled with the name, address, and permit number of the manufacturer, the quantity (in gallons) of spirits contained in the package, and the applicable words "Recovered denatured alcohol formula No. ____" or "Recovered specially denatured rum formula No. ____." If the restoration or redenaturation is performed by a user or dealer permittee (not a distilled spirits plant), the permittee shall return the same materials to the same manufacturer and shall not intermingle them with materials received from other sources.
