#### PART 4 - LABELING AND ADVERTISING OF WINE
##### Subpart F - Requirements for Approval of Labels of Wine Domestically Bottled or Packed
###### § 4.52 Photoprints.

Photoprints or other reproductions of certificates of label approval or certificates of exemption are not acceptable, for the purposes of §§ 4.50 through 4.52, as substitutes for an original or duplicate original of a certificate of label approval, or a certificate of exemption. The appropriate TTB officer will, upon the request of the bottler or packer, issue duplicate originals of certificates of label approval or of certificates of exemption if wine under the same brand is bottled or packed at more than one plant by the same person, and if the necessity for the duplicate originals is shown and there is listed with the appropriate TTB officer the name and address of the additional bottling or packing plant where the particular label is to be used.
