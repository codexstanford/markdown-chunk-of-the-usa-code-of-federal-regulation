####### § 71.107 Application proceedings.

If, upon receipt of the record and the recommended decision of the administrative law judge, the appropriate TTB officer decides that the permit should be issued, he shall thereupon approve the application briefly stating, for the record, his reasons therefor, but if he contemplates the disapproval of the application he shall serve a copy of the administrative law judge's recommended decision on the applicant, informing the applicant of his contemplated action and affording the applicant not more than 10 days in which to submit proposed findings and conclusions or exceptions to the recommended decision with reasons in support thereof. If the appropriate TTB officer, after consideration of the record of the hearing and of any proposed findings, conclusions or exceptions filed with him by the applicant, approves the findings, conclusions and recommended decision of the administrative law judge, he shall by order approve or disapprove of the application in accordance therewith. If, after such consideration, he disapproves of the findings, conclusions and recommended decision of the administrative law judge, in whole or in part, he shall by order make such findings and conclusions as in his opinion are warranted by the law and facts in the record. Any decision of the appropriate TTB officer ordering the disapproval of an application for a permit shall state the findings and conclusions upon which it is based, including his ruling upon each proposed finding, conclusion and exception to the administrative law judge's recommended decision, together with a statement of his findings and conclusions, and reasons or basis therefor, upon all material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record. A signed duplicate original of the decision shall be served upon the applicant and the original copy containing certificate of service shall be placed in the official record of the proceeding.
