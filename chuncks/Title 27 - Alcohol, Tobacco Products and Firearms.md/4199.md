###### Bonds and Consents of Surety
####### § 24.157 Application by surety for relief from bond.

A surety on any bond required by this part may at any time, in writing, notify the principal and the appropriate TTB officer in whose office the bond is on file, that it desires after a specified date, to be relieved of liability under the bond. The date may not be less than 10 days after the date notice is received by the appropriate TTB officer in the case of a tax deferral bond, and not less than 90 days after the date the notice is received in the case of a bonded wine premises bond or wine vinegar plant bond. The surety will also file with the appropriate TTB officer an acknowledgment, or other evidence of service, of a notice on the principal. The 10 day or 90 day period does not commence until both the acknowledgment or other evidence of service and the notice are filed. If a notice is not thereafter withdrawn in writing, the rights of the principal as supported by the bond will be terminated on the date specified in the notice, and the surety will be relieved from liability to the extent set forth in § 24.158.
