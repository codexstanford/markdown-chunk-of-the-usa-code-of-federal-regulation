(2) Thence along the 800-foot contour line in an easterly and then generally a northeasterly direction through section 27 and then back across the northwest corner of section 26 and thence in a generally northwesterly direction along the 800-foot contour line across sections 23, 22 and into section 15.

(3) Thence along the 800-foot contour line in a northerly and then a southerly direction across section 22 and eventually in a generally northwesterly direction into section 20.

(8) Thence in a generally northeasterly and then southerly direction along the 1600-foot contour line through section 16 and then through the southeast and southwest corners of sections 9 and 10 respectively to the intersection of the 1600-foot contour line with Jamison Creek in section 16 (T. 9S., R. 3W.).

(9) Thence in an easterly direction along the south bank of Jamison Creek across sections 15 and 14 (T. 9S., R. 3W.) to the intersection of Jamison Creek and the 800-foot contour line in the southeast corner of section 14 (T. 9S., R. 3W.).

(10) Thence in a southeasterly direction in a meandering manner along the 800-foot contour line across sections 14, 23, 24, 25 (T. 9S., R. 3W.), sections 30 and 31 (T. 9S., R. 2W.), and sections 32, 5, 8, 9, 16, 17 and 21 (T. 10S., R. 2W.).

(12) Thence continuing along the 800-foot contour line in a generally southerly and then a generally northwesterly direction through sections 25, 36, 31 and 36 to the point of beginning at the intersection of sections 25, 26, 35 and 36 (T. 10S., R. 3W.).
