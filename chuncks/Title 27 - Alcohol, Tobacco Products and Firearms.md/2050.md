###### § 17.108 Superseding bonds.

(a) The principal on any bond filed pursuant to this part may at any time replace it with a superseding bond.

(b) Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting in a fiduciary capacity continuing or liquidating the business of the principal, shall execute and file a superseding bond or obtain the consent of the surety or sureties on the existing bond or bonds.

(c) When, in the opinion of the appropriate TTB officer, the interests of the Government demand it, or in any case where the security of the bond becomes impaired in whole or in part for any reason whatever, the principal shall file a superseding bond. A superseding bond shall be filed immediately in case of the insolvency of the surety. If a bond is found to be not acceptable or for any reason becomes invalid or of no effect, the principal shall immediately file a satisfactory superseding bond.

(d) A bond filed under this section to supersede an existing bond shall be marked by the obligors at the time of execution, "Superseding Bond." When such a bond is approved, the superseded bond shall be released as to transactions occurring wholly subsequent to the effective date of the superseding bond, and notice of termination of the superseded bond shall be issued, as provided in § 17.111.
