####### § 26.74 Release of pledged securities or cash (including cash equivalents).

Securities of the United States pledged and deposited as provided in § 26.63(a), will be released only in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR part 225. Securities and cash (including cash equivalents) will not be released by the appropriate TTB officer until the liability under the bond for which they were pledged has been terminated. When the appropriate TTB officer is satisfied that they may be released, the appropriate TTB officer will fix the date or dates on which a part or all of such securities and cash (including cash equivalents) may be released. At any time prior to the release, the appropriate TTB officer may extend the date of release for such additional length of time as the appropriate TTB officer deems necessary.
