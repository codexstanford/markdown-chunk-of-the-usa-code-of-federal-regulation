Beer may be removed for research, development or testing in packages or in bulk containers.

(b) The brewer shall mark each barrel, keg, case, or shipping container with the name and address of the brewer and of the consignee, the identity of the product, and the quantity of the product.

If beer is removed in a bulk conveyance, the brewer shall place the marks on the route board of the conveyance.
