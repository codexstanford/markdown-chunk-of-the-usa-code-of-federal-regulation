####### § 40.284 Remission of tax liability.

Remission of the tax liability on tobacco products may be extended to the manufacturer liable for the tax where tobacco products in bond are lost (otherwise than by theft) or destroyed, by fire, casualty, or act of God, while in the possession or ownership of such manufacturer. Where tobacco products are so lost or destroyed the manufacturer shall report promptly such fact, and the circumstances, to the appropriate TTB officer. If the manufacturer wishes to be relieved of the tax liability thereon he shall also prepare a claim on TTB F 5620.8, in duplicate, setting forth the nature, date, place, and extent of the loss or destruction. Both copies of the claim, accompanied by such evidence as is necessary to establish to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer that the claim is valid, shall be filed with the appropriate TTB officer. Upon action on the claim by the appropriate TTB officer he will return the copy of TTB F 5620.8 to the manufacturer as notice of such action, which copy shall be retained by the manufacturer.
