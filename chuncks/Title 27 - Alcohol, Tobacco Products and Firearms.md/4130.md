###### Application
####### § 24.106 Basic permit requirements.

Any person intending to engage in the business of producing or blending wine or purchasing wine for resale at wholesale is required under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act, as amended (49 Stat. 978; 27 U.S.C. 203) to obtain a basic permit. A State, a political subdivision of a State, or officers or employees of a State or political subdivision acting in their official capacity are exempted from this requirement. The issuance of a basic permit under the Act is governed by regulations in 27 CFR part 1. Where a basic permit is required to engage in an operation, an application for a basic permit will be filed at the time of filing an original or amended application on TTB F 5120.25. Operations requiring a basic permit may not be conducted until the basic permit application is approved. No Wine Producer's and Blender's Basic Permit or Wine Blender's Basic Permit is required for a bonded wine cellar established only for the purpose of storing untaxpaid wine even though an approved application, TTB F 5120.25, and bond are required.
