###### Determination of Quantity by Weight
####### § 30.41 Bulk spirits.

When spirits (including denatured spirits) are to be gauged by weight in bulk quantities, the weight shall be determined by means of weighing tanks, mounted on accurate scales. Before each use, the scales shall be balanced at zero load; thereupon the spirits shall be run into the weighing tank and proofed as prescribed in § 30.31. However, if the spirits are to be reduced in proof, the spirits shall be so reduced before final determination of the proof. The scales shall then be brought to a balanced condition and the weight of the spirits determined by reading the beam to the nearest graduation mark. From the weight and the proof thus ascertained, the quantity of the spirits in proof gallons shall be determined by reference to Table 4. However, in the case of spirits which contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters, the quantity in proof gallons shall be determined by first ascertaining the wine gallons per pound of the spirits and multiplying the wine gallons per pound by the weight, in pounds, of the spirits being gauged and by the true proof (determined as prescribed in § 30.31) and dividing the result by 100. The wine gallons per pound of spirits containing solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters shall be ascertained by:

(a) Use of a precision hydrometer and thermometer, in accordance with the provisions of § 30.23, to determine the apparent proof of the spirits (if specific gravity at the temperature of the spirits is not more than 1.0) and reference to Table 4 for the wine gallons per pound, or

(b) Use of a specific gravity hydrometer, in accordance with the provisions of § 30.25, to determine the specific gravity of the spirits (if the specific gravity at the temperature of the spirits is more than 1.0) and dividing that specific gravity (corrected to 60 degrees Fahrenheit) into the factor 0.120074 (the wine gallons per pound for water at 60 degrees Fahrenheit). When withdrawing a portion of the contents of a weighing tank, the difference between the quantity (ascertained by proofing and weighing) in the tank immediately before the removal of the spirits and the quantity (ascertained by proofing and weighing) in the tank immediately after the removal of the spirits shall be the quantity considered to be withdrawn.
