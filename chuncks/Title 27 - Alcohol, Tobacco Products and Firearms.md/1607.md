From the beginning point, proceed easterly along the Lake Michigan shoreline to Northport and then continue southerly along the meandering shoreline, passing in succession over the Kewaunee, Manitowoc, and Sheboygan County maps and onto the Ozaukee County map to the intersection of the Lake Michigan shoreline with a line drawn as an easterly extension of County Highway T (locally known as Lakefield Road), east of Cedarburg; then

(2) Proceed west on County Highway T through Cedarburg, crossing onto the Washington County map, passing over the North Western railroad single track, and continuing to the intersection of County Highway T with U.S. Route 45; then

(3) Proceed north on U.S. Route 45 to the intersection of U.S. Route 45 with State Road 60, south of Hasmer Lake; then

(6) Proceed northerly on U.S. Route 151, passing through Waupun onto the Fond du Lac County map, and continue northeasterly into the City of Fond du Lac to the point where U.S. Route 151 turns east, and, from that point, continue north in a straight line to the south shore of Lake Winnebago in Lakeside Park; then

(7) Proceed easterly along the southern shoreline of Lake Winnebago, then northerly along the eastern shoreline, crossing onto the Calumet County map, to the intersection of the shoreline with a line drawn as a southerly extension of County Highway N at Highland Beach in Harrison Township; then

(8) Proceed north on County Highway N, crossing onto the Outagamie County map, to the intersection of County Highway N with the Fox River; then

(9) Proceed northeasterly (downstream) along the Fox River, crossing onto the Brown County map, until the Fox River meets the southern shoreline of Green Bay; and then

(10) Proceed northeasterly along the eastern shoreline of Green Bay, passing over the Kewaunee County map and onto the Door County map, to Sister Bay, where the eastern shoreline of Green Bay becomes the shoreline of Lake Michigan, and then continue northeasterly along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, returning to the beginning point.
