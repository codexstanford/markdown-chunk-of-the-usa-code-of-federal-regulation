(3) Thence south along the R9W/R10W range line approximately 2.75 miles to the center of the Umpqua River; thence along a straight line in an easterly direction approximately 6.25 miles to the intersection of range line R8W/R9W with the center of the Umpqua River; thence south along range line R8W/R9W approximately 3.5 miles to its intersection with township line T22S/T23S;

(4) Thence southeast approximately 8.5 miles along a straight line to the intersection of township line T23S/T24S with range line R7W/R8W; thence south along the R7W/R8W range line approximately 8 miles to its intersection with the 1,000-foot contour line; thence in a southeasterly direction in a straight line approximately 3.5 miles toward the intersection of township line T25S/T26S with range line R6W/R7W, returning to the 1,000-foot contour line;

(5) Thence in a southerly direction along the 1,000-foot contour line to the intersection of township line T27S/T28S with range line R7W/R8W; thence in a southwesterly direction in a straight line approximately 3.5 miles toward the intersection of township line T28S/T29S with range line R8W/R9W, returning to the 1,000-foot contour line; thence south along the 1,000-foot contour line to its intersection with township line T29S/T30S;

(6) Thence east along township line T29S/T30S approximately .33 miles, rejoining the 1,000-foot contour line; thence in a northerly and eventually a southerly direction along the 1,000-foot contour line past the town of Riddle on the "Medford" map to range line R6W/R7W; thence south along the R6W/R7W range line approximately .5 miles back to the 1,000-foot contour line;

(7) Thence in an easterly, westerly, and eventually a northerly direction along the 1,000-foot contour line to a point approximately 3.5 miles east of Dillard, where the contour line crosses Interstate Highway 5 on the "Roseburg" map; thence northeast along Interstate Highway 5 approximately .25 mile, returning to the 1,000-foot contour line; thence in a generally northeasterly, southeasterly, northwesterly, and eventually a northeasterly direction along the 1,000-foot contour line past the town of Idleyld Park to the R2W/R3W range line;

(8) Thence north along range line R2W/R3W approximately 1.75 miles to the T25S/T26S township line; thence west along township line T25S/T26S approximately .25 mile, returning to the 1,000-foot contour line; thence in a generally westerly and then a northerly direction along the 1,000-foot contour line up the valley of Calapooya Creek to the R3W/R4W range line; thence north along range line R3W/R4W approximately 2.25 miles, back to the 1,000-foot contour line;

(9) Thence in a westerly and then a northerly direction along the 1,000-foot contour line to the T23S/T24S township line; thence east along the T23S/T24S township line approximately 2.75 miles to the 1,000-foot contour line; thence in a northerly direction along the 1,000-foot contour line to its intersection with the Douglas/Lane County line; thence north along the Douglas/Lane County line approximately .75 mile to the point of beginning.
