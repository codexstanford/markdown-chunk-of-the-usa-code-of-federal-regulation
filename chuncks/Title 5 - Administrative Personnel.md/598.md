(2) Testify as to facts when the General Counsel determines such testimony would not be in the best interest of OPM or the United States; or

(3) For a current OPM employee, testify as an expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of OPM unless testimony is being given on behalf of the United States.
