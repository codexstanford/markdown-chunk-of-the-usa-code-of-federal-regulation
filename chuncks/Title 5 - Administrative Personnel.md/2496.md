###### § 534.505 Written procedures.

(a) Each agency with positions subject to this subpart must establish written procedures for setting the rate of basic pay and increasing the rate of basic pay of incumbents of the positions in accordance with law and this subpart. Agencies must provide for transparency in the processes for making pay decisions, while assuring confidentiality. The agency's plan for setting and increasing rates of basic pay must reflect meaningful distinctions among SL and ST employees based on individual performance, contribution to agency performance, or both, and must include-

(1) The criteria that will be used to set and increase a senior professional's rate of basic pay to ensure that individual pay rates or pay increases, as well as their overall distribution within the senior professional pay range, reflect meaningful distinctions within a single performance level (e.g., the higher the employee's relative performance within a rating level, the higher the pay increase), between performance rating levels (e.g., the higher the rating level, the higher the pay increase), or both;

(2) The criteria that will be used to set and increase a senior professional's rate of basic pay at a rate that exceeds the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if the applicable agency performance appraisal system has been certified under part 430, subpart D of this chapter;

(3) Any system, methods, or criteria the agency uses to establish pay ranges applicable to various SL or ST positions within the pay range that applies under § 534.504(a), consistent with the requirement that pay be determined based upon individual performance, contributions to the agency's performance, or both;

(4) The designation of the authorized agency official(s) who will have the authority to set and adjust rates of basic pay for SL and ST employees, subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section; and

(5) The administrative and management controls that will be applied to assure compliance with applicable statutes, OPM regulations, the agency's written procedures established under this section, the applicable maximum rate of basic pay in § 534.504(a), and, where applicable, the certification requirements set forth in part 430, subpart D of this chapter. In an agency that employs ten or more senior professionals, these controls must include centralized review of ratings proposed under § 430.208 of this chapter and pay actions proposed under § 534.507 by a panel of individuals designated by the agency head to provide advice from an agency-wide perspective for authorized agency officials to consider before approving pay adjustments on whether-

(i) Ratings of record and performance ratings proposed for senior professionals accurately reflect their individual performance, contributions to agency performance, or both, and take into account, as appropriate, assessment of the agency's performance against program performance measures and other relevant considerations; and

(ii) Proposed pay adjustments for senior professionals conform to the requirements of § 534.507 and appropriately correspond to proposed ratings of record and performance ratings.

(b) Each agency's written procedure must provide that, effective at the beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing on or after the first day of the month in which an adjustment takes effect under 5 U.S.C. 5303 in the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule, the head of an agency will adjust a senior professional's rate of basic pay under the provisions of § 534.507.

(c) The following actions must be approved by the agency head or by a designee who provides the certifications described in § 430.404(a)(6)(i), (ii) and (iii) of this chapter for all senior professionals in the agency, and this approval authority may not be further delegated:

(1) Any pay-setting action under § 534.506 or any pay increase under § 534.507 that results in a rate of basic pay that is within the highest 10 percent of the applicable rate range under § 534.504. A rate of basic pay equal to or above the amount derived using the following rules is considered to be within the highest 10 percent of the applicable pay range (in 2015, $177,166 or above if the applicable system is certified, or $164,026 or above if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply):

(i) Subtract the minimum rate of basic pay from the maximum rate of basic pay for the applicable rate range under § 534.504 (in 2015, $183,300-$121,956 = $61,344 if the applicable system is certified, or $168,700-$121,956 = $46,744 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply);

(ii) Multiply the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by 0.10 (in 2015, $61,344 - 0.10 = $6,134 if the applicable system is certified, or $46,744 - 0.10 = $4,674 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply); and

(iii) Subtract the amount derived in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section from the maximum rate of basic pay applicable under § 534.504 (in 2015, $183,300-$6,134 = $177,166 if the applicable system is certified, or $168,700-$4,674 = $164,026 if the applicable system is not certified or performance appraisal does not apply);

(2) Any pay increase under § 534.507 that results in a rate of basic pay more than 10 percent above the SL or ST employee's rate of basic pay as in effect on the last day of the preceding fiscal year or, if the individual was first appointed as an SL or ST employee in the agency after the last day of the preceding fiscal year, more than 10 percent above the rate of basic pay set at the time of that appointment. A rate of basic pay more than 10 percent above the applicable rate of basic pay is considered to be any rate of basic pay that exceeds the amount derived by multiplying the applicable rate of basic pay by a factor of 1.1;

(3) Any pay-setting action under § 534.506(c)(2) that results in a higher rate of basic pay than the senior professional had upon leaving the agency; and

(4) Any off-cycle pay increase under § 534.510.

(d) An agency must keep its written procedures for setting and increasing rates of basic pay up to date, make them available to affected SL and ST employees, periodically provide training or supplemental guidance to clarify how they are applied, and provide a copy to OPM upon request.

(e)(1) The head of an agency may delegate to an Inspector General the authority to set and adjust pay for senior professionals in the Office of the Inspector General, including authority for pay actions described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) An agency head who delegates to an Inspector General the authority to set and adjust pay for all senior professionals in the Office of the Inspector General, including all pay actions described in paragraph (c) of this section, may exclude those senior professionals from the count of agency senior professionals for the purpose of determining whether centralized review under paragraph (a)(5) of this section is required.

(3) An Inspector General to whom an agency head delegates authority to set and adjust pay for 10 or more senior professionals in the Office of the Inspector General must provide the centralized review required by paragraph (a)(5) of this section and may use Federal employees from outside the agency for that purpose or from the Inspector General community, whether or not in the same agency.

(f)(1) A panel performing centralized review under paragraphs (a)(5) or (e)(3) of this section for a senior professional who holds a career or career-conditional appointment or an appointment of equivalent tenure in the excepted service must have a majority of career appointees.

(2) For the purpose of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a career appointee is considered to be a career SES member or a senior professional who holds a career or career-conditional appointment or an appointment of equivalent tenure in the excepted service.

(3) An agency head may include Federal employees from outside the agency on a panel performing centralized review.

(4) An agency using the discretion provided in § 430.403(d) of this chapter must do so in accordance with paragraphs (a)(5), (e) and (f) of this section, as applicable.
