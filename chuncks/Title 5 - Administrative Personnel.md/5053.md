(5) If the employee has not retired under CSRS or FERS or died, the mailing address of the employee.

(i) That a remarriage has not occurred;

(ii) That the former spouse will notify OPM within 15 calendar days of the occurrence of any remarriage; and

(iii) That the former spouse will be personally liable for any overpayment to him or her resulting from a remarriage.
