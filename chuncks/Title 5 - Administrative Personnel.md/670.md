(a) The purpose of a commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service is to serve as an additional source of applicants. Once recruited, applicants must be evaluated and appointed through regular civil service employment procedures.

(1) For a competitive service position, an individual must be appointed in accordance with the terms of applicable competitive service procedures.

(2) For an excepted service position, an individual must be appointed in accordance with the terms of the applicable appointing authority and the requirements set out in part 302 of this chapter.

(3) For a Senior Executive Service position filled by career appointment, an individual must be appointed in accordance with the competitive process described in 5 U.S.C. 3393.

(b) In order to use commercial recruiting firms or nonprofit employment services, agencies are required to:

(1) Make known that applicants may apply directly to the Government and thus need not apply through the commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service;

(2) Give the same consideration to candidates who have applied directly and candidates referred from the commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service; and

(3) Follow all requirements for appointment, including veterans preference, where applicable.
