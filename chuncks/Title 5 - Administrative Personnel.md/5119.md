##### Subpart H - Requirements for Court Orders Awarding Former Spouse Survivor Annuities
###### § 838.807 Cost must be paid by annuity reduction.

(a) A court order awarding a former spouse survivor annuity is not a court order acceptable for processing unless it permits OPM to collect the annuity reduction required by 5 U.S.C. 8339(j)(4) or 8419 from annuity paid by OPM to a retiree. OPM will not honor a court order that provides for the retiree or former spouse to pay OPM the amount of the annuity reduction by any other means.

(b) The amount of the annuity reduction required by section 8339(j)(4) or section 8419 of title 5, United States Code, may be paid-

(1) By reduction of the former spouse's entitlement under a court order acceptable for processing that is directed at employee annuity payable to a retiree;

(2) By reduction of the employee annuity payable to a retiree; or

(3) By actuarial reduction of the former spouse survivor annuity in the event the reduction of the employee annuity is not made for any reason prior to the death of the annuitant.

(c) Unless the court order otherwise directs, OPM will collect the annuity reduction required by 5 U.S.C. 8339(j)(4) or 8419 from the employee annuity payable to a retiree.
