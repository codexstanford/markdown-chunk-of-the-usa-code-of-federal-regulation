###### § 870.909 Designations and changes of beneficiary.

(a)(1) An assignment automatically cancels an insured individual's prior designation of beneficiary. After making an assignment, an individual cannot designate a beneficiary; the right to designate beneficiaries transfers to the assignee.

(2) Each assignee may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive insurance benefits upon the death of the insured individual and may also later change the beneficiaries. An assignee may designate himself/herself the primary beneficiary and name another contingent beneficiary(ies) to receive insurance benefits if the assignee dies before the insured individual.

(b) Benefits for assigned insurance are paid to the assignee(s) if the assignee(s) did not designate a beneficiary.

(c) Benefits for assigned insurance are paid to an assignee's estate if the assignee dies before the insured individual and:

(1) The assignee (or the assignee's heirs) did not designate a beneficiary; or

(2) The assignee's designated beneficiary dies before the insured individual.

(d) The provisions of § 870.802 apply to designations of beneficiary made by assignees.
