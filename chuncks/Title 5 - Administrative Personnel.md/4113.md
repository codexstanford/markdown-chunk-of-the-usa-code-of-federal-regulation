##### § 730.104 Notification.

(a) Agencies must provide written notification to senior executives and other individuals covered by the amendment to 18 U.S.C. 207(c)(2)(A)(ii) that they are subject to the post-employment conflict-of-interest restrictions in 18 U.S.C. 207, before, or as part of, any personnel action that affects the employee's coverage under 18 U.S.C. 207(c)(1), including when employment or service in a covered position is terminated. A copy of the written notice must be provided simultaneously to the Designated Agency Ethics Official (or his or her delegate). The written notice must include information on the applicable penalties or injunctions that may be imposed under 18 U.S.C. 216(a), (b), and (c) for violations of the post-employment restrictions in 18 U.S.C. 207(c). The notice also must indicate that employees covered by 18 U.S.C. 207(c) are subject to 18 U.S.C. 207(f), which imposes additional post-employment restrictions on representing, aiding, or advising certain foreign entities.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the post-employment restrictions in 18 U.S.C. 207(c) apply to covered employees without regard to whether they receive written notice from their employing agency.
