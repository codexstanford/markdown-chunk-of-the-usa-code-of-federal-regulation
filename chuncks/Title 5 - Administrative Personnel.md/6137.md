(a) For the purpose of 5 U.S.C. chapter 84, subchapter IV-

(1) The death of a phased retiree is deemed to be a death in service of an employee; and

(2) The phased retirement period is deemed to have been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in § 848.202(a)(1) and (b) for the purpose of determining survivor benefits. The part-time proration adjustment for the phased retirement period will be based upon the employee's officially established part-time work schedule, with no credit for extra hours worked.

No pay received for other hours during the phased retirement period may be included as part of basic pay for the purpose of computing retirement benefits, notwithstanding the normally applicable rules.
