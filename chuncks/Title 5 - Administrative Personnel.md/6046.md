(c) A move from a NAFI to CSRS, including CSRS/SS as defined under § 846.102 of this chapter followed by an election of FERS coverage under § 846.201 of this chapter, is not a qualifying move for an election of retirement coverage under § 847.431 (pertaining to elections of NAFI service credit for FERS service) and § 847.441 (pertaining to elections of NAFI retirement coverage).

(d) A qualifying move under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is considered to occur on the date the individual entered into the new position, not at the time of separation from the prior position.
