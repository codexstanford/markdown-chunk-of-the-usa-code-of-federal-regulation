(a) Prior approval of OPM is not required to establish individual SL and ST positions within an allocation, but the positions must be established in accordance with the standards and procedures in paragraph (b) of this section. OPM reserves the right to require the prior approval of individual positions if the agency is not in compliance with these standards and procedures.

(b) Before an SL or ST position may be established, an agency must:

(1) Prepare a description of the duties, responsibilities, and supervisory relationships of the position; and

(2) Determine, consistent with published position classification standards and guides and accepted classification principles, that the position is properly classified above GS-15. In addition, for an ST position an agency must determine that the position meets the functional research and development criteria described in § 319.103.
