###### § 875.303 How are premium payment errors corrected?

(a) If the Carrier finds that you have underpaid the premium rate for your age and/or level of coverage, you must pay retroactive premiums to the Carrier for the amount due. If you fail to pay back premiums within the time provided by the Carrier to correct the error, the Carrier may terminate your coverage.

(b) If the Carrier finds that you have overpaid premiums, the Carrier will either reimburse you or reduce a future premium payment(s) by the amount of the overpayment.

(c) If you die while you have coverage, any premiums paid for the period beyond the date of your death will be refunded to your estate or to an alternate payee. If there is no estate, the Carrier will determine whether to pay the refund to an alternate payee. If you cancel your coverage, any premiums paid in advance for the period following the effective date of your cancellation will be refunded to you.

(d) Any premiums you paid will be returned if you cancel coverage within the "free look" period specified in the benefit booklet.
