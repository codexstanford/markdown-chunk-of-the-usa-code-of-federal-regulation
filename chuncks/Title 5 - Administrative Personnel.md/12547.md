###### § 9701.322 Setting and adjusting rate ranges.

(a) Within its sole and exclusive discretion, DHS may, after coordination with OPM, set and adjust the rate ranges established under § 9701.321 on an annual basis. In determining the rate ranges, DHS and OPM may consider mission requirements, labor market conditions, availability of funds, pay adjustments received by employees of other Federal agencies, and any other relevant factors.

(b) DHS may, after coordination with OPM, determine the effective date of newly set or adjusted band rate ranges. Unless DHS determines that a different effective date is needed for operational reasons, these adjustments will become effective on or about the date of the annual General Schedule pay adjustment authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5303.

(c) DHS may establish different rate ranges and provide different rate range adjustments for different bands.

(d) DHS may adjust the minimum and maximum rates of a band by different percentages.
