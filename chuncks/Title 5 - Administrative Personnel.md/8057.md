###### § 1205.32 Decision on appeal.

(a) The Chairman will decide the appeal within 30 workdays unless the Chairman determines that there is good cause for extension of that deadline. If an appeal is improperly labeled, does not contain the necessary information, or is submitted to an inappropriate official, the time period for processing that appeal will begin when the Chairman receives the appeal and the necessary information.

(b) If the request for amendment of a record is granted on appeal, the Chairman will direct that the amendment be made. A copy of the amended record will be provided to the requester.

(c) If the request for amendment of a record is denied, the Chairman will notify the requester of the denial and will inform the requester of:

(1) The basis for the denial;

(2) The right to judicial review of the decision under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A); and

(3) The right to file a concise statement with the Board stating the reasons why the requester disagrees with the denial. This statement will become a part of the requester's record.
