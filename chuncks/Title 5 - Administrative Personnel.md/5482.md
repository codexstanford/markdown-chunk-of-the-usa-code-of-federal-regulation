Such a covered individual is treated as if he or she were a Federal employee for purposes of this part, and of any other part within this title relating to FERS. The individual is entitled to the benefits of, and is subject to all conditions under, FERS on the same basis as if the individual were an employee of the Federal Government.

(b) Cessation of employment with the Corporation for any period terminates eligibility for coverage under FERS during any subsequent employment by the Corporation.

Such an election must be in writing and filed with the Corporation. It takes effect immediately when received by the Corporation. The election applies to any and all Federal benefits described by section 1622(a) of Public Law 104-106, 110 Stat. 521, and is irrevocable. The Corporation must transmit the election to OPM with the individual's retirement records.

(d) The Corporation must withhold from the pay of an individual described by paragraph (a) of this section an amount equal to the percentage withheld from the pay of a Federal employee for periods of service covered by FERS and, in accordance with procedures established by OPM, pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund the amounts deducted from the individual's pay.

(e) The Corporation must, in accordance with procedures established by OPM, pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund amounts equal to any agency contributions required under FERS.
