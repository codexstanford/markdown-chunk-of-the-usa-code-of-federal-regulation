## Chapter I - Office of Personnel Management
### Subchapter B - Civil Service Regulations
#### PART 353 - RESTORATION TO DUTY FROM UNIFORMED SERVICE OR COMPENSABLE INJURY
##### Subpart A - General Provisions
###### § 353.108 Effect of performance and conduct on restoration rights.

The laws covered by this part do not permit an agency to circumvent the protections afforded by other laws to employees who face the involuntary loss of their positions. Thus, an employee may not be denied restoration rights because of poor performance or conduct that occurred prior to the employee's departure for compensable injury or uniformed service. However, separation for cause that is substantially unrelated to the injury or to the performance of uniformed service negates restoration rights. Additionally, if during the period of injury or uniformed service the employee's conduct is such that it would disqualify him or her for employment under OPM or agency regulations, restoration rights may be denied.
