###### § 410.310 Computing time in training.

For the purpose of computing time in training for continued service agreements under section 4108 of title 5, United States Code:

(a) An employee on an 8-hour day work schedule assigned to training is counted as being in training for the same number of hours he or she is in pay status during the training assignment. If the employee is not in pay status during the training, the employee is counted as being in training for the number of hours he or she is granted leave without pay for the purpose of the training.

(b) For an employee on an alternative work schedule, the agency is responsible for determining the number of hours the employee is in pay status during the training assignment. If the employee is not in pay status during the training, the employee is counted as being in training for the number of hours he or she is granted leave without pay for the purpose of the training.

(c) An employee on an 8-hour or an alternative work schedule assigned to training on less than a full-time basis is counted as being in training for the number of hours he or she spends in class, in formal computer-based training, in satellite training, in formal self-study programs, or with the training instructor, unless a different method is determined by the agency.

(d) When an employee is pursuing an academic degree through an agency academic degree training program, an agency may compute the length of the academic degree training period based on the academic institution's established contact hours.
