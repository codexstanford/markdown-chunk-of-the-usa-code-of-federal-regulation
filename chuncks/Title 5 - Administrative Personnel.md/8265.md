###### § 1215.28 Administrative offset.

(a) The MSPB may collect debts owed by administrative offset if:

(1) The debt is certain in amount;

(2) Efforts to obtain direct payment have been, or would most likely be unsuccessful, or the MSPB and the debtor agree to the offset;

(3) Offset is cost effective or has significant deterrent value; and

(4) Offset is best suited to further and protect the Government's interest.

(b) The MSPB may offset a debt owed to another Federal agency from amounts due or payable by the MSPB to the debtor or request another Federal agency to offset a debt owed to the MSPB;

(c) Prior to initiating administrative offset, the MSPB will send the debtor written notice of the following:

(1) The nature and amount of the debt and the agency's intention to collect the debt by offset 30 days from the date the notice was mailed if neither payment nor a satisfactory response is received by that date;

(2) The debtor's right to an opportunity to submit a good faith alternative repayment schedule to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt, to request a review of the determination of indebtedness; and to enter into a written agreement to repay the debt; and

(3) The applicable interest.

(d) The MSPB may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by paragraph (c) of this section if:

(1) Failure of offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and

(2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit completion of those procedures.
