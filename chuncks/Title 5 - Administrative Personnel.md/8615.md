##### § 1320.15 Independent regulatory agency override authority.

(a) An independent regulatory agency which is administered by two or more members of a commission, board, or similar body, may by majority vote void:

(1) Any disapproval, instruction to such agency to make material or substantive change to, or stay of the effectiveness of OMB approval of, any collection of information of such agency; or

(2) An exercise of authority under § 1320.10(g) concerning such agency.

(b) The agency shall certify each vote to void such OMB action to OMB, and explain the reasons for such vote. OMB shall without further delay assign an OMB control number to such collection of information, valid for the length of time requested by the agency, up to three years, to any collection of information as to which this vote is exercised. No override shall become effective until the independent regulatory agency, as provided in § 1320.5(b) and § 1320.6(2), has displayed the OMB control number and informed the potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information that such persons are not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
