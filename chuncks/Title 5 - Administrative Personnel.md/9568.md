Requests made by mail shall be signed by the individual requesting his/her records. Inclusion of a telephone number for the requester is recommended to expedite certain matters. Requesters applying in person must provide an identification with photograph, such as a driver's license, military or annuitant identification card, or any official document as acceptable identification validation.
