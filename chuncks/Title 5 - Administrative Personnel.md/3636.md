####### § 610.122 Variations in work schedules for educational purposes.

(a) Notwithstanding § 610.121, the head of an agency may authorize a special tour of duty of not less than 40 hours to permit an employee to take one or more courses in a college, university, or other educational institution when it is determined that:

(1) The courses being taken are not training under chapter 41 of title 5, United States Code;

(2) The rearrangement of the employee's tour of duty will not appreciably interfere with the accomplishment of the work required to be performed;

(3) Additional costs for personal services will not be incurred; and

(4) Completion of the courses will equip the employee for more effective work in the agency.

(b) The agency may not pay to the employee any premium pay solely because the special tour of duty authorized under this section causes the employee to work on a day, or at a time during the day, for which premium pay would otherwise be payable.

(c) OPM may from time to time request an agency to report on the use of this authority.
