(1) In the competitive level;

(2) Temporarily promoted from the competitive level by temporary or term promotion; or

(3) Detailed from the competitive level under 5 U.S.C. 3341 or other appropriate authority.

(b)(1) The name of each employee serving under a time limited appointment or promotion to a position in a competitive level shall be entered on a list apart from the retention register for that competitive level, along with the expiration date of the action.

(2) The agency shall list, at the bottom of the list prepared under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the name of each employee in the competitive level with a written decision of removal under part 432 or 752 of this chapter.
