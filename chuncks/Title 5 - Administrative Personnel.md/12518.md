### PART 9701 - DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
#### Subpart B - Classification
##### Transitional Provisions
###### § 9701.231 Conversion of positions and employees to the DHS classification system.

(a) This section describes the transitional provisions that apply when DHS positions and employees are converted to a classification system established under this subpart. Affected positions and employees may convert from the GS system, a prevailing rate system, the SL/ST system, or the SES system, as provided in § 9701.202. For the purpose of this section, the terms "convert," "converted," "converting," and "conversion" refer to positions and employees that become covered by the classification system as a result of a coverage determination made under § 9701.102(b) and exclude employees who are reassigned or transferred from a noncovered position to a position already covered by the DHS system.

(b) DHS will issue implementing directives prescribing policies and procedures for converting the GS or prevailing rate grade of a position to a band and for converting SL/ST and SES positions to a band upon initial implementation of the DHS classification system. Such procedures must include provisions for converting an employee who is retaining a grade under 5 U.S.C. chapter 53, subchapter VI, immediately prior to conversion. As provided in § 9701.373, DHS must convert employees to the system without a reduction in their rate of pay (including basic pay and any applicable locality payment under 5 U.S.C. 5304, special rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305, locality rate supplement under § 9701.332, or special rate supplement under § 9701.333).
