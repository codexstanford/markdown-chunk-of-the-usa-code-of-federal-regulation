###### § 339.102 Purpose and effect.

(a) This part defines the circumstances under which OPM permits medical documentation to be required and examinations and/or evaluations conducted to determine the nature of a medical condition that affects safe and efficient performance.

(b) Personnel decisions based wholly or in part on the review of medical documentation, as defined below, and the results of medical examinations and evaluations must be made in accordance with appropriate sections of this part.

(c) Failure to meet medical (which may include psychological) standards and/or physical requirements established under this part means that the applicant or employee is not qualified for the position, unless reasonable accommodation or a waiver is appropriate, in accordance with §§ 339.103 and 339.204. An employee's refusal to be examined or provide medical documentation, as defined below, in accordance with a proper agency order authorized under this part, constitutes a basis for appropriate disciplinary or adverse action. After a tentative job offer of employment conditioned on completion of a medical examination, an applicant's refusal to be examined or provide medical documentation, as defined below, may result in the applicant's removal from further consideration for the position.
