The request for approval shall include the following:

(1) A brief description of the employee's official duties, a brief description of the proposed outside employment (including the name of the person, group or other organization for whom the work is to be performed), and a brief description of the employee's discipline or inherent area of expertise based on experience or educational background; and

(2) Responses to the following questions:

(i) Whether the proposed outside employment will draw on non-public information or pertain to a matter to which the employee is presently assigned or has been assigned within the last year;

(ii) Whether the proposed outside employment pertains to an ongoing or announced agency policy or program;

(iii) Whether the proposed outside employment will involve teaching a course which is part of the established curriculum of an accredited institution of higher education, secondary school, elementary school, or an education or training program sponsored by a Federal, State or local government entity;

(iv) Whether the sponsor of the proposed outside employment has any interests before the NEH that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's duties;

(v) Whether the employee intends to refer to his or her official NEH position during the proposed outside employment, and, if so, the text of any disclaimers that he or she will use; and

(vi) Whether the employee will receive any payment or compensation for the proposed activity, and, if so, how much.

(b) Approval shall be granted only upon determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.

(c) Outside employment means any form of compensated or uncompensated non-Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of personal services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited to, personal services such as acting as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher or speaker.
