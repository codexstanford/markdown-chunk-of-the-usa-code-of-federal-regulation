(1) The best timing in relation to wage adjustments in the principal local private enterprise establishments;

(2) Reasonable distribution of workload of the lead agency;

(3) The timing of surveys for nearby or selected wage areas; and

(4) Scheduling relationships with other pay surveys.

(e) The Office of Personnel Management may authorize adjustments in the normal cycle as requested by the lead agency and based on the criteria in paragraph (d) of this section or to accommodate special studies or adjustments consistent with determining local prevailing rates.

(f) The beginning month of appropriated and nonappropriated fund wage surveys and the fiscal year during which full-scale surveys will be conducted are set out as appendices A and B to this subpart and are incorporated in and made part of this section.
