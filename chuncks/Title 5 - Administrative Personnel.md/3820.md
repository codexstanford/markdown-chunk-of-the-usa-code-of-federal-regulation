###### § 630.1007 Approval of application to become a leave recipient.

(a) The leave bank board shall review an employee's application to become a leave recipient under procedures established by the agency for the purpose of determining whether the employee is a leave bank member who is or has been affected by a medical emergency.

(b) Before approving an application to become a leave recipient, the leave bank board shall determine that the absence from duty without available paid leave because of the medical emergency is (or is expected to be) at least 24 hours (or, in the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, at least 30 percent of the average number of hours in the employee's biweekly scheduled tour of duty).

(c) In making a determination as to whether a medical emergency is likely to result in a substantial loss of income, the leave bank board shall not consider factors other than whether the absence from duty without available paid leave is (or is expected to be) at least 24 hours (or, in the case of a part-time employee or an employee with an uncommon tour of duty, at least 30 percent of the average number of hours in the employee's biweekly scheduled tour of duty).

(d) The leave bank board shall provide timely written notification to the applicant of the action taken on the application. If the leave bank board disapproves the application, notification shall include the reasons for disapproval.

(e) The leave bank board may establish written policies limiting the amount of annual leave that may be granted to a leave recipient.
