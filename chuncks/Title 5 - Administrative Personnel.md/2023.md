###### § 511.602 Notification of classification decision.

An employee whose position is reclassified to a lower grade which is based in whole or in part on a classification decision is entitled to a prompt written notice from the agency. This includes employees who are eligible for retained grade or pay. If the reclassification is due to an Office classification certificate issued under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5110, the agency will also explain the reasons for the reclassification action to the employee. This notice shall inform the employee:

(a) Of his or her right to appeal the classification decision to the agency (if the agency has an established appeal system and it has the authority to review the classification decision), or to the Office as provided in this subpart if such an appeal has not already been made;

(b) Of the time limits within which the employee's appeal must be filed in order to preserve any retroactive benefits under § 511.703; and

(c) Any other appeal or grievance rights available under applicable law, rule, regulation or negotiated agreement.
