### PART 1630 - PRIVACY ACT REGULATIONS
#### § 1630.13 Procedures for review of determination to deny access to or amendment of records.

(a) Individuals who disagree with the refusal to grant them access to or to amend a record about them should submit a written request for review to the Executive Director, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. The words "PRIVACY ACT-APPEAL" should be written on the letter and the envelope. Individuals who need assistance preparing their appeal should contact the Board's Privacy Act Officer.

(b) The appeal letter must be received by the Board within 30 calendar days from the date the requester received the notice of denial. At a minimum, the appeal letter should identify:

(1) The records involved;

(2) The date of the initial request for access to or amendment of the record;

(3) The date of the Board's denial of that request; and

(4) The reasons supporting the request for reversal of the Board's decision.

(c) The Board reserves the right to dispose of correspondence concerning the request to access or amend a record if no request for review of the Board's decision is received within 180 days of the decision date. Therefore, a request for review received after 180 days may, at the discretion of the Privacy Act Officer, be treated as an initial request to access or amend a record.
