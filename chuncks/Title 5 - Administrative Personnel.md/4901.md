(a) If an employee or Member who elects an alternative form of annuity owes a deposit or redeposit for civilian service, and elects to pay that deposit or redeposit before the date of final adjudication, OPM will compute the annuity as if the deposit or redeposit had been made and will deem that deposit or redeposit to be included in the lump-sum credit for the purpose of computing the reduction in annuity under § 831.2205.

(b) The amount of a deposit or redeposit deemed paid under paragraph (a) of this section will include any interest owed by the employee or Member under 5 U.S.C. 8334.

(c) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section, "redeposit" does not include a redeposit owed for service for which credit is allowed pursuant to § 831.303(c)(1).
