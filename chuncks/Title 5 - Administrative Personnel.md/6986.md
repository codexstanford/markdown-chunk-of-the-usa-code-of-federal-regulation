###### § 892.201 Who is covered by the premium conversion plan?

(a) All employees in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government who are participating in the FEHB Program (as described in 5 U.S.C. 8901), and whose pay is issued by an agency of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, are automatically covered by the premium conversion plan. Certain reemployed annuitants may be considered employees for purposes of premium conversion, as described in subpart D of this part.

(b) Employees of organizations that have established a premium conversion plan under separate authority prior to October 2000 may not participate in the premium conversion plan described here because they are already covered by their employing agency's plan.

(c) Individuals enrolled in FEHB who are not employees of the Executive Branch of the Federal government or are not employees of the Federal government, will be covered by the premium conversion plan if their employer signs an adoption agreement that is accepted by OPM.

(d) Individuals enrolled in FEHB who are appointed by an agency in the Executive Branch, but whose pay is not issued by that agency, will be covered by the premium conversion plan if the entity that makes their FEHB contribution signs an adoption agreement that is accepted by OPM.

(e) Individuals may waive premium conversion by filing a waiver form with their employer in accordance with this part.
