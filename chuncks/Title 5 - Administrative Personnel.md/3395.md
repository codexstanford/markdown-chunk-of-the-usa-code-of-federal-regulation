##### Subpart E - Extended Assignment Incentives
###### § 575.507 What is the maximum extended assignment incentive that may be paid for a period of service?

(a) The total amount of extended assignment incentive payments that may be paid for a service period may not exceed the greater of-

(1) An amount equal to 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the employee at the beginning of the service period times the number of years (including fractions of a year) in the service period; or

(2) $15,000 per year (including fractions of a year) in the service period.

(b) For hourly rate employees who do not have a scheduled annual rate of basic pay, the annual rate in paragraph (a) of this section is computed by multiplying the applicable hourly rate in effect at the beginning of the service period by 2,087 hours.

(c) The number of years in the service period is computed by dividing the total number of calendar days in the service period (as established under § 575.510(a)) by 365 and rounding the result to two decimal places. For example, a service period covering 39 biweekly pay periods equals 546 days, and 546 days divided by 365 days equals 1.50 years.
