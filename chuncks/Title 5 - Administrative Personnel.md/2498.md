###### § 534.507 Annual increases in basic pay.

(a)(1) Effective at the beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing on or after the first day of the month in which an adjustment takes effect under 5 U.S.C. 5303 in the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule, the head of an agency must adjust a senior professional's rate of basic pay under paragraph (b) of this section by an amount he or she considers appropriate, subject to the applicable maximum rate under § 534.504(a), the agency's written procedures under § 534.505, and the provisions of this section.

(2) A determination by an authorized agency official to make a zero adjustment in pay after reviewing a senior professional's current rating of record or performance rating meets the requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if the notice required by paragraph (h) of this section is provided to the senior professional.

(3) A pay adjustment under paragraph (a)(1) or a determination under paragraph (a)(2) of this section does not restrict the authority of an agency head to increase pay at other times under § 534.510, if warranted.

(b)(1) An agency may provide a pay increase to a senior professional only upon a determination by the authorized agency official that the senior professional's performance and/or contributions to agency performance so warrant.

(2) Increases resulting in a rate of basic pay that exceeds the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, but is less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule, are reserved for those senior professionals who demonstrate the highest levels of individual performance, make the greatest contributions to the agency's performance, or both, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance management system.

(3) A pay increase must reflect the agency's judgment concerning the value of the employee's characteristic and continuing service to the agency in the SL or ST position. A single noteworthy contribution that is not characteristic of the employee's continuing performance requirements, individual performance or contributions to the agency's performance should be recognized by an appropriate award under part 451, subpart A of this chapter or other appropriate authority, rather than by a permanent increase in the rate of basic pay.

(c) An agency must document the basis for each pay increase granted under paragraph (b) by means of-

(1) A current rating of record; or

(2) A performance rating that covers a period of at least 90 days and is assigned in accordance with subpart B of part 430 of this chapter and the centralized review required by § 534.505(a)(5), but only if a rating of record is not available or does not reflect current performance.

(d) Any increase under this section that results in a rate of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule may not be made effective unless-

(1) The rating of record or performance rating used to justify the increase covers a period of at least 90 days of performance during which the applicable performance appraisal system has continuously been certified under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and part 430, subpart D of this chapter;

(2) The rating of record or performance rating used to justify the increase becomes final while the applicable performance appraisal system is certified;

(3) The rating and pay increase are reviewed and approved in accordance with § 534.505(a);

(4) The pay increase is approved in accordance with § 534.505(c), as applicable, and the agency's written procedures; and

(5) The pay increase becomes effective while the applicable performance appraisal system is certified.

(e) Upon the initial certification under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and part 430, subpart D of this chapter by OPM, with OMB concurrence, of an agency performance appraisal system covering SL or ST employees, OPM may waive the requirement of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The requirement may be waived only if OPM determines that the agency has, for a period of no less than 90 days prior to certification, consistently applied the same performance appraisal system to covered SL or ST employees in a manner consistent with certification. If OPM waives this requirement, OPM will notify the agency in writing.

(f) Except as required by paragraph (g) of this section, a pay increase under this section may not be provided to an employee-

(1) Who has a current rating of record below Level 3 (Fully Successful or equivalent), as described in § 430.208 of this chapter; or

(2) Who, after receiving a rating of record at Level 3 or above, receives a more recent performance rating that rates performance in a critical element at a level below Fully Successful, as described in § 430.206(b)(8)(i) of this chapter.

(g) An SL or ST employee whose rate of basic pay would otherwise fall below the minimum rate of the SL and ST pay range under § 534.504(a)(1) must be provided a pay adjustment sufficient to maintain the minimum rate of basic pay.

(h)(1) If the rates of basic pay under the General Schedule are increased under 5 U.S.C. 5303 on the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the agency head decides upon a zero adjustment for an SL or ST employee who has a current rating of record or applicable performance rating at Level 3 or above, as described in § 430.208 of this chapter, the agency must communicate the reasons for that decision to the employee in writing.

(2) Paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not apply to a senior professional with a rate of basic pay described in § 534.505(c)(1) unless-

(i) The rates of basic pay for the Executive Schedule are also increased on the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; and

(ii) The senior professional has a current rating of record or applicable performance rating at Level 4 in an appraisal program that uses summary level pattern C or G, or at Level 5 in an appraisal program that uses summary level pattern B, E, F, or H, as described in § 430.208 of this chapter.

(3) Paragraphs (h)(1) and (h)(2) of this section may not be construed to require a pay increase for any senior professional employee.
