###### § 875.201 Am I eligible as a Federal civilian or Postal employee?

(a) If you are a Federal civilian or Postal employee whose current position conveys eligibility for Federal Employees Health Benefits under part 890 of this chapter, you are also eligible to apply for coverage, with the following exceptions:

(1) If you are a District of Columbia employee or retiree, you are not eligible to apply for coverage, regardless of whether you are eligible for Federal Employees Health Benefits coverage. There is a related exception, however: D.C. government employees and retirees who were first employed by the D.C. government before October 1, 1987 are eligible to apply for coverage.

(2) If you are a Tennessee Valley Authority employee or retiree, you are eligible to apply for coverage, even though you may not be eligible for Federal Employees Health Benefits coverage.

(3) If you are a Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) employee or retiree you are eligible to apply when the Secretary of Defense determines such eligibility for the NAF instrumentality that employs you, and you will be treated the same as a Federal civilian employee or retiree (as applicable) under this Part.

(b) If you are a Federal civilian or Postal employee whose current position is excluded from Federal Employees Health Benefits eligibility under § 890.102 of this chapter, you are excluded from applying for coverage unless paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies.

(c) If you are an annuitant reemployed by the Federal Government, you may apply for coverage as an employee.
