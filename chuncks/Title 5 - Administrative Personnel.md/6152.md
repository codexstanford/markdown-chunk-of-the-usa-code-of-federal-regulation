###### § 849.202 Payment of annuity while finding a suitable representative payee.

(a) Annuity payments will be made directly to the annuitant or survivor annuitant while a suitable representative payee is located, unless the agency determines that direct payment would cause substantial harm to the individual.

(b) Substantial harm exists if both of the following conditions exist:

(1) Direct payment of benefits can be expected to cause serious physical or mental injury to the individual; and

(2) The potential effect of the injury outweighs the effect of having no income to meet the basic needs of the individual.

(c) If the agency determines that direct payment of benefits would cause substantial harm to the annuitant, annuity payments may be deferred (in the case of initial entitlement to benefits) or suspended (in the case of existing entitlement to benefits) until such time as a representative payee is appointed.

(d) Annuity payments will commence or resume as soon as practicable and will include all retroactive payments due to be paid.
