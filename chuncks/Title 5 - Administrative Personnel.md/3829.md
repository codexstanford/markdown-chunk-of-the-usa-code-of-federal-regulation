###### § 630.1016 Termination of a voluntary leave bank program.

(a) An agency may terminate a voluntary leave bank program only after it gives at least 30 calendar days advance written notice to current leave bank members.

(b) If an agency terminates a voluntary leave bank program before the termination of the medical emergency affecting a leave bank recipient, annual leave transferred to a leave bank recipient shall remain available for use under the rules set forth in subpart I of this part.

(c) An agency that terminates a voluntary leave bank program shall make provisions for the timely and equitable distribution of any leave remaining in the leave bank. The agency may allocate the leave to current leave recipients, recredit the leave to the accounts of the voluntary leave bank members, or a combination of both. The agency may distribute the leave immediately or may delay the distribution, in whole or part, until the beginning of the following leave year.
