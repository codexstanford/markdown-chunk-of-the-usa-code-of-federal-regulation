###### § 841.411 Appeals procedure for normal cost percentage.

(a) The normal cost percentages as published under § 841.407 are presumed to apply to all agencies. Any agency appealing application of a published normal cost percentage to any category of employees in its workforce must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board that the normal cost percentage for that category of employees in that agency is sufficiently different from the published normal cost percentage.

(b) While an agency has an appeal pending, the published normal cost percentage continues to apply to that agency.

(c) The Board cannot consider an appeal unless all the documents required for a petition for appeal under § 841.410(a) are filed before expiration of the time limit for an appeal.

(d) The Board cannot sustain an appeal unless the Board finds that-

(1) The data used in the agency's actuarial analysis are sufficient and reliable (As a general rule, at least 5 years of data pertaining to any group of employees must be analyzed before the results are considered sufficient and reliable.);

(2) The assumptions used in the agency's actuarial analysis are justified;

(3) When all relevant factors are considered together, there is a demonstrated difference between the published normal cost percentage being appealed and the normal cost percentage for the group at issue; and

(4) The difference is at least 10 percent of the published normal cost percentage being appealed.
