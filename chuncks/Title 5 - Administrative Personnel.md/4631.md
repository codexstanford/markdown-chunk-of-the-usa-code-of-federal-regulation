(d) For any amount of Federal wages paid after reaching the contribution and benefit base calculated including all wages, but before reaching the contribution and benefit base calculated using only Federal wages, the amount withheld under this section is the difference between 7, 7, or 8 percent, as appropriate, and the OASDI tax rate, even though the Federal wages in question are not subject to the OASDI tax.

(e) For any amount of Federal wages paid after reaching the contribution and benefit base calculated on the basis of Federal wages only, the full percentage required under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section (7, 7, or 8 percent) must be withheld from Federal wages.
