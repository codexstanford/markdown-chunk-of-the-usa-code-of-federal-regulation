(b) The amount of a supervisory differential shall not cause the supervisor's continuing pay, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, to exceed the continuing pay of the highest paid subordinate not under the General Schedule, as determined under paragraph (d) of this section, by more than 3 percent.

(c) For purposes of comparing the continuing pay of a supervisor whose position is under the General Schedule with the continuing pay of a subordinate whose position is not under the General Schedule, the following payments shall be included in determining the amount of continuing pay received by the supervisor:

(1) Basic pay, including a retained rate of pay under 5 U.S.C. 5363 and part 536 of this chapter or other similar authority:

(2) Any other continuing payment, except night, Sunday, or holiday premium pay or a hazardous duty differential under chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code;

(3) Premium pay paid on an annual basis under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c); and

(4) Any other continuing payment, except night, Sunday, or holiday premium pay or hazardous duty pay under 5 U.S.C. chapter 55, subchapter V; recruitment or relocation incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5753; retention incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5754; or similar payments under other legal authority.

(d) For purposes of comparing the continuing pay of a supervisor whose position is under the General Schedule with the continuing pay of a subordinate whose position is not under the General Schedule, the following payments shall be included in determining the amount of continuing pay received by the subordinate:

(1) Basic pay, excluding a night or environmental differential under 5 U.S.C. 5343(f) or 5343(c)(4), respectively, or similar payment under other legal authority;

(2) Any other continuing payment, except Sunday or holiday pay under 5 U.S.C. chapter 55, subchapter V; recruitment or relocation incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5753; retention incentives under 5 U.S.C. 5754; or similar payments under other legal authority; and

(3) Premium pay paid on an annual basis under an authority similar to 5 U.S.C. 5545(c).

(e) For the purpose of making any of the comparisons required by this subpart, continuing pay shall be calculated on an annual basis for both the supervisor and the subordinate.

(f) Payment of a supervisory differential is subject to the aggregate limitation on pay under 5 U.S.C. 5307 and subpart B of part 530 of this chapter.

(g) A supervisory differential shall not be considered part of the supervisor's rate of basic pay for any purpose.
