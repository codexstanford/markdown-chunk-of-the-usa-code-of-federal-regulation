###### § 591.104 Higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate.

(a) The head of an agency may establish one or more initial maximum uniform allowance rates greater than the Governmentwide maximum uniform allowance rate established under § 591.103.

(b) A higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate established under this section may not exceed the average total uniform cost for the minimum basic uniform for the affected employees and, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, applies only to the year in which the employee becomes subject to a requirement to wear the uniform.

(c) An agency that establishes one or more higher initial maximum uniform allowance rates under this section may divide the cost of the minimum basic uniform and continue a higher initial maximum uniform allowance for the year following the year the employee first becomes subject to the requirement to wear the uniform, provided the agency publishes a notice of its intention to continue such payments in thefor notice and comment.

(d) Before establishing a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate under this section, an agency shall publish in thefor notice and comment-

(1) A description and justification of the circumstances requiring a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate;

(2) An estimate of the number of employees affected;

(3) The specific items required for the basic uniform and the average total uniform cost for the affected employees;

(4) The amount of the proposed higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate to be paid during the year the employee first becomes subject to the uniform requirement;

(5) The proposed effective date of the higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate; and,

(6) The intent of the agency (if any) to divide the cost of a minimum basic uniform and continue to make higher initial maximum basic uniform allowance payments in the year following the year the employee first becomes subject to the uniform requirement.

(e) So that OPM can evaluate agencies' use of this authority and provide the Congress and others with information regarding the use of a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate, each agency concerned shall maintain such other records and submit to OPM such other reports and data as OPM shall require.

(f) When OPM determines that an agency is using this authority inappropriately, OPM may require its prior approval before that agency establishes any future higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate.

(g) An agency may increase a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate only as a result of an increase in the average total uniform cost for the affected employees. Before effecting an increase under this paragraph, an agency shall follow the notice and comment procedures required by paragraph (d) of this section.

(h) To establish a higher initial maximum uniform allowance rate applicable to the initial year a new style or type of minimum basic uniform is required for a category of employees, an agency shall use the higher initial maximum uniform allowance procedures provided under this section.
