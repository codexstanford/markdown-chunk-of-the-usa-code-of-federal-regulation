##### Subpart B - Grade Retention
###### § 536.202 Optional grade retention.

(a) Subject to the requirements in §§ 536.102 and 536.203, an authorized agency official may provide grade retention to an employee moving from a position under a covered pay system to a lower-graded position under a covered pay system when-

(1) Management announces a reorganization or reclassification decision in writing (including a general notice or a specific notice) that may or would affect the employee; and

(2) The employee moves to a lower-graded position (either at the employee's initiative or in response to a management-initiated offer) on or before the date the announced reorganization or reclassification is effected.

(b) An agency must apply § 536.105 in determining whether a position under a different covered pay system is a lower-graded position.

(c) When an employee is offered a position with grade retention under this section in anticipation of a reduction in grade, the agency must inform the employee in writing that acceptance of the position is not required and that declination of the offer will not affect the employee's entitlement to grade retention under § 536.201 if the agency actually moves the employee to the lower-graded position.
