####### § 839.1117 If I elect to change my retirement coverage under the FERCCA, can I get a refund of the service credit deposit I made and receive the actuarial reduction instead?

No, the FERCCA allows OPM to reduce an annuity by an actuarial reduction only for the deposit amount that remains unpaid.
