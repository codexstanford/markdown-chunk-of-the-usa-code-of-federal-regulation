####### § 838.724 Contesting the validity of court orders.

(a) An employee, retiree or person adversely affected by a court order who alleges that a court order is invalid must prove the invalidity of the court order by submitting to OPM a court order that-

(1) Declares invalid the court order submitted by the former spouse; or

(2) Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse.

(b) OPM must honor a court order acceptable for processing that appears to be valid and that the former spouse has certified is currently in force and has not been amended, superseded, or set aside, until the employee, separated employee, retiree, or person adversely affected by the court order submits to OPM a court order described in paragraph (a) of this section or, if issued before the retirement or death of the employee or separated employee, a court order acceptable for processing amending or superseding the court order submitted by the former spouse.
