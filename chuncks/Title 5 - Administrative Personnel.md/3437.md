###### § 581.203 Information minimally required to accompany legal process.

(a) Sufficient identifying information must accompany the legal process in order to enable processing by the governmental entity named. Therefore, the following identifying information about the obligor, if known, is requested:

(1) Full name;

(2) Date of birth;

(3) Employment number, social security number, Department of Veterans Affairs claim number, or civil service retirement claim number;

(4) Component of the governmental entity for which the obligor works, and the official duty station or worksite; and

(5) Status of the obligor, e.g., employee, former employee, or annuitant.

(b) If the information submitted is not sufficient to identify the obligor, the legal process shall be returned directly to the court, or other authority, with an explanation of the deficiency. However, prior to returning the legal process, if there is sufficient time, an attempt should be made to inform the party who caused the legal process to be served, or the party's representative, that it will not be honored unless adequate identifying information is supplied.
