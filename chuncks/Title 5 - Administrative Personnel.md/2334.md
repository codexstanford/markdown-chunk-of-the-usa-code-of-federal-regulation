###### § 532.254 Special schedules.

(a) A lead agency, with the approval of OPM, may establish special schedules for use within an area for specific occupations that are critical to the mission of a Federal activity based on findings that-

(1) Unusual prevailing pay practices exist in the private sector that are incompatible with regular schedule practices, and serious recruitment or retention problems exist or will likely develop if employees are paid from the authorized regular schedule; or

(2) Administrative considerations require the establishment of special schedules to address unique agency missions or other unusual circumstances that OPM considers appropriate.

(b) An OPM authorization for a special schedule shall include instructions for its construction, application, and administration.

(c) Unless otherwise specified, positions covered by special schedules shall be subject to the general provisions of this part and to other applicable rules and regulations of OPM.
