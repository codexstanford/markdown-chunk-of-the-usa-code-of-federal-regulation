The Director may, at his or her discretion, reopen and reconsider any decision when written argument or evidence is submitted which tends to establish that:

(a) The previous decision involves an erroneous interpretation of law or regulation, or a misapplication of established policy:

(b) The previous decision is of a precedential nature involving a new or unreviewed policy consideration that may have effects beyond the actual case at hand, or is otherwise of such an exceptional nature as to merit the personal attention of the Director.
