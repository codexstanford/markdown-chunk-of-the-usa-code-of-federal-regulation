##### Subpart I - Computing the Retirement Annuity for Employees Who Elect To Use NAFI Service To Qualify for an Immediate CSRS or FERS Retirement
###### § 847.910 If a retiree who elected to credit NAFI service for CSRS immediate retirement returns to work for the Government under conditions that terminate the annuity, how will the retirement annuity be computed when the employee's service with the Government ends?

(a) If an individual whose annuity terminates upon reemployment with the Government elects to credit NAFI service under subpart B of this part to qualify for a new immediate retirement when the reemployment ends, the annuity will be subject to a reduction under this subpart.

(b) If an individual whose annuity terminates upon reemployment with the Government qualifies for a new immediate retirement when the reemployment ends without crediting NAFI service, the new annuity will not be subject to a reduction under this subpart.

(c) If an individual whose annuity terminates upon reemployment with the Government qualifies for a deferred annuity when the reemployment ends, the deferred annuity will not be subject to a reduction under this subpart.

(d) The reduction in paragraph (a) of this section is computed in accordance with § 847.903 of this subpart as if the individual was retiring for the first time.
