(a) Sections 900.603-604 apply to those State and local governments that are required to operate merit personnel systems as a condition of eligibility for Federal assistance or participation in an intergovernmental program. Merit personnel systems are required for State and local personnel engaged in the administration of assistance and other intergovernmental programs, irrespective of the source of funds for their salaries, where Federal laws or regulations require the establishment and maintenance of such systems. A reasonable number of positions, however, may be exempted from merit personnel system coverage.

(b) Section 900.605 applies to Federal agencies that operate Federal assistance or intergovernmental programs.
