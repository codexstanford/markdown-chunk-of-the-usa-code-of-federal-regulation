###### § 930.107 Waiver of road test.

Under the following conditions, OPM or an agency head or his or her designated representative may waive the road test:

(a) OPM waives the road test requirement for operators of vehicles of one ton load capacity or less who possess a current driver's license from one of the 50 States, District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico, where the employee is domiciled or principally employed, except for operators of buses and vehicles used for: (1) Transportation of dangerous materials; (2) law enforcement; or (3) emergency services.

(b) OPM waives the road test for operators, and agencies may waive the road test for incidental operators of any class of vehicle, who possess a current driver's license for the specific type of vehicle to be operated from one of the 50 States, District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico, where the employee is domiciled or principally employed.

(c) An agency head may waive the road test for operators and incidental operators not covered by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, but only when in his or her opinion it is impractical to apply it, and then only for an employee whose competence as a driver has been established by his or her past driving record.
