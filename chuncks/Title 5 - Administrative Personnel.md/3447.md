###### § 581.306 Lack of moneys due from, or payable by, a governmental entity served with legal process; transfer of service of legal process to another governmental entity.

(a) When legal process is served on a governmental entity, and the individual identified in the legal process as the obligor is found not to be entitled to moneys (the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment) due from, or payable by, the governmental entity, the entity shall follow the procedures set forth in the legal process for that contingency or, if no procedures are set forth therein, shall return the legal process to the court, or other authority from which it was issued, and advise the court, or other authority, that no moneys, the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment, are due from, or payable by, the governmental entity to the named individual.

(b) Where it appears that remuneration for employment is only temporarily exhausted or otherwise unavailable, the court, or other authority, shall be fully advised as to why, and for how long, the remuneration will be unavailable, if that information is known by the governmental entity.

(c) In instances where an employee obligor separates from his/her employment with a governmental entity which is presently honoring a continuing legal process, the entity shall inform the party who caused the legal process to be served, or the party's representative, and the court, or other authority, that the payments are being discontinued. In cases where the obligor has a Thrift Savings Fund account, or has retired, or has separated and requested a refund of retirement contributions, or transferred, or is receiving benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, or where the employee obligor has been employed by either another governmental entity or by a private employer, and where this information is known by the governmental entity, the governmental entity shall provide the party with the designated agent for the new disbursing governmental entity or with the name and address of the private employer.

(d) In instances where an employee obligor, who is employed by a governmental entity which is honoring a continuing legal process, enters phased retirement status in accordance with part 831, subpart Q, and part 848 of this chapter, the entity must inform the party who caused the legal process to be served, or the party's representative, and the court or other authority, that remuneration for employment will continue at a reduced rate and that the employee obligor will be receiving a phased retirement annuity. The governmental entity must provide the party with the designated agent at the Office of Personnel Management who is responsible for the disbursement of retirement benefits.
