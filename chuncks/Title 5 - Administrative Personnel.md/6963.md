###### § 891.104 Responsibilities of retirement offices.

(a) The Office of Worker's Compensation Program is responsible only for retired employees who are receiving compensation from the Office and is responsible even though the retired employee has retired under another retirement office from which he/she is not currently receiving annuity. If the retired employee is currently receiving annuity from another retirement office, that retirement office, rather than the Office of Worker's Compensation Program, will have the responsibilities imposed on retirement offices by this part for that retired employee.

(b) Retirement offices are responsible, in accordance with regulations and instructions issued by OPM, for withholding from the annuity or compensation of each retired employee within the jurisdiction of the retirement office who elects to subscribe to the uniform plan his/her share of the cost, for forwarding the amount withheld to the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund, and for reporting to OPM amounts required for Government contribution for these retired employees.

(c) Retirement offices are responsible, in accordance with regulations and instructions issued by OPM, for reporting to OPM amounts required for Government contributions to retired employees within the jurisdiction of the retirement office who have elected to receive a Government contribution toward the cost of a private health benefits plan, and for paying the Government contributions to these retired employees.

(d) Retirement offices are responsible for advising retired employees within the jurisdiction of the retirement office of the rights and obligations of retired employees under this part.

(e) When one or more of the family members is a child 19 years of age or older who is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability which existed before the child became 19 years of age, the appropriate retirement office shall obtain the necessary evidence and make a determination of incapacity.

(f) Retirement offices are responsible, in accordance with regulations and instructions issued by OPM, for verifying continuing eligibility of retired employees to receive Government contributions.
