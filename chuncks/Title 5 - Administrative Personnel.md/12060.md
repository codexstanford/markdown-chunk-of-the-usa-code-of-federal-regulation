(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, providing services, other than clerical services or service as a fact witness, on behalf of any other person in connection with a particular matter:

(i) In which the United States is a party;

(ii) Engaging in teaching, speaking, consulting, or writing that relates to the employee's official duties.

(b) Unless the services are to be provided for compensation, including reimbursement for transportation, lodging and meals:

(1) Prior approval is not required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section to provide services as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise to represent, another Department of Education employee who is the subject of disciplinary, loyalty, or other personnel administration proceedings in connection with those proceedings; and

(2) Prior approval is not required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section:

(i) To participate in the activities of a:

(A) Social, fraternal, civic, or political entity;

(B) Religious entity that is not a prohibited source; or

(C) Parent-Teacher Association or similar parent organization at the employee's child's school or day care center, other than as a member of a board of directors or other governing body of the school or center, or the educational agency of which it is a part; or

(ii) To provide direct instructional, social, or medical services to students or other individuals.

(c) An employee who is required by paragraph (a) of this section to obtain prior written approval shall submit a written request for approval in accordance with Department procedures.

(d) The cognizant reviewing official shall grant approval unless he or she determines that the outside activity is expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635.
