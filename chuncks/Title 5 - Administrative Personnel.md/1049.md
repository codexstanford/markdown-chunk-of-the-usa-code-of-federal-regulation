###### § 317.402 Career reserved positions.

(a) The qualifications standard must be in writing and identify the breadth and depth of the professional/technical and executive/managerial knowledges, skills, and abilities, or other qualifications, required for successful performance in the position.

(b) The standard must be specific enough to enable applicants to be rated and ranked according to their degree of qualifications when the position is being filled on a competitive basis.

(c) Each qualifications criterion in the standard must be job related. The standard may not emphasize agency-related experience, however, to the extent that it precludes otherwise well-qualified candidates from outside the agency from appointment consideration.

(d) The standard may not include-

(1) A minimum length of experience requirement beyond that authorized for similar positions in the General Schedule;

(2) A minimum education requirement beyond that authorized for similar positions in the General Schedule; or

(3) Any criterion prohibited by law or regulation.
