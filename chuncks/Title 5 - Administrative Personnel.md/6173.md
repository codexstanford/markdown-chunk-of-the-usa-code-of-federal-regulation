###### § 849.601 When a new representative payee will be selected.

(a) When the agency learns that the interests of the annuitant are not served by continuing payment to the present representative payee or that the present representative payee is no longer able or willing to carry out the payee responsibilities, the agency will undertake to find a new representative payee.

(b) The agency will select a new representative payee if the agency finds a preferred payee or if the present payee:

(1) Has been found by the agency or a court of competent jurisdiction to have misused the benefits;

(2) Has not used the benefit payments on the annuitant's behalf in accordance with the rules in this part;

(3) Has not carried out the other responsibilities described in this subpart;

(4) Dies;

(5) No longer wishes to be the representative payee;

(6) Is unable to manage the benefit payments; or

(7) Fails to cooperate, within a reasonable time, in providing evidence, accounting, or other information requested by the agency.

(c) The agency may suspend payment as explained in § 849.202(c) if we determine that making direct payment to the annuitant would cause substantial harm. Payments, including all retroactive amounts due, will resume once a representative payee is located.
