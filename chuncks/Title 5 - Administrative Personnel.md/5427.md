(a) Military reserve technicians who retire as a result of a medical disability are excepted from the bar against COLA increases for retirees under age 62.

(b) Military reserve technicians have retired as a result of a medical disability if they retire under-

(1) Section 8451(a)(1)(B) of title 5, United States Code (allowing retirement by military reserve technicians who are medically disabled for their positions); or

(2) Section 8456 of title 5, United States Code (allowing retirement by military reserve technicians who are not disabled for their positions and who are not eligible under the special military technician discontinued service provisions (section 8414(c)) but who are medically disqualified for military service or the rank required to hold their positions).

(c)(1) Military reserve technicians have not retired as a result of a medical disability if they retire under section 8414(c) of title 5, United States Code (allowing retirement by military reserve technicians who may not be disabled for their positions, but are medically or nonmedically disqualified for military service or the rank required to hold the position, and who are at least age 50 with 25 years of service), unless they provide OPM official documentation showing that their disqualification was for medical reasons.

OPM will inform these retirees that they will not receive COLA's until they reach age 62 unless they provide an official certification from the military showing that their disqualification was for medical reasons.
