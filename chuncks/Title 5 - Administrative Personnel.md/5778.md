(b) An annuity under this subpart terminates on the last day of the month before the child-

(1) Becomes 18 years of age unless he or she is a student as described in § 843.410 or is incapable of self-support;

(2) Becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless he or she is a student as described in § 843.410;

(c) A survivor annuity accrues on a daily basis, one-thirtieth of the monthly rate constituting the daily rate. An annuity does not accrue for the 31st day of any month, except in the initial month if the survivor's (of a deceased employee) annuity commences on the 31st day. For accrual purposes, the last day of a 28-day month constitutes 3 days and the last day of a 29-day month constitutes 2 days.
