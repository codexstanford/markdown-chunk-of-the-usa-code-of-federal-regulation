###### Elections at the Time of Retirement
####### § 831.612 Election at time of retirement of a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity.

(a) An unmarried employee or Member retiring under CSRS may elect a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity or annuities.

(b) A married employee or Member retiring under CSRS may elect a fully reduced annuity or a partially reduced annuity to provide a former spouse annuity or annuities instead of a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, if the current spouse consents to the election in accordance with § 831.614 or spousal consent is waived in accordance with § 831.618.

(c) An election under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is void to the extent that it-

(1) Conflicts with a qualifying court order; or

(2) Would cause the total of current spouse annuities and former spouse annuities payable based on the employee's or Member's service to exceed 55 percent (or 50 percent if based on a separation before October 11, 1962) of the self-only annuity to which the employee or Member would be entitled.

(d) Any reduction in an annuity to provide a former spouse annuity will terminate on the first day of the month after the former spouse remarries before age 55 or dies, or the former spouse's eligibility for a former spouse annuity terminates under the terms of a qualifying court order, unless-

(1) The retiree elects, within 2 years after the former spouse's death or remarriage, to continue the reduction to provide or increase a former spouse annuity for another former spouse, or to provide or increase a current spouse annuity; or

(2) A qualifying court order requires the retiree to provide another former spouse annuity.

(e) The maximum rate of a former spouse annuity under this section or § 831.632 is 55 percent of the rate of the retiring employee's or Member's self-only annuity if the employee or Member is retiring based on a separation from a position under CSRS on or after October 11, 1962. The maximum rate of a former spouse annuity under this section or § 831.632 is 50 percent of the rate of the retiring employee's or Member's self-only annuity if the employee or Member is retiring based on a separation from a position covered under CSRS between September 30, 1956, and October 11, 1962.

(f)(1) The amount of the reduction to provide one or more former spouse annuities or a combination of a current spouse annuity and one or more former spouse annuities under this section equals 2percent of the first $3600 of the total designated survivor base plus 10 percent of the portion of the total designated survivor base which exceeds $3600, if-

(i) The employee's or Member's separation on which the retirement is based was on or after October 11, 1962; or

(ii) The reduction is to provide a former spouse annuity (under § 831.632) for a former spouse from whom the employee or Member was divorced after retirement.

(2) The amount of the reduction to provide one or more former spouse annuities or a combination of a current spouse annuity and one or more former spouse annuities under this section for employees or Members whose retirement is based on separations before October 11, 1962, equals 2percent of the first $2400 of the total designated survivor base plus 10 percent of the portion of the total designated survivor base which exceeds $2400.
