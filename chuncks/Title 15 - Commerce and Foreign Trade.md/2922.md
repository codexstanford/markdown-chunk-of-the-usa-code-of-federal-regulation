##### PART 715 - ACTIVITIES INVOLVING UNSCHEDULED DISCRETE ORGANIC CHEMICALS (UDOCs)
###### Supplement No. 2 to Part 715 - Examples of Unscheduled Discrete Organic Chemicals (UDOCs) and UDOC Production

(1) Examples of UDOCs not subject to declaration include:

(i) UDOCs produced coincidentally as by-products that are not isolated for use or sale as a specific end product, and are routed to, or escape from, the waste stream of a stack, incinerator, or waste treatment system or any other waste stream;

(ii) UDOCs, contained in mixtures, which are produced coincidentally and not isolated for use or sale as a specific end-product;

(iii) UDOCs produced by recycling (i.e., involving one of the processes listed in paragraph (3) of this supplement) of previously declared UDOCs;

(iv) UDOCs produced by the mixing (i.e., the process of combining or blending into one mass) of previously declared UDOCs; and

(v) UDOCs that are intermediates and that are used in a single or multi-step process to produce another declared UDOC.

(2) Examples of UDOCs that you must declare under part 715 of the CWCR include, but are not limited to, the following, unless they are not isolated for use or sale as a specific end product:

(i) Acetophenone (CAS #98-86-2);

(ii) 6-Chloro-2-methyl aniline (CAS #87-63-8);

(iii) 2-Amino-3-hydroxybenzoic acid (CAS #548-93-6); and

(iv) Acetone (CAS #67-64-1).

(3) Examples of activities that are not considered "production by synthesis" under part 715 of the CWCR, which means the end products resulting from such activities would not be declared under part 715, are as follows:

(i) Fermentation;

(ii) Extraction;

(iii) Purification;

(iv) Distillation; and

(v) Filtration.
