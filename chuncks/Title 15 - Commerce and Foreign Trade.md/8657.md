##### § 2007.0 Requests for reviews.

(a) An interested party may submit a request (1) that additional articles be designated as eligible for GSP duty-free treatment, provided that the article has not been accepted for review within the three preceding calendar years; or (2) that the duty-free treatment accorded to eligible articles under the GSP be withdrawn, suspended or limited; or (3) for a determination of whether a like or directly competitive product was produced in the United States on January 3, 1985 for the purposes of section 504(d)(1) (19 U.S. 2464(d)(1)); or (4) that the President exercise his waiver authority with respect to a specific article or articles pursuant to section 504(c)(3) (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(3)); or (5) that product coverage be otherwise modified.

(b) During the annual reviews and general reviews conducted pursuant to the schedule set out in § 2007.3 any person may file a request to have the GSP status of any eligible beneficiary developing country reviewed with respect to any of the designation criteria listed in section 502(b) or 502(c) (19 U.S.C. 2642 (b) and (c)). Such requests must (1) specify the name of the person or the group requesting the review; (2) identify the beneficiary country that would be subject to the review; (3) indicate the specific section 502(b) or 502(c) criteria which the requestor believes warrants review; (4) provide a statement of reasons why the beneficiary country's status should be reviewed along with all available supporting information; (5) supply any other relevant information as requested by the GSP Subcommittee. If the subject matter of the request has been reviewed pursuant to a previous request, the request must include substantial new information warranting further consideration of the issue.

(c) An interested party or any other person may make submissions supporting, opposing or otherwise commenting on a request submitted pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
