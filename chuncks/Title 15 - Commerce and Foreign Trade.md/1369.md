###### § 30.26 Reporting of vessels, aircraft, cargo vans, and other carriers and containers.

(a) Export information shall be filed in the AES for all vessels, locomotives, aircraft, rail cars, trucks, other vehicles, trailers, pallets, cargo vans, lift vans, or similar shipping containers when these items are moving as goods pursuant to sale or other transfer from ownership in the United States to ownership abroad. If the vessel, car, aircraft, locomotive, rail car, vehicle, or shipping container is outside Customs territory of the United States at the time of sale or transfer to foreign ownership, EEI shall be reported identifying the last port of clearance or departure from the United States prior to sale or transfer. The date of export shall be the date of sale.

(b) The country of destination to be shown in the EEI for vessels sold foreign is the country of new ownership. The country for which the vessel clears, or the country of registry of the vessel, should not be reported as the country of destination in the EEI unless such country is the country of new ownership.
