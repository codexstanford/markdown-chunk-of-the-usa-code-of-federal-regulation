The five zones and access routes are:

(1) The 0.96 miarea off Pillar Point Harbor from harbor launch ramps, through the harbor entrance to the northern boundary of Zone One. The boundary for Zone 1 begins at Point 1 in the coordinate table listed below and continues to each subsequent point in numerical order ending at Point 6.

(2) The 2.63 miarea off of Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor from harbor launch ramps, through the harbor entrance, and then along a 100-yard wide access route to the south-southwest along a bearing of approximately 196&#xB0; true (183&#xB0; magnetic) toward the red and white whistle buoy at 36.93899 N, 122.009612 W, until crossing between the two yellow can buoys marking, respectively, the northeast and northwest corners of the zone. The boundary for Zone 2 begins at Point 1 in the coordinate table listed below and continues to each subsequent point in numerical order ending at Point 5.

(3) The 2.29 miarea off of Moss Landing Harbor from harbor launch ramps, through harbor entrance, and then along a 100-yard wide access route southwest along a bearing of approximately 230&#xB0; true (217&#xB0; magnetic) to the red and white bell buoy at 36.79893 N, 121.80157 W. The boundary for Zone 3 begins at Point 1 in the coordinate table listed below and continues to each subsequent point in numerical order ending at Point 5.

(4) The 3.10 miarea off of Monterey Harbor from harbor launch ramps to a point midway between the seaward end of the U.S. Coast Guard Pier and the seaward end of Wharf 2, and then along a 100-yard wide access route to the northeast along a bearing of approximately 67&#xB0; true (54&#xB0; magnetic) to the yellow can buoy marking the southeast corner of the zone. The boundary for Zone 4 begins at Point 1 in the coordinate table listed below and continues to each subsequent point in numerical order ending at Point 6.

(5) The 0.13 miarea near Pillar Point from the Pillar Point Harbor entrance along a 100-yard wide access route to the south along a bearing of approximately 174&#xB0; true (161&#xB0; magnetic) to the green bell buoy (identified as "Buoy 3") at 37.48154 N, 122.48156 W and then along a 100-yard wide access route northwest along a bearing of approximately 284&#xB0; true (271&#xB0; magnetic) to the green gong buoy (identified as "Buoy 1") at 37.48625 N, 122.50603 W, the southwest boundary of Zone Five. Zone Five exists only when a High Surf Advisory has been issued by the National Weather Service and is in effect for San Mateo County and only during December, January, and February. The boundary for Zone 5 begins at Point 1 in the coordinate table listed below and continues to each subsequent point in numerical order ending at Point 5.
