###### Supplement No. 7 to Part 742 - Description of Major Weapons Systems

(1) Battle Tanks: Tracked or wheeled self-propelled armored fighting vehicles with high cross-country mobility and a high-level of self protection, weighing at least 16.5 metric tons unladen weight, with a high muzzle velocity direct fire main gun of at least 75 millimeters caliber.

(2) Armored Combat Vehicles: Tracked, semi-tracked, or wheeled self-propelled vehicles, with armored protection and cross-country capability, either designed and equipped to transport a squad of four or more infantrymen, or armed with an integral or organic weapon of a least 12.5 millimeters caliber or a missile launcher.

(3) Large-Caliber Artillery Systems: Guns, howitzers, artillery pieces combining the characteristics of a gun or a howitzer, mortars or multiple-launch rocket systems, capable of engaging surface targets by delivering primarily indirect fire, with a caliber of 75 millimeters and above.

(4) Combat Aircraft: Fixed-wing or variable-geometry wing aircraft designed, equipped, or modified to engage targets by employing guided missiles, unguided rockets, bombs, guns, cannons, or other weapons of destruction, including versions of these aircraft which perform specialized electronic warfare, suppression of air defense or reconnaissance missions. The term "combat aircraft" does not include primary trainer aircraft, unless designed, equipped, or modified as described above.

(5) Attack Helicopters: Rotary-wing aircraft designed, equipped or modified to engage targets by employing guided or unguided anti-armor, air-to-surface, air-to-subsurface, or air-to-air weapons and equipped with an integrated fire control and aiming system for these weapons, including versions of these aircraft that perform specialized reconnaissance or electronic warfare missions.

(6) Warships: Vessels or submarines armed and equipped for military use with a standard displacement of 750 metric tons or above, and those with a standard displacement of less than 750 metric tons that are equipped for launching missiles with a range of at least 25 kilometers or torpedoes with a similar range.

(7) Missiles and Missile Launchers:

(a) Guided or unguided rockets, or ballistic, or cruise missiles capable of delivering a warhead or weapon of destruction to a range of at least 25 kilometers, and those items that are designed or modified specifically for launching such missiles or rockets, if not covered by systems identified in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this Supplement. For purposes of this rule, systems in this paragraph include remotely piloted vehicles with the characteristics for missiles as defined in this paragraph but do not include ground-to-air missiles;

(b) Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems (MANPADS); or

(c) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) of any type, including sensors for guidance and control of these systems, except model airplanes.

(8) Offensive Space Weapons: Systems or capabilities that can deny freedom of action in space for the United States and its allies or hinder the United States and its allies from denying an adversary the ability to take action in space. This includes systems such as anti-satellite missiles, or other systems designed to defeat or destroy assets in space.

(9) Command, Control, Communications, Computer, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR): Systems that support military commanders in the exercise of authority and direction over assigned forces across the range of military operations; collect, process, integrate, analyze, evaluate, or interpret information concerning foreign countries or areas; systematically observe aerospace, surface or subsurface areas, places, persons, or things by visual, aural, electronic, photographic, or other means; and obtain, by visual observation or other detection methods, information about the activities and resources of an enemy or potential enemy, or secure data concerning the meteorological, hydrographic, or geographic characteristics of a particular area, including Undersea communications. Also includes sensor technologies.

(10) Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs), including "smart bombs": Weapons used in precision bombing missions such as specially designed weapons, or bombs fitted with kits to allow them to be guided to their target.

(11) Night vision equipment: Any electro-optical device that is used to detect visible and infrared energy and to provide an image. This includes night vision goggles, forward-looking infrared systems, thermal sights, and low-light level systems that are night vision devices, as well as infrared focal plane array detectors and cameras specifically designed, developed, modified, or configured for military use; image intensification and other night sighting equipment or systems specifically designed, modified or configured for military use; second generation and above military image intensification tubes specifically designed, developed, modified, or configured for military use, and infrared, visible and ultraviolet devices specifically designed, developed, modified, or configured for military application.
