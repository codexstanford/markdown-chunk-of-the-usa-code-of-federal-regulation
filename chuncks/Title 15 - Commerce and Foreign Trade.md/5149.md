####### Accessories.

These are associated items for any "component," "end item," or "system," and which are not necessary for their operation, but which enhance their usefulness or effectiveness. For example, for a riding lawnmower, "accessories" and "attachments" will include the bag to capture the cut grass, and a canopy to protect the operator from the sun and rain. For purposes of this definition, "accessories" and "attachments" are the same.
