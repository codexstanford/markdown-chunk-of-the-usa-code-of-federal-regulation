The RCOS shall review and update the Build-out Plan at least once every five years; and

(3) Document the priority regional gaps in observation coverage needs, as determined by an analysis of the RICE asset inventory and Build-out Plan. The RCOS shall review and update the analysis of priority regional gaps in observation coverage needs at least once every five years.
