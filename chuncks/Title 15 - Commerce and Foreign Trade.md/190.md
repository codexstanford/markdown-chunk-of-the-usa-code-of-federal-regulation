### PART 5 - OPERATION OF VENDING STANDS
#### § 5.2 Policy.

(a) The Department adopts the Federal policy announced in the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act, as amended, to provide blind persons with remunerative employment to enlarge the economic opportunities of the blind and to stimulate the blind to greater efforts in striving to make themselves self-supporting.

(b) It shall be the policy of the Department to authorize blind persons licensed under the provisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act, as amended to operate vending stands without any charge for space or necessary utilities on properties owned and occupied by the Department or on which the Department controls maintenance, operation, and protection.

(c) The Department will cooperate with the Department of Education and State licensing agencies in making surveys to determine whether and where vending stands may be properly and profitably operated by licensed blind persons.

(d) The application of a State licensing agency for a permit may be denied or revoked if it is determined that the interests of the United States would be adversely affected or the Department would be unduly inconvenienced by the issuance of a permit or its continuance.

(e) Disagreements concerning the denial, revocation, or modification of a permit may be appealed by the State licensing agency as set forth in § 5.6.
