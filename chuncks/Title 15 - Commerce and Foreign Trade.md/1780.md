###### § 285.12 Monitoring visits.

(a) In addition to regularly scheduled assessments, monitoring visits may be conducted by NVLAP at any time during the accreditation period. They may occur for cause or on a random selection basis. While most monitoring visits will be scheduled in advance with the laboratory, NVLAP may conduct unannounced monitoring visits.

(b) The scope of a monitoring visit may range from checking a few designated items to a complete review. The assessors may review nonconformity resolutions, verify reported changes in the laboratory's personnel, facilities or operations, or evaluate proficiency testing activities, when appropriate.
