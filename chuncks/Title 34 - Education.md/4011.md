(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, any Federal funds, including reallotted funds, that are appropriated for a fiscal year to carry out a program under this part that are not obligated or expended by the DSA prior to the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year, and any program income received during a fiscal year that is not obligated or expended by the DSA prior to the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year in which the program income was received, remain available for obligation and expenditure by the DSA during that succeeding fiscal year.

(b) Federal funds appropriated for a fiscal year under this part remain available for obligation in the succeeding fiscal year only to the extent that the DSA complied with its matching requirement by obligating, in accordance with 34 CFR 76.707, the non-Federal share in the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated.

(c) Program income is considered earned in the fiscal year in which it is received. Program income earned during the fiscal year must be disbursed during the time in which new obligations may be incurred to carry out the work authorized under the award, and prior to requesting additional cash payments.
