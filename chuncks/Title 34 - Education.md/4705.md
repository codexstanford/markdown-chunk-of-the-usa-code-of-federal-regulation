###### § 600.41 Termination and emergency action proceedings.

(a) If the Secretary believes that a previously designated eligible institution as a whole, or at one or more of its locations, does not satisfy the statutory or regulatory requirements that define that institution as an eligible institution, the Secretary may-

(1) Terminate the institution's eligibility designation in whole or as to a particular location-

(i) Under the procedural provisions applicable to terminations contained in 34 CFR 668.81, 668.83, 668.86, 668.87, 668.88, 668.89, 668.90 (a)(1), (a)(4), and (c) through (f), and 668.91; or

(ii) Under a show-cause hearing, if the institution's loss of eligibility results from-

(A) Its previously qualifying as an eligible vocational school;

(B) Its loss of accreditation or preaccreditation;

(C) Its loss of legal authority to provide postsecondary education in the State in which it is physically located;

(D) Its violations of the provisions contained in § 600.5(a)(8) or § 600.7(a);

(E) Its permanently closing; or

(F) Its ceasing to provide educational programs for a reason other than a normal vacation period or a natural disaster that directly affects the institution, a particular location, or the students of the institution or location;

(2) Limit, under the provisions of 34 CFR 668.86, the authority of the institution to disburse, deliver, or cause the disbursement or delivery of funds under one or more title IV, HEA programs as otherwise provided under 34 CFR 668.26 for the benefit of students enrolled at the ineligible institution or location prior to the loss of eligibility of that institution or location; and

(3) Initiate an emergency action under the provisions contained in 34 CFR 668.83 with regard to the institution's participation in one or more title IV, HEA programs.

(b) If the Secretary believes that an educational program offered by an institution that was previously designated by the Secretary as an eligible institution under the HEA does not satisfy relevant statutory or regulatory requirements that define that educational program as part of an eligible institution, the Secretary may in accordance with the procedural provisions described in paragraph (a) of this section-

(1) Undertake to terminate that educational program's eligibility under one or more of the title IV, HEA programs under the procedural provisions applicable to terminations described in paragraph (a) of this section;

(2) Limit the institution's authority to deliver, disburse, or cause the delivery or disbursement of funds provided under that title IV, HEA program to students enrolled in that educational program, as otherwise provided in 34 CFR 668.26; and

(3) Initiate an emergency action under the provisions contained in 34 CFR 668.83 with regard to the institution's participation in one or more title IV, HEA programs with respect to students enrolled in that educational program.

(c)(1) An action to terminate and limit the eligibility of an institution as a whole or as to any of its locations or educational programs is initiated in accordance with 34 CFR 668.86(b) and becomes final 20 days after the Secretary notifies the institution of the proposed action, unless the designated department official receives by that date a request for a hearing or written material that demonstrates that the termination and limitation should not take place.

(2) Once a termination under this section becomes final, the termination is effective with respect to any commitment, delivery, or disbursement of funds provided under an applicable title IV, HEA program by the institution-

(i) Made to students enrolled in the ineligible institution, location, or educational program; and

(ii) Made on or after the date of the act or omission that caused the loss of eligibility as to the institution, location, or educational program.

(3) Once a limitation under this section becomes final, the limitation is effective with regard to any commitment, delivery, or disbursement of funds under the applicable title IV, HEA program by the institution-

(i) Made after the date on which the limitation became final; and

(ii) Made to students enrolled in the ineligible institution, location, or educational program.

(d) After a termination under this section of the eligibility of an institution as a whole or as to a location or educational program becomes final, the institution may not originate applications for, make awards of or commitments for, deliver, or disburse funds under the applicable title IV, HEA program, except-

(1) In accordance with the requirements of 34 CFR 668.26(c) with respect to students enrolled in the ineligible institution, location, or educational program; and

(2) After satisfaction of any additional requirements, imposed pursuant to a limitation under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, which may include the following:

(i) Completion of the actions required by 34 CFR 668.26(a) and (b).

(ii) Demonstration that the institution has made satisfactory arrangements for the completion of actions required by 34 CFR 668.26(a) and (b).

(iii) Securing the confirmation of a third party selected by the Secretary that the proposed disbursements or delivery of title IV, HEA program funds meet the requirements of the applicable program.

(iv) Using institutional funds to make disbursements permitted under this paragraph and seeking reimbursement from the Secretary for those disbursements.

(e) If the Secretary undertakes to terminate the eligibility of an institution, location, or program under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

(1) If the basis for the loss of eligibility is the loss of accreditation or preaccreditation, the sole issue is whether the institution, location, or program has the requisite accreditation or preaccreditation. The presiding official has no authority to consider challenges to the action of the accrediting agency.

(2) If the basis for the loss of eligibility is the loss of legal authorization, the sole issue is whether the institution, location, or program has the requisite legal authorization. The presiding official has no authority to consider challenges to the action of a State agency in removing the legal authorization.

(3) If the basis for the loss of eligibility of a foreign graduate medical school is one or more annual pass rates on the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination below the threshold required in § 600.55(f)(1)(ii), the sole issue is whether one or more of the foreign medical school's pass rate or rates for the preceding calendar year fell below that threshold. For a foreign graduate medical school that opted to have the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) calculate and provide the pass rates directly to the Secretary for the preceding calendar year as permitted under § 600.55(d)(2) in lieu of the foreign graduate medical school providing pass rate data to the Secretary under § 600.55(d)(1)(iii), the ECFMG's calculations of the school's rates are conclusive; and the presiding official has no authority to consider challenges to the computation of the rate or rates by the ECFMG.
