(b) An LEA may use modernization grant funds received under this program only to renovate, alter, retrofit, extend, and, in the limited circumstances described in paragraph (c) of this section, replace a public elementary or secondary school facility used for free public education to provide school facilities that support a contemporary educational program for the LEA's students at normal capacity, and in accordance with the laws, standards, or common practices in the LEA's State.

(c)(1) An emergency or modernization grant under this program may be used for the construction of a new school facility but only if the Secretary determines-

(ii) In consultation with the grantee, that partial or complete replacement of the facility would be less expensive or more cost-effective than improving the existing facility.

(i) Construction of instructional, resource, food service, and general or administrative support areas, so long as they are a part of the instructional facility; and

(ii) Purchase of initial equipment or machinery, and initial utility connections.
