The Secretary may give an absolute preference to any of the academic areas listed as disciplines or subdisciplines below, or the resulting inter-disciplines. The list was derived from the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) developed by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement of the U.S. Department of Education and includes the instructional programs that may constitute courses of studies toward graduate degrees. The code number to the left of each discipline and subdiscipline is the Department's identification code for that particular type of instructional program.
