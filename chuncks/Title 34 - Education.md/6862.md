###### § 675.25 Earnings applied to cost of attendance.

(a)(1) The institution shall determine the amount of earnings from a FWS job to be applied to a student's cost of attendance (attributed earnings) by subtracting taxes and job related costs from the student's gross earnings.

(2) Job related costs are costs the student incurs because of his or her job. Examples are uniforms and transportation to and from work. Room and board during a vacation period may also be considered a job related cost if they would not otherwise be incurred except for the FWS employment.

(b) If a student is employed under FWS during a vacation or other period when he or she is not attending classes, the institution shall apply the attributed earnings (earnings minus taxes and job related costs) to the cost of attendance for the next period of enrollment.
