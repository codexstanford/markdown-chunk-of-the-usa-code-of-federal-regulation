(3) An individual who has a high risk for academic failure.

(c) Has a need for academic support, as determined by the grantee, in order to pursue successfully a program of education beyond high school.

(d) At the time of initial selection, has completed the eighth grade and is at least 13 years old but not older than 19, although the Secretary may waive the age requirement if the applicant demonstrates that the limitation would defeat the purposes of the Upward Bound program.
