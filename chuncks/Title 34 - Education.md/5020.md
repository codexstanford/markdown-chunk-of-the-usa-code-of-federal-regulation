###### § 609.31 How does the Secretary determine the amount of a grant?

Of the amount appropriated for any fiscal year-

(a)(1) The first $12,000,000 (or any lesser amount appropriated) shall be available only for the purpose of making grants to institutions or programs described in § 609.2(b)(1) through § 609.2(b)(5);

(2) If the sum of the approved applications does not exceed the amount appropriated, the Secretary awards grants in the amounts requested and approved;

(3) If the sum of the approved requests exceeds the sum appropriated, and Morehouse School of Medicine submits an approved request for at least $3,000,000, and the amount appropriated exceeds $3,000,000, the Secretary awards no less than $3,000,000 to Morehouse School of Medicine and reduces the grants to the institutions described in § 609.2(b)(1) through § 609.2(b)(5) as the Secretary considers appropriate, so that the sum of the approved grants equals the amount appropriated; and

(4) If Morehouse School of Medicine submits an approved request for at least $3,000,000 and the amount appropriated does not exceed $3,000,000, Morehouse School of Medicine receives all the appropriated funds; and

(b)(1) Any amount appropriated in excess of $12,000,000 shall be available for the purpose of making grants, in equal amounts not to exceed $500,000, to institutions or programs described in § 609.2(b)(6) through § 609.2(b)(16); and

(2) If any funds remain, the Secretary makes grants to institutions or programs described in § 609.2(b)(1) through § 609.2(b)(16).
