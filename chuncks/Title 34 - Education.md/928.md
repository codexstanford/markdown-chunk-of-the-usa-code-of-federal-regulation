(i) Serving only eligible beneficiaries.

(ii) Providing only authorized services or benefits.

(iii) Complying with expenditure requirements and conditions, such as set-aside, excess cost, maintenance of effort, comparability, supplement-not-supplant, and matching requirements.

(iv) Preserving the integrity of planning, application, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.

(v) Maintaining accountability for the use of funds.
