###### § 645.13 How are regular Upward Bound projects organized?

(a) Regular Upward Bound projects-

(1) Must provide participants with a summer instructional component that is designed to simulate a college-going experience for participants, and an academic year component; and

(2) May provide a summer bridge component to those Upward Bound participants who have graduated from secondary school and intend to enroll in an institution of higher education in the following fall term. A summer bridge component provides participants with services and activities, including college courses, that aid in the transition from secondary education to postsecondary education.

(b) A summer instructional component shall-

(1) Be six weeks in length unless the grantee can demonstrate to the Secretary that a shorter period will not hinder the effectiveness of the project nor prevent the project from achieving its goals and objectives, and the Secretary approves that shorter period; and

(2) Provide participants with one or more of the services described in § 645.11 at least five days per week.

(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an academic year component shall provide program participants with one or more of the services described in § 645.11 on a weekly basis throughout the academic year and, to the extent possible, shall not prevent participants from fully participating in academic and nonacademic activities at the participants' secondary school.

(2) If an Upward Bound project's location or the project's staff are not readily accessible to participants because of distance or lack of transportation, the grantee may, with the Secretary's permission, provide project services to participants every two weeks during the academic year.
