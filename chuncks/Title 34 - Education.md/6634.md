###### § 674.9 Student eligibility.

Prior to October 1, 2017, a student at an institution of higher education was eligible to receive a loan under the Federal Perkins Loan program for an award year if the student-

(a) Meets the relevant eligibility requirements contained in 34 CFR part 668;

(b) Is enrolled or accepted for enrollment as an undergraduate, graduate, or professional student at the institution, whether or not engaged in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the home institution;

(c) Has financial need as determined in accordance with part F of title IV of the HEA.

(d) Has received for that award year, if an undergraduate student-

(1) A SAR as a result of applying for a grant under the Federal Pell Grant Program; or

(2) A preliminary determination of eligibility or ineligibility for a Federal Pell Grant by the institution's financial aid administrator after applying for a SAR with a Federal Pell Grant Processor;

(e) Is willing to repay the loan. Failure to meet payment obligations on a previous loan is evidence that the student is unwilling to repay the loan;

(f) Provides to the institution a driver's license number, if any, at the time of application for the loan;

(g) In the case of a borrower whose prior loan under title IV of the Act or whose TEACH Grant service obligation was discharged after a final determination of total and permanent disability-

(1) Obtains a certification from a physician that the borrower is able to engage in substantial gainful activity;

(2) Signs a statement acknowledging that any new Federal Perkins Loan the borrower receives cannot be discharged in the future on the basis of any present impairment, unless that condition substantially deteriorates; and

(3) If the borrower receives a new Federal Perkins Loan within three years of the date that any previous title IV loan or TEACH Grant service obligation was discharged due to a total and permanent disability in accordance with § 674.61(b)(3)(i), 34 CFR 682.402(c), 34 CFR 685.213, or 34 CFR 686.42(b) based on a discharge request received on or after July 1, 2010, resumes repayment on the previously discharged loan in accordance with § 674.61(b)(5), 34 CFR 682.402(c)(5), or 34 CFR 685.213(b)(4), or acknowledges that he or she is once again subject to the terms of the TEACH Grant agreement to serve before receiving the new loan.

(h) In the case of a borrower whose previous loan under title IV of the HEA was conditionally discharged after an initial determination that the borrower was totally and permanently disabled based on a discharge request received prior to July 1, 2010, the borrower must-

(1) Comply with the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section; and

(2) Sign a statement acknowledging that-

(i) The loan that has been conditionally discharged prior to a final determination of total and permanent disability cannot be discharged in the future on the basis of any impairment present when the borrower applied for a total and permanent disability discharge or when a new loan is made, unless that impairment substantially deteriorates; and

(ii) Collection activity will resume on any loan in a conditional discharge period.

(i) Does not have any loans under title IV of the HEA on which collection activity has been suspended based on a conditional determination that the borrower was totally and permanently disabled. If a borrower applies for a loan under title IV of the HEA during the conditional discharge period, the suspension of collection activity must be ended before the borrower becomes eligible to receive any additional loans.

(j) In the case of a borrower who is in default on a Federal Perkins Loan, NDSL or Defense loan, satisfies one of the conditions contained in § 674.5(c)(3)(i) or (ii) except that-

(1) For purposes of this section, voluntary payments made by the borrower under paragraph (i) of this section are payments made directly by the borrower; and

(2) Voluntary payments do not include payments obtained by Federal offset, garnishment, or income or asset execution.

(k) In the case of a borrower who is in default on an FFEL Program or a Direct Loan Program loan, makes satisfactory repayment arrangements as defined in 34 CFR 682.200(b) or 685.102(b) on the defaulted loan, as determined by the loan holder; and

(l) For purposes of this section, reaffirmation means the acknowledgment of the loan by the borrower in a legally binding manner. The acknowledgement may include, but is not limited to, the borrower-

(1) Signing a new promissory note or new repayment agreement; or

(2) Making a payment on the loan.
