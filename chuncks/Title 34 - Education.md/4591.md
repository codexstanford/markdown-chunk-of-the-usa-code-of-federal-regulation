###### § 463.750 When and how can a one-stop partner appeal a one-stop infrastructure amount designated by the State under the State infrastructure funding mechanism?

(a) The Governor must establish a process, described under sec. 121(h)(2)(E) of WIOA, for a one-stop partner administering a program described in §§ 463.400 through 463.410 to appeal the Governor's determination regarding the one-stop partner's portion of funds to be provided for one-stop infrastructure costs. This appeal process must be described in the Unified State Plan.

(b) The appeal may be made on the ground that the Governor's determination is inconsistent with proportionate share requirements in § 463.735(a), the cost contribution limitations in § 463.735(b), the cost contribution caps in § 463.738, consistent with the process described in the State Plan.

(c) The process must ensure prompt resolution of the appeal in order to ensure the funds are distributed in a timely manner, consistent with the requirements of 20 CFR 683.630.

(d) The one-stop partner must submit an appeal in accordance with State's deadlines for appeals specified in the guidance issued under § 463.705(b)(3), or if the State has not set a deadline, within 21 days from the Governor's determination.
