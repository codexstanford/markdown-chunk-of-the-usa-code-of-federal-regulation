####### § 303.405 Access rights.

(a) Each participating agency must permit parents to inspect and review any early intervention records relating to their children that are collected, maintained, or used by the agency under this part. The agency must comply with a parent's request to inspect and review records without unnecessary delay and before any meeting regarding an IFSP, or any hearing pursuant to §§ 303.430(d) and 303.435 through 303.439, and in no case more than 10 days after the request has been made.

(b) The right to inspect and review early intervention records under this section includes-

(1) The right to a response from the participating agency to reasonable requests for explanations and interpretations of the early intervention records;

(2) The right to request that the participating agency provide copies of the early intervention records containing the information if failure to provide those copies would effectively prevent the parent from exercising the right to inspect and review the records; and

(3) The right to have a representative of the parent inspect and review the early intervention records.

(c) An agency may presume that the parent has authority to inspect and review records relating to his or her child unless the agency has been provided documentation that the parent does not have the authority under applicable State laws governing such matters as custody, foster care, guardianship, separation, and divorce.
