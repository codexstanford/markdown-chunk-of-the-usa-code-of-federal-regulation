(1) Meet the application and eligibility requirements in section 7003 and subparts A and C of these regulations;

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, develop and implement policies and procedures in accordance with § 222.94; and

(ii) An assurance that the LEA has provided a written response to the comments, concerns and recommendations received through the Indian policies and procedures consultation process, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(iii) Either a copy of the policies and procedures, or documentation that the LEA has received a waiver in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) An LEA is not required to comply with § 222.94 with respect to students from a tribe that has provided the LEA with a waiver that meets the requirements of this paragraph.

(1) A waiver must contain a voluntary written statement from an appropriate tribal official or tribal governing body that-

(i) The LEA need not comply with § 222.94 because the tribe is satisfied with the LEA's provision of educational services to the tribe's students; and

(ii) The tribe was provided a copy of the requirements in § 222.91 and § 222.94, and understands the requirements that are being waived.

(2) The LEA must submit the waiver at the time of application.

(3) The LEA must obtain a waiver from each tribe that has Indian children living on Indian lands claimed by the LEA on its application under section 7003 of the Act.
