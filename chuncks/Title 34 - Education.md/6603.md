###### § 673.7 Administrative cost allowance.

(a) An institution participating in the Federal Perkins Loan, FWS, or FSEOG programs is entitled to an administrative cost allowance for an award year if it advances funds under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, provides FWS employment, or awards grants under the FSEOG Program to students in that year.

(b) An institution may charge the administrative cost allowance calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for an award year against-(1) The Federal Perkins Loan Fund, if the institution advances funds under the Federal Perkins Loan Program to students in that award year;

(2) The FWS allocation, if the institution provides FWS employment to students in that award year; and

(3) The FSEOG allocation, if the institution awards grants to students under the FSEOG program in that award year.

(c) For any award year, the amount of the administrative costs allowance equals-

(1) Five percent of the first $2,750,000 of the institution's total expenditures to students in that award year under the FWS, FSEOG, and the Federal Perkins Loan programs; plus

(2) Four percent of its expenditures to students that are greater than $2,750,000 but less than $5,500,000; plus

(3) Three percent of its expenditures to students that are $5,500,000 or more.
