####### § 222.120 When is a local educational agency exempt from withholding of payments?

Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Assistant Secretary does not withhold payments to an LEA under the following circumstances:

(a) The LEA documents that it has received a written statement from the affected Indian tribe or tribes that the LEA need not comply with section 8004 (a) and (b) of the Act, because the affected Indian tribe or tribes is satisfied with the provision of educational services by the LEA to the children claimed on the LEA's application for assistance under section 8003 of the Act.

(b) The Assistant Secretary receives from the affected Indian tribe or tribes a written request that meets the requirements of § 222.121 not to withhold payments from an LEA.

(c) The Assistant Secretary, on the basis of documentation provided by the LEA, determines that withholding payments during the course of the school year would substantially disrupt the educational programs of the LEA.

(d)(1) The affected Indian tribe or tribes elects to have educational services provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs under section 1101(d) of the Education Amendments of 1978.

(2) For an LEA described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the Secretary recalculates the section 8003 payment that the LEA is otherwise eligible to receive to reflect the number of students who remain in attendance at the LEA.
