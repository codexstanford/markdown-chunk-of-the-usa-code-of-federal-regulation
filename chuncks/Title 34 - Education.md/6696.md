###### § 674.35 Deferment of repayment - Federal Perkins loans made before July 1, 1993.

(a) The borrower may defer repayment on a Federal Perkins Loan made before July 1, 1993, during the periods described in this section.

(b)(1) The borrower need not repay principal, and interest does not accrue, during a period after the commencement or resumption of the repayment period on a loan, when the borrower is at least a half-time regular student at-

(i) An institution of higher education; or

(ii) A comparable institution outside the U.S. approved by the Secretary for this purpose.

(2) The institution of higher education does not need to be participating in the Federal Perkins Loan program for the borrower to qualify for a deferment.

(3) If a borrower is attending as at least a half-time regular student for a full academic year and intends to enroll as at least a half-time regular student in the next academic year, the borrower is entitled to deferment for 12 months.

(4) If an institution no longer qualifies as an institution of higher education, the borrower's deferment ends on the date the institution ceases to qualify.

(c) The borrower need not repay principal, and interest does not accrue, for any period not to exceed 3 years during which the borrower is-

(1) A member of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard or an officer in the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service (see § 674.59);

(2) On full-time active duty as a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps;

(5) A full-time volunteer in service which the Secretary has determined is comparable to service in the Peace Corps or under the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 (ACTION programs). The Secretary considers that a borrower is providing comparable service if he or she satisfies the following five criteria:

(i) The borrower serves in an organization that is exempt from taxation under the provisions of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

(ii) The borrower provides service to low-income persons and their communities to assist them in eliminating poverty and poverty-related human, social, and environmental conditions.

(iii) The borrower does not receive compensation that exceeds the rate prescribed under section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (the Federal minimum wage), except that the tax-exempt organization may provide health, retirement, and other fringe benefits to the volunteer that are substantially equivalent to the benefits offered to other employees of the organization.

(iv) The borrower has agreed to serve on a full-time basis for a term of at least one year.

(6) Temporarily totally disabled, as established by an affidavit of a qualified physician, or unable to secure gainful employment because the borrower is providing care, such as continuous nursing or other similar services, required by a dependent who is so disabled. As used in this paragraph-

(i) "Temporarily totally disabled", with regard to the borrower, means the inability by virtue of an injury or illness to attend an eligible institution or to be gainfully employed during a reasonable period of recovery; and

(ii) "Temporarily totally disabled", with regard to a disabled spouse or other dependent of a borrower, means requiring continuous nursing or other services from the borrower for a period of at least three months because of illness or injury.

(d)(1) The borrower need not repay principal, and interest does not accrue, for a period not to exceed two years during which time the borrower is serving an eligible internship.

(2) An eligible internship is one which-

(i) Requires the borrower to hold at least a baccalaureate degree before beginning the internship; and

(ii)(A) A State licensing agency requires an individual to complete as a prerequisite for certification for professional practice or service; or

(B) Is a part of an internship or residency program leading to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital, or a health care facility that offers postgraduate training.

(3) To qualify for an internship deferment as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the borrower must provide the institution with the following certifications:

(i) A statement from an official of the appropriate State licensing agency that successful completion of the internship program is a prerequisite for its certification of the individual for professional service or practice.

(ii) A statement from the organization with which the borrower is undertaking the internship program certifying-

(A) That a baccalaureate degree must be attained in order to be admitted into the internship program;

(B) That the borrower has been accepted into its internship program; and

(C) The anticipated dates on which the borrower will begin and complete the program.

(4) To qualify for an internship deferment as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the borrower must provide the institution with a statement from an authorized official of the internship program certifying that-

(ii) The borrower has been accepted into its internship program; and

(iii) The internship or residency program in which the borrower has been accepted leads to a degree or certificate awarded by an institution of higher education, a hospital or a health-care facility that offers postgraduate training.

(e) The borrower need not repay principal, and interest does not accrue, for a period not in excess of six months-

(1) During which the borrower is-

(i) Pregnant, caring for a newborn baby, or caring for a child immediately after placement of the child through adoption; and

(ii) Not attending an eligible institution of higher education or gainfully employed; and

(2) That begins not later than six months after a period in which the borrower was at least a half-time regular student at an eligible institution.

(f) The borrower need not repay principal, and interest does not accrue, for a period not in excess of one year during which the borrower-

(1) Is a mother of preschool age children;

(2) Has just entered or reentered the work force; and

(3) Is being compensated at a rate which is not more than $1.00 over the minimum hourly wage established by section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

(g) An institution may defer payments of principal and interest, but interest shall continue to accrue, if the institution determines this is necessary to avoid hardship to the borrower (see § 674.33(c)).

(h) The institution may not include the deferment periods described in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section and the period described in paragraph (i) of this section when determining the 10-year repayment period.
