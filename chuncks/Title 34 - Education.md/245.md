(2) The date of an order disposing of any petitions for reconsideration of the final order in the adversary adjudication;

(3) If no petition for reconsideration is filed, the last date on which that type of petition could have been filed; or

(4) The date of a final order or any other final resolution of a proceeding-such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal-that is not subject to a petition for reconsideration.
