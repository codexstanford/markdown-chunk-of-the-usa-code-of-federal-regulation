(1) File with the Secretary a complete and signed application for payment under section 8002 or section 8003; and

(2) Certify to the Secretary that it will file, and file, a copy of the application referred to in paragraph (a) of this section with its SEA.

(b)(1) If any of the following events that give rise to eligibility for payment occur after the filing deadline in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an LEA must file a complete and signed application within the time limits required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section:

(i) The United States Government initiates or reactivates a Federal activity, or acquires real property.

(ii) The United States Congress enacts new legislation.

(iii) A reorganization of school districts takes place.

(iv) Property, previously determined by the Secretary not to be Federal property, is determined in writing by the Secretary to be Federal property.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, within 60 days after the applicable event occurs but not later than June 30 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance under section 8002 or section 8003, the LEA must-

(i) File an application with the Secretary as permitted by paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

(ii) File a copy of that application with its SEA.

(c)(1) If the SEA wishes to notify the Secretary of any inconsistencies or other concerns with an LEA's application, the SEA must do so-

(i) For an application subject to the filing deadlines in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, on or before February 15 of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance under section 8002 or section 8003; and
