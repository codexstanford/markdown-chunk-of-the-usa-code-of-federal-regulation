##### § 86.404 How may a party communicate with an ALJ?

(a) A party may not communicate with an ALJ on any fact at issue in the case or on any matter relevant to the merits of the case unless the other party is given notice and an opportunity to participate.

(b)(1) To obtain an order or ruling from an ALJ, a party shall make a motion to the ALJ.

(2) Except for a request for an extension of time, a motion must be made in writing unless the parties appear in person or participate in a conference telephone call. The ALJ may require a party to reduce an oral motion to writing.

(3) If a party files a written motion, the party shall do so in accordance with § 86.405.

(4) Except for a request for an extension of time, the ALJ may not grant a party's written motion without the consent of the other party unless the other party has had at least 21 days from the date of service of the motion to respond. However, the ALJ may deny a motion without awaiting a response.

(5) The date of service of a motion is determined by the standards for determining a filing date in § 86.405(d).
