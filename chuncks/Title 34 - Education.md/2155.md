###### § 222.152 When may a local educational agency request reconsideration of a determination?

(a)(1) An LEA may request reconsideration of any determination made by the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) under the Act, either in addition to or instead of requesting an administrative hearing under § 222.151.

(2) A request for reconsideration, or actual reconsideration by the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee), does not extend the time within which an applicant must file a request for an administrative hearing under § 222.151, unless the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) extends that time limit in writing.

(b) The Secretary's (or the Secretary's delegatee's) consideration of a request for reconsideration is not prejudiced by a pending request for an administrative hearing on the same matter, or the fact that a matter has been scheduled for a hearing. The Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) may, but is not required to, postpone the administrative hearing due to a request for reconsideration.

(c) The Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) may reconsider any determination under the Act concerning a particular party unless the determination has been the subject of an administrative hearing under this part with respect to that party.
