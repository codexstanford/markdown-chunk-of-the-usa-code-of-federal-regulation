(a) After an Insular Area receives a consolidated grant, it may reallocate the funds in a manner different from the allocation described in its consolidated grant application. However, the funds cannot be used for purposes that are not authorized under the programs in the consolidated grant under which funds are to be used and administered.

(b) If an Insular Area decides to reallocate the funds it receives under a consolidated grant, it shall notify the Secretary by amending its original application to include an update of the information required under § 76.131.
