###### § 222.66 How does a local educational agency lose and resume eligibility under section 8003(b)(2)?

(a) A continuing heavily impacted LEA that fails to meet the eligibility requirements in § 222.63 in any fiscal year or a new heavily impacted LEA that received a section 8003(b)(2) payment but then fails to meet the eligibility requirements in § 222.64 will still receive a heavily impacted payment in the first year of ineligibility, based on the number of children in ADA that would be counted for that application if the LEA were eligible.

(b)(1) A continuing heavily impacted LEA may resume eligibility for a heavily impacted payment if it applies in the fiscal year preceding the year for which it seeks eligibility and it meets the eligibility requirements in § 222.63 for both fiscal years.

(2) In the first fiscal year that a continuing heavily impacted LEA qualifies to resume eligibility, it cannot receive a heavily impacted payment but instead will receive a basic support payment under section 8003(b)(1) for that year.

(c) A new heavily impacted LEA may resume eligibility for a heavily impacted payment if it meets the eligibility requirements in § 222.64 for the fiscal year for which it seeks a payment.
