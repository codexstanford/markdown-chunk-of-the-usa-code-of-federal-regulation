(b) If you have one or more borrowers entering repayment or are subject to sanctions, or if the Department believes you will have an official cohort default rate calculated as an average rate, you will receive a loan record detail report as part of your eCDR notification package.

(c) You have five business days, from the transmission date for eCDR notification packages as posted on the Department's Web site, to report any problem with receipt of the electronic transmission of your eCDR notification package.

(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, timelines for submitting challenges, adjustments, and appeals begin on the sixth business day following the transmission date for eCDR notification packages that is posted on the Department's Web site.

(e) If you timely report a problem with the receipt of the electronic transmission of your eCDR notification package under paragraph (c) of this section and the Department agrees that the problem with transmission was not caused by you, the Department will extend the challenge, appeal and adjustment deadlines and timeframes to account for a retransmission of your eCDR notification package after the technical problem is resolved.
