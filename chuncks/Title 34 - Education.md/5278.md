(2)(i) If an applicant for a new grant proposes to continue to serve substantially the same target population and schools that the applicant is serving under an expiring project, the Secretary evaluates the applicant's prior experience of high quality service delivery under the expiring Upward Bound project on the basis of the outcome criteria in § 645.32.

(ii) The maximum total score for all the criteria in § 645.32 is 15 points. The maximum score for each criterion is indicated in parentheses with the criterion.

(iii) The Secretary evaluates the PE of an applicant for each of the three project years that the Secretary designates in thenotice inviting applications and the other published application materials for the competition.
