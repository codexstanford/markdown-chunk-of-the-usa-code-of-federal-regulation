### PART 12 - DISPOSAL AND UTILIZATION OF SURPLUS FEDERAL REAL PROPERTY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES
#### Subpart B - Distribution of Surplus Federal Real Property
##### § 12.7 How is surplus Federal real property disposed of when there is more than one applicant?

(a) If there is more than one applicant for the same surplus Federal real property, the Secretary transfers or leases the property to the applicant whose proposed program and plan of use the Secretary determines provides the greatest public benefit, using the criteria contained in appendix A to this part that broadly address the weight given to each type of entity applying and its proposed program and plan of use. (See example in § 12.10(d)).

(b) If, after applying the criteria described in paragraph (a) of this section, two or more applicants are rated equally, the Secretary transfers or leases the property to one of the applicants after-

(1) Determining the need for each applicant's proposed educational use at the site of the surplus Federal real property;

(2) Considering the quality of each applicant's proposed program and plan of use; and

(3) Considering each applicant's ability to carry out its proposed program and plan of use.

(c) If the Secretary determines that the surplus Federal real property is capable of serving more than one applicant, the Secretary may apportion it to fit the needs of as many applicants as is practicable.

(d)(1) The Secretary generally transfers surplus Federal real property to a selected applicant that meets the requirements of this part.

(2) Alternatively, the Secretary may lease surplus Federal real property to a selected applicant that meets the requirements of this part if the Secretary determines that a lease will promote the most effective use of the property consistent with the purposes of this part or if having a lease is otherwise in the best interest of the United States, as determined by the Secretary.
