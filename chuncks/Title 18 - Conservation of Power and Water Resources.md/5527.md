### PART 1307 - NONDISCRIMINATION WITH RESPECT TO HANDICAP
#### § 1307.4 Discrimination prohibited.
##### Specific discriminatory actions.

(b)(1) A recipient to which this part applies shall not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap:

(i) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or services available under the program or activity;

(ii) Afford a qualified handicapped person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others under the program or activity;

(iii) Provide a qualified handicapped person with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others under the program or activity;

(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped persons or to any class of handicapped persons than is provided to others, unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others under the program or activity;

(v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped person by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or entity that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;

(vi) Deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards with respect to the program or activity; or

(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped person in the enjoyment under the program of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others under the program or activity.

(2) A recipient shall not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate under the program or activity in aid, benefits, or services that are not separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or different aid, benefits, or services.

(3) A recipient shall not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap, (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to handicapped persons, or (iii) that perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control.

(4) A recipient shall not, in determining the site or location of a facility under the program or activity, make selections (i) that have the effect of excluding handicapped persons from, denying them the benefits of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under the program or activity, or (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to handicapped persons.

(c) The exclusion of nonhandicapped persons from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal statute or executive order to handicapped persons or the exclusion of a specific class of handicapped persons from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal statute or executive order to a different class of handicapped persons is not prohibited by this part.

(d) Recipients shall administer programs or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons. A recipient who wishes to establish a policy of separate aid, benefits, or services or different treatment for handicapped and nonhandicapped persons shall request and receive written approval from TVA before instituting such policy or undertaking any such separate treatment.

(e) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications to their applicants, employees, and beneficiaries are available to such persons with impaired vision and hearing.
