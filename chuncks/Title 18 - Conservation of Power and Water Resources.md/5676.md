#### § 1311.9 How does TVA receive and respond to comments?

(a) TVA follows the procedures in § 1311.10 if:

(1) A state office or official is designated to act as a single point of contact between a state process and all federal agencies, and

(2) That office or official transmits a state process recommendation for a program selected under § 1311.6.

(b)(1) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit comments from state, areawide, regional, or local officials and entities where there is no state process recommendation; however, these officials or entities may submit comments directly to TVA for TVA's consideration.

(2) If a state process recommendation is transmitted by a single point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.

(c) If a state has not established a process, or is unable to submit a state process recommendation, state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities may submit comments to TVA.

(d) If a program or activity is not selected for a state process, state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities may submit comments to TVA. In addition, if a state process recommendation for a nonselected program or activity is transmitted to TVA by the single point of contact, TVA follows the procedures of § 1311.10 of this part.

(e) TVA considers comments which do not constitute a state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for which TVA is not required to apply the procedures of § 1311.10 of this part, when such comments are provided by a single point of contact or directly to TVA by a state, areawide, regional, or local government.
