#### PART 3b - COLLECTION, MAINTENANCE, USE, AND DISSEMINATION OF RECORDS OF IDENTIFIABLE PERSONAL INFORMATION
##### Subpart C - Rules for Disclosure of Records
###### § 3b.225 Written consent for disclosure.

(a) The Commission will not disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to any other agency, unless it has the written request by, or the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains and under whose individual name, or some other identifying particular, the record is filed. The written request or consent should include, at a minimum, the general purposes for or the types of recipients to whom disclosure may be made. The fact that an individual is informed of the purposes for which information will be used when information is collected pursuant to § 3b.202(b)(2) will not constitute consent.

(b) A written request or consent is not required if the disclosure is:

(1) To those officers and employees of the Commission who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties;

(2) Required under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended;

(3) For a routine use as defined in § 3b.2(g) of this part and as described in the public notice for each system of records;

(4) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of title 13 of the United States Code;

(5) To a recipient who has provided the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable. The written statement of assurance should include at a minimum:

(i) A statement of the purpose for requesting the record; and

(ii) Certification that the record will only be used for statistical purposes.

(6) To the National Archives of the United States, pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2103, as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or for the evaluation by the Administrator of General Services or his designee to determine whether the record has such value;

(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality, or his delegated official, has made a written request to the appropriate system manager specifying the particular portion of the record desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is being sought;

(8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual (not necessarily the individual to whom the record pertains), if, upon disclosure, notification of such is sent to the last known address of the individual to whom the record pertains;

(9) To either House of Congress, or to any committee or subcommittee thereof, on a matter within its jurisdiction;

(10) To the Comptroller General, or any of his authorized representatives, in the course of the performance of the duties of the General Accounting Office; or

(11) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(c) When a record is disclosed under compulsory legal process and such process becomes a matter of public record, the system manager will make reasonable efforts to notify the individual to whom the record pertains. A notice will be sent to the individual's last known address noted in the Commission's files.

(d) The appropriate system manager shall notify all prior recipients of records, disclosure to whom an accounting was made pursuant to § 3b.226, of any amendments made to the records, including corrections, amendments and notations of dispute made pursuant to §§ 3b.224(c)(1) and 3b.224(e)(1) and (2)(v), within ten days of receipt of the corrected information or notation of dispute (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), except under unusual circumstances [see circumstances described in § 3b.220(d)].

(e) The content of the records disclosed under this section shall be maintained pursuant to the standards established in § 3b.201(c).
