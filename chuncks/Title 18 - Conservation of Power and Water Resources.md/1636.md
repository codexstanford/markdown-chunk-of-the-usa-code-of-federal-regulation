The annual Electric Reliability Organization budget shall include line item budgets for the activities of each Regional Entity that are delegated or assigned to each Regional Entity pursuant to § 39.8.

(d) On a demonstration of unforeseen and extraordinary circumstances requiring additional funds prior to the next Electric Reliability Organization fiscal year, the Electric Reliability Organization may file with the Commission for authorization to collect a special assessment. Such filing shall include supporting materials explaining the proposed collection in sufficient detail to justify the requested funding, including any departure from the approved funding formula or method.

(f) Any person who submits an application for certification as the Electric Reliability Organization may include in the application a plan for a transitional funding mechanism that would allow such person, if certified as the Electric Reliability Organization, to continue existing operations without interruption as it transitions from one method of funding to another. Any proposed transitional funding plan should terminate no later than eighteen (18) months from the date of Electric Reliability Organization certification.

(g) The Electric Reliability Organization or a Regional Entity may not engage in any activity or receive revenues from any person that, in the judgment of the Commission represents a significant distraction from, or a conflict of interest with, its responsibilities under this part.
