(a) Any individual whose request for a correction or amendment, requested by him, to a record has been denied, in whole or in part, may appeal that decision to the Director of the Council.

(b) The appeal will be in writing and will:

(1) Name the individual making the appeal;

(2) Identify the record sought to be amended;

(3) Name the record system in which that record is contained;

(4) Contain a short statement describing the amendment sought; and

(2) The specific civil remedies available to the requester as per section 2(g) of Pub. L. 93-579, as well as notice that additional remedies may be appropriate and available to enable the full exercise of the requester's rights at law.

(3) The right to file with the Council a concise statement setting forth the requester's reasons for disagreement with the Council's refusal to correct or amend the record.
