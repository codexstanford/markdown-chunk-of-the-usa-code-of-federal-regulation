(a) All Major and Nonmajor public utilities and licensees not classified as Class C or Class D prior to January 1, 1984 shall secure, for the year 1968 and each year thereafter until December 31, 1975, the services of an independent certified public accountant, or independent licensed public accountant, certified or licensed by a regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of the United States, to test compliance in all material respects of those schedules as are indicated in the General Instructions set out in the Annual Report, Form No. 1, with the Commission's applicable Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases. The Commission expects that identification of questionable matters by the independent accountant will facilitate their early resolution and that the independent accountant will seek advisory rulings by the Commission on such items. This examination shall be deemed supplementary to periodic Commission examinations of compliance.

(b) Beginning January 1, 1976, and each year thereafter, only independent certified public accountants, or independent licensed public accountants who were licensed on or before December 31, 1970, will be authorized to conduct annual audits and to certify to compliance in all material respects, of those schedules as are indicated in the General Instructions set out in the Annual Report, Form No. 1, with the Commission's applicable Uniform System of Accounts, published accounting releases and all other regulatory matters.
