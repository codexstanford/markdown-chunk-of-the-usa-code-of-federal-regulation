###### § 154.206 Motion to place suspended rates into effect.

(a) If, prior to the end of the suspension period, the Commission has issued an order requiring changes in the filed rates, or the filed rates recover costs for facilities not certificated and in service as of the proposed effective date, in order to place the suspended rates into effect, the pipeline must file a motion at least one day prior to the effective date requested by the pipeline. The motion must be accompanied by revised tariff sheets or sections reflecting any changes ordered by the Commission or modifications approved by the Commission during the suspension period under § 154.205. The filing of the revised tariff sheets or sections must:

(1) Comply with the requirements of subparts A, B, and C of this part;

(2) Identify the Commission order directing the revision;

(3) List the modifications made to the currently effective rate during the suspension period, the docket number in which the modifications were filed, and identify the order permitting the modifications.

(b) Where the Commission has suspended the effective date of a change of rate, charge, classification, or service for a minimal period and the pipeline has not included a motion in its transmittal letter, or has specified in its transmittal letter pursuant to § 154.7(a)(9), that it reserves its right to file motion to place the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service into effect at the end of the suspension period, the change will go into effect, subject to refund, upon motion of the pipeline.

(c) Where the Commission has suspended the effective date of a change of rate, charge, classification, or service for a minimal period and the pipeline has included, in its transmittal letter pursuant to § 154.7(a)(9), a motion to place the proposed change of rate, charge, classification, or service into effect at the end of the suspension period, the change will go into effect, subject to refund, on the authorized effective date.
