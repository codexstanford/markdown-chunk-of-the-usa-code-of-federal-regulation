###### § 367.57 Equipment.

(a) The cost of equipment chargeable to the service company property accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the related net purchase price, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the service company, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the service company in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of property.

(b) Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools, that are likely to be lost or stolen or that have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the related accounting as service company property is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment must be included in the appropriate property account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, or similar items, or in stores, must be charged to the property account appropriate for their use.

(c) The equipment accounts must include angle irons and similar items that are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations that are designed to be as permanent as the buildings that house the equipment, or that are constructed as a part of the building and that cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, must be included in the building accounts.

(d) The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service must be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, and similar items, guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase may be charged to the appropriate service company property account.
