#### § 1309.19 When may a complainant file a civil action?

(a) A complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are exhausted if:

(1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and TVA has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or

(2) TVA issues any finding in favor of the recipient.

(b) If either of the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section is satisfied, TVA shall:

(1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact; and

(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right, under Section 305(e) of the Act, to bring a civil action for injunctive relief that will effect the purposes of the Act; and

(3) Inform the complainant:

(i) That a civil action can only be brought in a United States district court for the district in which the recipient is found or transacts business;

(ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that these costs must be demanded in the complaint;

(iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 30 days' notice by registered mail to the Secretary, the Attorney General of the United States, TVA, and the recipient;

(iv) That the notice shall state: the alleged violation of the Act; the relief requested; the court in which the action will be brought; and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

(v) That no action shall be brought if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.
