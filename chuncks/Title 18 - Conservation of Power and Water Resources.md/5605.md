##### § 1308.36 Accelerated appeal procedure.

(a) The Contractor may elect to have the appeal processed under this section if the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less. The amount shall be determined by totalling the amounts claimed by TVA and Contractor.

(b) Appeals under this section shall be decided, whenever possible, within 180 days after the Hearing Officer receives written notice that the Contractor has elected to proceed under this section. Such election may be made a part of the notice of appeal.

(c) In cases under this section, the parties are encouraged to limit discovery and briefing, consistent with adequate presentation of their positions. The Hearing Officer may shorten applicable time periods in order to meet the 180-day period, and may reserve 30 days to prepare a decision.

(d) The Hearing Officer's decision under this section will be short and may contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions of law. The decision may, at the Hearing Officer's election, be rendered orally at the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, following such oral argument as may be permitted. In such case, the Hearing Officer will promptly furnish the parties a typed copy of the decision, which shall constitute the final decision.
