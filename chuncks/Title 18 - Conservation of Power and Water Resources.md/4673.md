###### § 401.112 Exempt information.

The following materials and information covered by this part shall be exempt from disclosure; that is, information that is:

(a) Related solely to the internal personnel matters of the Commission;

(b) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;

(c) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential. (For purposes of this section a trade secret may consist of any formula, pattern, device, or compilation of information which is used in one's business and which gives him an opportunity to obtain an advantage over competitors who do not know or use it. Commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential means valuable data or information which is used in one's business and is of a type customarily held in strict confidence or regarded as privileged and not disclosed to any member of the public by the person to whom it belongs.)

(d) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters other than purely factual compilations, which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Commission;

(e) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; and

(f) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records would (1) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (2) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (3) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (4) disclose the identity of a confidential source, (5) disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or (6) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.
