###### § 3b.224 Requests to amend records and disputes thereon.

(a) Upon written request, either in person or by mail, to the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records, any individual may amend records in a system of records pertaining to him and filed under his individual name or some other identifying particular. Such requests should contain identifying information needed to locate the record, a brief description of the item or items of information to be amended, and information in support of the request for amendment. The individual may obtain assistance in preparing his request to amend a record from the appropriate system manager.

(b) The system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend within ten days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Such an acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional information needed to make a determination which the individual may reasonably be expected to know, and verification of identity consistent with § 3b.222. The acknowledgement will clearly describe the request and advise the individual requesting the amendment when he may expect to be notified of action taken on the request. No acknowledgement is required if the request can be reviewed, processed, and the individual notified of compliance or denial within the ten-day period.

(c) The system manager will complete the review and advise the individual in writing of the results within twenty days of the receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the system manager is unable to complete the review within twenty days of the receipt of the request, he will inform the individual in writing as to the reasons therefor (for good cause shown) and when it is anticipated that the review will be completed. If the completion date for the review indicated in the acknowledgement cannot be met, the system manager will advise the individual in writing of the delay, the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and of a revised date when the review may be expected to be completed. Such extensions will not exceed thirty days from receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The system manager will take one of the following actions:

(1) Make the requested correction or amendment; so advise the individual in writing; and, where an accounting of the disclosure of the record was made pursuant to § 3b.226, advise all previous recipients of the record in writing of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment [see § 3b.225(d)]; or

(2) Inform the individual in writing of the refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request; the reasons for the refusal including any of the standards which were employed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section in conducting the review; the right of the individual, within thirty days of receipt of the refusal, to request in writing a review of the refusal by the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or by an officer designated by the Chairman pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section; and the right of the individual to seek advice or assistance from the system manager in obtaining such a review.

(d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the system manager and the Chairman, or the officer he designates pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, shall assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of the record. They shall consider the record in terms of the criteria established in § 3b.201 of this part.

(e) The Chairman, or officer designated pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the individual's request for review, will complete such review, unless, for good cause shown, the Chairman, or designated officer, extends the thirty-day period in a writing to the individual with reasons for the delay and the approximate date on which the review is expected to be completed. Such an extension will not exceed thirty-five days from receipt of the request for review (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The Chairman, or designated officer, will make one of the following determinations:

(1) Make the correction in accordance with the individual's request and proceed as in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or

(2) Inform the individual in writing of:

(i) The refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request,

(ii) The reasons therefor, including any of the standards which were employed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section in conducting the review;

(iii) The right of the individual to file with the Chairman, or designated officer, a concise written statement setting forth the reasons for his disagreement with the decision;

(iv) The fact that the statement of disagreement will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, together with the portion of the record which is disputed clearly noted, and, with, at the discretion of the Chairman, or designated officer, a brief statement by the Chairman, or designated officer, summarizing the reasons for refusing to amend the record;

(v) Where an accounting of the disclosure of the record was made pursuant to § 3b.226 of this part, the fact that prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of the individual's statement of disagreement, with the portion of the record which is disputed clearly noted, and, at the Chairman's or designated officer's discretion, the statement summarizing the refusal to amend [see § 3b.225(d)]; and

(vi) The individual's right to seek judicial review of the refusal to amend.

(f) The Chairman may designate, in writing, another officer of the Commission to act in his capacity for the purposes of this part. The officer will be organizationally independent of or senior to the system manager who made the initial determination and will conduct a review independent of the initial determination.
