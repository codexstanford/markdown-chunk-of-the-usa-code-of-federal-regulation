###### § 367.53 Service company property purchased or sold.

(a) When service company property is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including related incidental expenses, must be charged to the appropriate service company property accounts and account 107, Construction work in progress (§ 367.1070), as appropriate.

(b) If property acquired is in a physical condition so that it is necessary to rehabilitate it substantially in order to bring the property up to the standards of the service company, the cost of the work, except replacements, must be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property.

(c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, all service company property acquired from an affiliate company must be recorded at its book value. Additionally, if property is acquired that is in excess of $10 million and has been previously devoted to public service at a price above book value, the service company must file with the Commission the proposed journal entries associated with the acquisition within six months from the date of acquisition of the property.

(d) When service company property is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another must be credited to the appropriate service company property accounts. The amounts (estimated, if not known) carried with respect the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization must be charged to those accounts. The difference, if any, between the net amount of debits and credits and the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) must be included in account 421.1, Gain on disposition of property (§ 367.4211), or account 421.2, Loss on disposition of property (§ 367.4212).

(e) In connection with the acquisition of service company property previously devoted to service company operations or acquired from an associate company, the service company must procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired or related certified copies, and must preserve the records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction.
