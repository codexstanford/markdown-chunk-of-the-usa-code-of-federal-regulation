##### § 1308.37 Decisions.

(a) The Hearing Officer's decision shall be in writing. Except as provided by § 1308.35 or § 1308.36, the decision shall contain complete findings of fact and conclusions of law. The parties may be directed to submit proposed findings and conclusions. A decision against a Contractor on a claim shall include notice of the Contractor's rights under paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 10(a) of the Act.

(b) If the decision denies any part of a Contractor's claim for lack of support and the Hearing Officer is of the opinion that the Contractor's inability to support that part is within § 1308.6 and section 5 of the Act, the decision shall not state that opinion, but contemporaneously with the decision the Hearing Officer shall separately notify TVA's General Counsel of that opinion and the reasons therefor.

(c) Not later than 10 days after receipt of the decision, a party may move to alter or amend the findings or make additional findings and amend the conclusions and decision accordingly. Such a motion may be combined with a motion under § 1308.38. This time period cannot be extended.
