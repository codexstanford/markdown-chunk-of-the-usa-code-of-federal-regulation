(2) Avoidance of performing activities within floodplains or wetlands wherever there is a practicable alternative;

(3) Where avoidance of floodplains cannot be achieved, minimization of adverse impacts and support of floodplain development, and preservation and restoration of natural and beneficial floodplain values; and

(4) Where avoidance of wetlands cannot be achieved, minimization of adverse impacts and support of new construction in wetlands, and preservation and enhancement of natural and beneficial wetlands values.

(c) Program funds must be obligated within the grant period unless the Council, based on written request, grants an exception or extension to this time limitation.
