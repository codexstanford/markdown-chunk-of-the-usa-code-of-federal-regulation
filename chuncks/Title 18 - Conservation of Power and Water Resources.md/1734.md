#### PART 50 - APPLICATIONS FOR PERMITS TO SITE INTERSTATE ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION FACILITIES
##### § 50.6 Applications: general content.

Each application filed under this part must provide the following information:

(a) The exact legal name of applicant; its principal place of business; whether the applicant is an individual, partnership, corporation, or otherwise; the State laws under which the applicant is organized or authorized; and the name, title, and mailing address of the person or persons to whom communications concerning the application are to be addressed.

(b) A concise description of applicant's existing operations.

(c) A concise general description of the proposed project sufficient to explain its scope and purpose. The description must, at a minimum: Describe the proposed geographic location of the principal project features and the planned routing of the transmission line; contain the general characteristics of the transmission line including voltage, types of towers, origin and termination points of the transmission line, and the geographic character of area traversed by the line; and be accompanied by an overview map of sufficient scale to show the entire transmission route on one or a few 8.5 by 11-inch sheets.

(d) Verification that the proposed route lies within a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the Secretary of the Department of Energy under section 216 of the Federal Power Act.

(e) Evidence that:

(1) A State in which the transmission facilities are to be constructed or modified does not have the authority to approve the siting of the facilities or consider the interstate benefits expected to be achieved by the proposed construction or modification of transmission facilities in the State;

(2) The applicant is a transmitting utility but does not qualify to apply for a permit or siting approval of the proposed project in a State because the applicant does not serve end-use customers in the State; or

(3) A State commission or other entity that has the authority to approve the siting of the facilities has:

(i) Withheld approval for more than one year after the filing of an application seeking approval under applicable law or one year after the designation of the relevant national interest electric transmission corridor, whichever is later; or

(ii) Conditioned its approval in such a manner that the proposed construction or modification will not significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce or is not economically feasible.

(f) A demonstration that the facilities to be authorized by the permit will be used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, and that the proposed construction or modification:

(1) Is consistent with the public interest;

(2) Will significantly reduce transmission congestion in interstate commerce and protects or benefits consumers;

(3) Is consistent with sound national energy policy and will enhance energy interdependence; and

(4) Will maximize, to the extent reasonable and economical, the transmission capabilities of existing towers or structures.

(g) A description of the proposed construction and operation of the facilities, including the proposed dates for the beginning and completion of construction and the commencement of service.

(h) A general description of project financing.

(i) A full statement as to whether any other application to supplement or effectuate the applicant's proposals must be or is to be filed by the applicant, any of the applicant's customers, or any other person, with any other Federal, State, Tribal, or other regulatory body; and if so, the nature and status of each such application.
