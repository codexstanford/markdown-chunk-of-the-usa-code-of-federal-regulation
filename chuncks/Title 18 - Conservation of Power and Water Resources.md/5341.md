##### § 1301.64 Original classification authority.

(a) Original classification authority is granted by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. TVA does not have original classification authority.

(b) If information is developed that appears to require classification, or is received from any foreign government information as defined in section 6.1(s) of Executive Order 13526, the individual in custody of the information shall immediately notify the Senior Agency Official and appropriately protect the information.

(c) If the Senior Agency Official believes the information warrants classification, it shall be sent to the appropriate agency with original classification authority over the subject matter, or to the Information Security Oversight Office, for review and a classification determination.

(d) If there is reasonable doubt about the need to classify information, it shall be safeguarded as if it were classified pending a determination by an original classification authority. If there is reasonable doubt about the appropriate level of classification, it shall be safeguarded at the higher level of classification pending a determination by an original classification authority.
