The following procedures apply to any certificate holder which undertakes a project to be authorized under a blanket certificate issued pursuant to subparts E or F of part 157 and to any other service subject to § 157.206(b) of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations.

Pursuant to § 157.206(b)(7) of the Commission's regulations, the certificate holder shall, upon acceptance of its blanket certificate, be designated as the Commission's non-Federal representative to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in order to conduct informal consultations with those agencies. For purposes of this appendix, "listed species" and "critical habitat" shall have the same meanings as set forth in 50 CFR 402.02. The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(vi) of the Commission's regulations only if, prior to constructing facilities or abandoning facilities by removal under the blanket certificate, it complies with the following procedures:

1. The certificate holder shall contact the appropriate regional office of either the FWS or the NMFS (or both the FWS and the NMFS, if appropriate) as determined pursuant to 50 CFR 402.01 for the purpose of initiating informal consultations.

2. The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(vi) of the Commission's regulations if the consulted agency (either the FWS or NMFS, or both if appropriate) initially determines, pursuant to the informal consultations:

(a) That no listed species or its critical habitat occur in the project area; and

(b) That no species proposed to be listed under 16 U.S.C. 1533 or its critical habitat occur in the project area.

3. If the consulted agency, pursuant to the informal consultations, initially determines that any species proposed to be listed under 16 U.S.C. 1533 or its critical habitat occur in the project area, then the certificate holder shall confer with the consulted agency on how potential impact can be avoided or reduced. Upon completion of the conference and the implementation of any mitigating measures the certificate holder elects to implement, and compliance with paragraph 4 of this Appendix, if applicable, the certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(vi) of the Commission's regulations.

4. (a) If the consulted agency initially determines, pursuant to the informal consultations, that a listed species or its critical habitat may occur in the project area, then the certificate holder shall continue informal consultation with the consulted agency to determine if the proposed project may affect such species or habitat. Continued informal consultations may include discussions with experts (including experts provided by the consulted agency), field surveys, biological assessments, and formulation of mitigation measures.

(b) The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(vi) of the Commission's regulations if the consulted agency agrees with the certificate holder's determination resulting from the continued informal consultations, that the proposed project is not likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat, or that no further consultation is necessary.

(c) If the consulted agency does not agree with such determination by the certificate holder, or if the certificate holder concludes that the proposed project may affect listed species or the critical habitat of such species, then the certificate holder may not proceed with the proposed project under the blanket certificate.
