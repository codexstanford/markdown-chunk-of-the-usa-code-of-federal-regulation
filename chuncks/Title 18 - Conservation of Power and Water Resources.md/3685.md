####### § 367.2540 Account 254, Other regulatory liabilities.

(a) This account must include the amounts of regulatory liabilities, not includible in other accounts, imposed on the service company by the ratemaking actions of regulatory agencies. (See Definitions § 367.1(a)(38).)

(b) The amounts included in this account are to be established by those credits which would have been included in net income, or accumulated other comprehensive income, determinations in the current period under the general requirements of the USofA but for it being probable that: Such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing the rates that the service company is authorized to charge for its services; or refunds to customers, not provided for in other accounts, will be required. When specific identification of the particular source of the regulatory liability cannot be made or when the liability arises from revenues collected pursuant to tariffs on file at a regulatory agency, account 407.3, Regulatory debits (§ 367.4073), must be debited. The amounts recorded in this account generally are to be credited to the same account that would have been credited if included in income when earned except: All regulatory liabilities established through the use of account 407.3 (§ 367.4073) must be credited to account 407.4, Regulatory credits (§ 367.4074); and in the case of refunds, a cash account or other appropriate account should be credited when the obligation is satisfied.

(c) If it is later determined that the amounts recorded in this account will not be returned to customers through rates or refunds, such amounts must be credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), or Account 434, Extraordinary income (§ 367.4340), as appropriate, in the year such determination is made.

(d) The records supporting the entries to this account must be so kept that the service company can furnish full information as to the nature and amount of each regulatory liability included in this account, including justification for inclusion of such amounts in this account.
