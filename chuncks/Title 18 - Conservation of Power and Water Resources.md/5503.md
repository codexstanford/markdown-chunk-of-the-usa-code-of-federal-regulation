##### § 1306.2 Uniform real property acquisition policy.

(a) Before negotiations are initiated for acquisition of real property, the Chief of TVA's Land Branch will cause the property to be appraised and establish an amount believed to be just compensation therefor. The appraiser shall afford the owner or his representative an opportunity to accompany him during his inspection of the property.

(b) When negotiations are initiated to acquire real property, the owner will be given a written statement of, and summary of the basis for, the amount estimated as just compensation. The statement will identify the property and the interest therein to be acquired, including buildings and other improvements to be acquired as a part of the real property, the amount of the estimated just compensation, and the basis therefor. If only a portion of the property is to be acquired, the statement will include a statement of damages and benefits, if any, to the remainder.
