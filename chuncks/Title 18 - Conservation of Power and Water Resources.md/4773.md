##### § 430.25 Other permit requirements.

(a) Except to the extent provided in these regulations, registration of existing ground and surface water withdrawals and the issuance of withdrawal permits hereunder shall not create any private or proprietary rights in the water of the basin and the Commission reserves the right to amend, alter, or repeal these regulations and to amend, alter or rescind any actions taken hereunder in order to insure the proper control, use and management of the water resources of the basin.

(b) Neither the obligation to obtain a protected area permit under this regulation, nor the receipt thereof, shall relieve the sponsor of a new or expanded ground water withdrawal project of the obligation to obtain any other applicable permits required by Federal, state or local government agencies.

(c) A new or expanded ground water withdrawal subject to the requirement of a protected area permit under this regulation shall not require any further approval by the Commission if the daily average withdrawal during any calendar month is less than 100,000 gallons. If the new or expanded withdrawal exceeds a daily average of 100,000 gallons during any calendar month, the project shall be subject to review and approval by the commission pursuant to section 3.8 of the Delaware River Basin Compact, and the requirement of a protected area permit for such a project shall be in addition to other requirements of the Commission and its Rules of Practice and Procedure.
