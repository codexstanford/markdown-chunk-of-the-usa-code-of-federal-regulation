Each such request of a record or a copy of it will be made at the place specified in the notice describing that system of records, either in writing or in person. Requests may be made by agents, parents, or guardians of individuals as described in § 701.310(a) and (b).

(b) The request for access to or disclosure of a record should specifically identify the systems of records involved.

(c) The Council will attempt to affirm or deny a request within 10 working days from the time it receives the request or to inform the requester of the need for additional time, additional information, identification, or the tendering of fees (as specified in § 701.312), within 10 working days; except that if the request for access was not preceded by a notification request as provided in § 701.302, then the 10-day period will not begin until after such time as it has been determined that the record exists. If a request is complied with within 10 working days, no separate acknowledgement will be made.
