### PART 1309 - NONDISCRIMINATION WITH RESPECT TO AGE
#### § 1309.6 Is the normal operation or statutory objective of any program or activity an exception to the rules against age discrimination?

A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited by § 1309.5, if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:

(a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and

(b) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and

(c) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and

(d) It is impractical to measure the other characteristic(s) directly on an individual basis.
