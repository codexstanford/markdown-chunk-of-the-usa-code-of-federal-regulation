##### § 1318.601 Area of impact.

(a) If a proposed action will potentially occur in or affect wetlands or floodplains, the initiating TVA entity, as soon as practicable in the planning process, will request the appropriate TVA staff with expertise in floodplain or wetland impact evaluations ("TVA staff") to determine whether the proposed action will occur in or affect a wetland or floodplain and the level of impact, if any, on the wetland or floodplain.

(b) Further floodplain or wetland evaluation is unnecessary if the TVA staff determines that the proposed action:

(1) Is outside the floodplain or wetland,

(2) Has no identifiable impacts on a floodplain or wetland, and

(3) Does not directly or indirectly support floodplain development or wetland alteration.
