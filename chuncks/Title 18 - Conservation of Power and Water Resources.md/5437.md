(1) Power lines, poles, electrical panel, and wiring must be installed:

(i) In a way that would not be hazardous to the public or interfere with TVA operations;

(ii) Solely to serve water-use facilities, and

(iii) In compliance with all State and local electrical codes (satisfactory evidence of compliance to be provided to TVA upon request).

(2) Electrical service must be installed with an electrical disconnect that is:

(i) Located above the 500-year floodplain or the flood risk profile, whichever is higher, and

(ii) Is accessible during flood events.

(3) TVA's issuance of a permit does not mean that TVA has determined the facilities are safe for any purpose or that TVA has any duty to make such a determination.

(d) Fences crossing TVA residential access shoreland may be considered only where outstanding agricultural rights or fencing rights exist and the land is used for agricultural purposes. Fences must have a built-in means for easy pedestrian passage by the public and they must be clearly marked.
