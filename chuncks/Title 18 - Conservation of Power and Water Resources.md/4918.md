##### § 706.206 Support of Council programs.

(a) When a Council program is based on law or Executive order, every employee has a positive obligation to make it function as efficiently and economically as possible and to support it as long as it is a part of recognized public policy. An employee may, therefore, properly make an address explaining and interpreting such a program, citing its achievements, defending it against uninformed or unjust criticism, pointing out the need for possible improvements, or soliciting views for improving it.

(b) An employee shall not, either directly or indirectly, use appropriated funds to influence a Member of Congress to favor or oppose legislation in violation of 18 U.S.C. 1913. However, an employee is not prohibited from:

(1) Testifying as a representative of the Council on pending legislation proposals before congressional committees on request; provided, that the relevant provisions of the current OMB Circular A-14 ("Legislation Coordination and Clearance") are complied with; or

(2) Assisting congressional committees in drafting bills or reports on request, when it is clear that the employee is serving solely as a technical expert under the direction of committee leadership.
