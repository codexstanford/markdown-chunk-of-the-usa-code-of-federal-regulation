##### § 701.306 Special procedure: Medical records.

(a) An individual requesting disclosure of a record which contains medical or psychological information may name a medical doctor or other person to act as his agent as described in § 701.310(a). Records containing medical or psychological information may be disclosed to that agent rather than to the individual at the individual's request.

(b) If the individual has not named a medical doctor as agent, the Council may determine, after consultation with a medical doctor, that disclosure of the information would have an adverse effect on the requester. The Council may then disclose that information to a medical doctor specified by the individual, rather than to that individual, either in person or by mail.
