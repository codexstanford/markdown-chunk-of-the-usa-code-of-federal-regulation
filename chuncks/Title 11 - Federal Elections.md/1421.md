Under 26 U.S.C. 9008(b), the national committees of both major and minor parties are entitled to public funds to defray expenses incurred with respect to a Presidential Nominating convention. Under 26 U.S.C. 9008(d), expenditures with regard to such a convention by a national committee receiving public funds are limited to $4,000,000, as adjusted by the Consumer Price Index.
