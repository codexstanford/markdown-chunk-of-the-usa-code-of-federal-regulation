#### § 9409.1 Purpose and scope.

(a) This part sets forth policies and procedures you must follow when you submit a demand or request to an employee of the United States Election Assistance Commission to produce official records and information, or provide testimony relating to official information, in connection with a legal proceeding. You must comply with these requirements when you request the release or disclosure of official records and information.

(b) The Commission intends these provisions to:

(1) Promote economy and efficiency in its programs and operations;

(2) Minimize the possibility of involving the Commission in controversial issues not related to its functions;

(3) Maintain the Commission's impartiality among private litigants where the Commission is not a named party; and

(4) Protect sensitive, confidential information and the deliberative processes of the Commission.

(c) In providing for these requirements, the Commission does not waive the sovereign immunity of the United States.

(d) This part is intended only to provide guidance for the internal operations of the Commission and to inform the public about Commission procedures concerning the service of process and responses to demands or requests. The procedures specified in this part, or the failure of any Commission employee to follow the procedures specified in this part, are not intended to create, do not create, and may not be relied upon to create a right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States.
