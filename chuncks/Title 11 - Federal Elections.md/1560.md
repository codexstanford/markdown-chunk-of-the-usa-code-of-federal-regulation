#### PART 9034 - ENTITLEMENTS
##### § 9034.3 Non-matchable contributions.

A contribution to a candidate other than one which meets the requirements of 11 CFR 9034.2 is not matchable. Contributions which are not matchable include, for example:

(a) In-kind contributions of real or personal property;

(b) A subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money, or anything of value;

(c) A contract, promise, or agreement, whether or not legally enforceable, such as a pledge card to make a contribution for any such purposes (but a gift of money by written instrument is not rendered unmatchable solely because the contribution was preceded by a promise or pledge);

(f) Contributions in the form of a check drawn on the account of a committee, corporation, union or government contractor even though the funds represent personal funds earmarked by a contributing individual to a Presidential candidate;

(g) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for an item with significant intrinsic and enduring value, such as a watch;

(h) Contributions in the form of the purchase price paid for or other otherwise induced by a chance to participate in a raffle, lottery, or a similar drawing for valuable prizes;

(i) Contributions which are made by persons without the necessary donative intent to make a gift or made for any purpose other than to influence the result of a primary election;

(j) Contributions of currency of the United States or currency of any foreign country; and

(k) Contributions redesignated for a different election or redesignated for a legal and accounting compliance fund pursuant to 11 CFR 9003.3.
