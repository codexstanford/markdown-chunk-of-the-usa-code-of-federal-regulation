(b) If no additional information is required, within ten (10) days from receipt of the request, the Commission shall either make the requested correction or amendment or notify the individual of its refusal to do so, including in the notification the reasons for the refusal, and the appeal procedures provided in § 1.9.

(c) The Commission shall make each requested correction or amendment to a record if that correction or amendment will tend to negate inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete matter in the record.
