Except as provided in § 176.80 or § 176.90-

(a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by the Recovery Act may be used for a project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a public building or public work (see definitions at §§ 176.140 and 176.160) unless-

(1) The public building or public work is located in the United States; and
