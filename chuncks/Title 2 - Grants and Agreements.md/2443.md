###### § 1400.600 How does a DOI suspension or debarment action begin?

(a) Federal officials, DOI award officials, employees, or other sources will forward information indicating the potential existence of a cause for suspension or debarment, as listed in 2 CFR 180.700 and 180.800, to:

(1) The DOI Office of Inspector General Administrative Remedies Division (OIG ARD); or

(2) The Suspending and Debarring Official.

(b) If forwarded to the OIG ARD, that office will conduct a review to determine if a recommendation for administrative action is warranted. If warranted, the OIG ARD will prepare and submit to the Suspending and Debarring Official an Action Referral Memorandum (ARM) with supporting documentation for the administrative record.

(c) OIG ARD will also identify potential matters for case development and conduct a review to determine if a recommendation for administrative action is warranted. If warranted, the OIG ARD will prepare and submit to the Suspending and Debarring Official an ARM with supporting documentation for the administrative record.

(d) The Suspending and Debarring Official will review the ARM to determine the adequacy of evidence to support and initiate:

(1) A suspension by taking the actions listed in 2 CFR 180.615 and 180.715; or

(2) A debarment by taking the actions listed in 2 CFR 180.615 and 2 CFR 180.805; and

(3) Notification of the respondent on how the respondent may contest the action.
