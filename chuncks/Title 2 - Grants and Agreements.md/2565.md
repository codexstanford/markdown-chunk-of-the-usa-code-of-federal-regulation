###### Procurement Standards
####### § 1500.11 Use of the same architect or engineer during construction.

(a) If the recipient is satisfied with the qualifications and performance of the architect or engineer who provided any or all of the facilities planning or design services for a waste-water treatment works project and wishes to retain that firm or individual during construction of the project, it may do so without further public notice and evaluation of qualifications, provided:

(1) The recipient received a facilities planning (Step 1) or design grant (Step 2), and selected the architect or engineer in accordance with EPA's procurement regulations in effect when EPA awarded the grant; or

(2) The award official approves noncompetitive procurement under 2 CFR 200.320(c)(4) for reasons other than simply using the same individual or firm that provided facilities planning or design services for the project; or

(3) The recipient attests that:

(i) The initial request for proposals clearly stated the possibility that the firm or individual selected could be awarded a contract for services during construction; and

(ii) The firm or individual was selected for facilities planning or design services in accordance with procedures specified in this section.

(iii) No employee, officer or agent of the recipient, any member of their immediate families, or their partners have financial or other interest in the firm selected for award; and

(iv) None of the recipient's officers, employees or agents solicited or accepted gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors or other parties to contracts.

(b) However, if the recipient uses the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section to retain an architect or engineer, any Step 3 contracts between the architect or engineer and the grantee must meet all other procurement provisions in 2 CFR 200.317 through 200.327.
