During the time that federally owned property for which you are accountable under this award is used for the project or program supported by the award, you:

1. Also may make the property available for use on other federally supported projects or programs, but only if that use will not interfere with the property's use for the project or program supported by this award. You must give first priority to other projects or programs supported by DoD Components.

2. May use the property for purposes other than federally supported projects or programs only with the prior approval of the awarding office or, if you request approval after the award is made, the award administration office.
