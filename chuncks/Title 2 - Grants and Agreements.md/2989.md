## Subtitle B - Federal Agency Regulations for Grants and Agreements
### Chapter XXXVII - Peace Corps
#### PART 3700 - NONPROCUREMENT DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION
##### § 3700.220 What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?

Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), Peace Corps does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.
