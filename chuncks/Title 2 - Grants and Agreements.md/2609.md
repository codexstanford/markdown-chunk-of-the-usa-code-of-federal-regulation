###### § 1532.1305 What are the consequences if I mislead the EPA in seeking reinstatement or fail to comply with my administrative agreement?

(a) Any certification of correction issued by the EPA debarring official whether the certification results from a reinstatement decision under §§ 1532.1205(a) and 1532.1230, or from an administrative agreement under §§ 1532.1205(b) and 1532.1300, is conditioned upon the accuracy of the information, representations or assurances made during development of the administrative record.

(b) If the EPA debarring official finds that he or she has certified correction of the condition giving rise to a CAA or CWA conviction or violation on the basis of a false, misleading, incomplete or inaccurate information; or if a person fails to comply with material condition of an administrative agreement, the EPA debarring official may take suspension or debarment action against the person(s) responsible for the misinformation or noncompliance with the agreement as appropriate. If anyone provides false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading information to EPA in an attempt to obtain reinstatement, the EPA debarring official will refer the matter to the EPA Office of Inspector General for potential criminal or civil action.
