##### § 2701.112 Conflict of Interest.

The following conflict of interest policies apply to all SBA awards of financial assistance:

(a) Where an employee or contractor of a non-Federal entity providing assistance under an SBA award also provides services in exchange for pay in her or his private capacity, that employee or contractor may not accept as a client for her or his private services any individual or firm she or he assists under an SBA award.

(b) No non-Federal entity providing assistance under an SBA award (nor any subrecipient, employee, or contractor of such an entity) may give preferential treatment to any client referred to it by an organization with which it has a financial, business, or other relationship.

(c) Except where otherwise provided for by law, no non-Federal entity may seek or accept an equity stake in any firm it assists under the auspices of an SBA award. Additionally, no principal, officer, employee, or contractor of such an entity (nor any of their Close or Secondary Relatives as those terms are defined by 13 CFR 108.50) may seek or accept an equity stake or paid position in any firm the entity assists under an SBA award.
