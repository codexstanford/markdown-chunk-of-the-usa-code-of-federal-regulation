###### § 1400.635 May DOI settle a debarment or suspension action?

Under 2 CFR 180.635, the Suspending and Debarring Official may resolve a suspension or debarment action through an administrative agreement if it is in the best interest of the Government at any stage of proceedings, where the respondent agrees to appropriate terms. The specific effect of administrative agreements that incorporate terms regarding award eligibility will vary with the terms of the agreements. Where the Suspending and Debarring Official enters into an administrative agreement, PAM will notify the award officials by:

(a) Entering any appropriate information regarding an exclusion or the termination of an exclusion into the SAM; and

(b) Entering the agreement into the Federal Awardee Performance Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) or its successor system.
