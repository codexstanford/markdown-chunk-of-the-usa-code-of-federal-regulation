###### § 83.1 Purposes.

(a) The purposes of this part are (1) to effectuate the provisions of sections 799A and 845 of the Public Health Service Act, which forbid the extension of Federal support under title VII or VIII of that Act to any entity of the types described in those sections unless that entity submits to the Secretary of Health and Human Services an assurance satisfactory to the Secretary that it will not discriminate on the basis of sex in the admission of individuals to its training programs, and (2) to implement the policy of the Secretary that no Federal support will be extended under those titles to any other entity unless that entity submits to the Secretary an assurance satisfactory to the Secretary that it will not discriminate on the basis of sex in the admission of individuals to its training programs.

(b) The objective of this part is to abolish use of sex as a criterion in the admission of individuals to all training programs operated by an entity which receives support under title VII or VIII of the Act, and thereby to foster maximum use of all available human resources in meeting the Nation's needs for qualified health personnel.
