##### § 1705.8 Appeal of an initial adverse agency determination on correction or amendment of the record.

An individual who disagrees with the refusal of the System Manager to correct or to amend his or her record may submit a request for review of such refusal to the Chairman of the Commission, 1717 K Street NW., Suite 601, Washington, DC 20036. The Chairman will, not later than 30 days from the date on which the individual requests such review, complete such review and make a final determination unless, for good cause shown, the Chairman extends such 30-day period. If, after his or her review, the Chairman also refuses to correct or to amend the record in accordance with the request, the individual may file with the Commission a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of the Commission and may seek judicial review of the Chairman's determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A).
