(2) Written approval for an individual exception is granted by the Commissioner in accordance with § 73a.735-504; however, such approval will not be considered unless all of the following conditions are met:

(i) Retention of the financial interest does not give rise to an actual conflict of interest;

(ii) Acquisition of the financial interest occurred by marriage or inheritance, or the interest was held prior to an FDA reorganization, change in regulations, or similar circumstances beyond the control of the employee that resulted in the interest becoming prohibited;

(iii) No direct relationship exists between the employee's official duties and the regulated activities of the organization in which the financial interest is held;

(i) Occupies an FDA position classified at GS-11 or above, or PHS Commissioned Officer 0-3 or above, or equivalent;
