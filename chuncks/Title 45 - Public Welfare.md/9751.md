###### § 400.23 Hearings.

(a) A State must provide applicants for, and recipients of, assistance and services under the Act with an opportunity for a hearing to contest adverse determinations using hearing procedures set forth in § 205.10(a) of this title for public assistance programs unless otherwise specified in this part.

(b) If the issue is the date of entry into the United States of an applicant for or recipient of assistance or services, the State or its designee must provide for prompt resolution of the issue by inspection of the individual's documentation issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) or by information obtained from INS, rather than by hearing.
