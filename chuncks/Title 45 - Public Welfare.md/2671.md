(b) Upon receipt of the information, the Department will within 14 days take one of the following actions:

(1) Inform the State in writing that the request has been disapproved and the reason for disapproval; or

(2) Inform the State in a communication reflected in a record, that the Department recognizes that an emergency exists and that within 90 days from the date of the State's initial request, the State must submit a formal request for approval which includes the information specified at § 95.611 in order for the ADP equipment or services acquisition to be considered for the Department's approval.

(c) If the Department approves the request submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, FFP will be available from the date the State acquires the ADP equipment and services.
