###### § 286.200 How will we determine if Tribal Family Assistance Grant funds were misused or intentionally misused?

(a) We will use the single audit or Federal review or audit to determine if a Tribe should be penalized for misusing Tribal Family Assistance Grant funds under § 286.195(a)(1) or intentionally misusing Tribal Family Assistance Grant funds under § 286.195(a)(2).

(b) If a Tribe uses the TFAG in violation of the provisions of the Act, the provisions of 45 CFR part 75, or any Federal statutes and regulations applicable to the TANF program, we will consider the funds to have been misused.

(c) The Tribe must show, to our satisfaction, that it used the funds for purposes that a reasonable person would consider to be within the purposes of the TANF program (as specified at § 286.35) and the provisions listed in § 286.45.

(d) We will consider the TFAG to have been intentionally misused under the following conditions:

(1) There is supporting documentation, such as Federal guidance or policy instructions, indicating that TANF funds could not be used for that purpose; or

(2) After notification that we have determined such use to be improper, the Tribe continues to use the funds in the same or similarly improper manner.

(e) If the single audit determines that a Tribe misused Federal funds in applying the negotiated time limit provisions under § 286.115, the amount of the penalty for misuse will be limited to five percent of the TFAG amount.

(1) This penalty shall be in addition to the reduction specified under § 286.195(a)(1).

(2) [Reserved]
