###### General Provisions for Selected Items of Cost
####### § 75.425 Audit services.

(a) A reasonably proportionate share of the costs of audits required by, and performed in accordance with, the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), as implemented by requirements of this part, are allowable. However, the following audit costs are unallowable:

(1) Any costs when audits required by the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part-have not been conducted or have been conducted but not in accordance therewith; and

(2) Any costs of auditing a non-Federal entity that is exempted from having an audit conducted under the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part because its expenditures under Federal awards are less than $750,000 during the non-Federal entity's fiscal year.

(b) The costs of a financial statement audit of a non-Federal entity that does not currently have a Federal award may be included in the indirect cost pool for a cost allocation plan or indirect cost proposal.

(c) Pass-through entities may charge Federal awards for the cost of agreed-upon-procedures engagements to monitor subrecipients (in accordance with subpart D of this part, §§ 75.351 through 75.353) which are exempted from the requirements of the Single Audit Act and subpart F of this part. This cost is allowable only if the agreed-upon-procedures engagements are:

(1) Conducted in accordance with GAGAS attestation standards;

(2) Paid for and arranged by the pass-through entity; and

(3) Limited in scope to one or more of the following types of compliance requirements: activities allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost principles; eligibility; and reporting.
