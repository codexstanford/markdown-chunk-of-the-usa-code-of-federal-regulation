###### § 2516.310 May private school students participate?

(a) Yes. To the extent consistent with the number of students in the State or Indian tribe or in the school district of the LEA involved who are enrolled in private nonprofit elementary or secondary schools, the State, Indian tribe, or LEA must (after consultation with appropriate private school representatives) make provision-

(1) For the inclusion of services and arrangements for the benefit of those students so as to allow for the equitable participation of the students in the programs under this part; and

(2) For the training of the teachers of those students so as to allow for the equitable participation of those teachers in the programs under this part.

(b) If a State, Indian tribe, or LEA is prohibited by law from providing for the participation of students or teachers from private nonprofit schools as required by paragraph (a) of this section, or if the Corporation determines that a State, Indian tribe, or LEA substantially fails or is unwilling to provide for their participation on an equitable basis, the Corporation will waive those requirements and arrange for the provision of services to the students and teachers.
