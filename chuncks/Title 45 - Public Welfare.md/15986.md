###### § 2507.19 Circumstances in which fees may not be charged.

(a) If AmeriCorps fails to comply with the time limits for responding to a request, and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply to processing the request, it may not charge search fees (or, for requesters with preferred fee status, may not charge duplication fees).

(b) If AmeriCorps fails to comply with the extended time limit for unusual circumstances under § 2705.10(c), it may not charge search fees (or, for requesters with preferred fee status, may not charge duplication fees), except as follows:

(1) If unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, AmeriCorps may charge search fees (or, for requesters with preferred fee status, may charge duplication fees), so long as AmeriCorps has given the requester timely written notice and has discussed with the requester via email, telephone, or paper mail (or made at least three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could limit the scope of the request.

(2) If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, AmeriCorps' failure to comply with a time limit will be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

(c) AmeriCorps will charge search or review fees for a quarter-hour period only when more than half of that period is required for search or review.

(d) AmeriCorps will not charge any fee if the total fee calculated according to § 2507.18 is $25.00 or less for any request.
