##### § 2508.12 What are the contents of the systems of record that are to be maintained by the Corporation?

(a) The Corporation shall maintain all records that are used in making determinations about any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination;

(b) In situations in which the information may result in adverse determinations about such individual's rights, benefits and privileges under any Federal program, all information placed in a system of records shall, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected from the individual to whom the record pertains.

(c) Each form or other document that an individual is expected to complete in order to provide information for any system of records shall have appended thereto, or in the body of the document:

(1) An indication of the authority authorizing the solicitation of the information and whether the provision of the information is mandatory or voluntary.

(2) The purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used.

(3) Routine uses which may be made of the information and published pursuant to § 2508.6.

(4) The effect on the individual, if any, of not providing all or part of the required or requested information.

(d) Records maintained in any system of records used by the Corporation to make any determination about any individual shall be maintained with such accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the making of any determination about such individual, provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to update or keep current retired records.

(e) Before disseminating any record about any individual to any person other than an employee in the Corporation, unless the dissemination is made pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Corporation shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that such records are, or were at the time they were collected, accurate, complete, timely and relevant for Corporation purposes.

(f) Under no circumstances shall the Corporation maintain any record about any individual with respect to or describing how such individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained, or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.

(g) In the event any record is disclosed as a result of the order of a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the Corporation shall make reasonable efforts to notify the individual whose record was so disclosed after the process becomes a matter of public record.
