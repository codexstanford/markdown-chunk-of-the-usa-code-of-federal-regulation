##### § 9.4 Criteria.

(a) The official permitting use of Department facilities must determine that it would be consistent with the programs of his activity to participate.

Such requirements or procedures are to include the requirement to report to the permitting official any accident involving the non-Government user.

(c) The official delegated authority for approving the use of Department facilities will not permit the use of laboratory facilities unless he determines:

(1) That facilities are available for the period desired; and

(2) That the proposed research will not interfere with regular Department functions or needs, nor require the subsequent acquisition of additional equipment by the Department.
