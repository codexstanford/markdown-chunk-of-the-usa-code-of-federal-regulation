##### Subpart E - What Penalties Apply to States Related to Work Requirements?
###### § 261.52 Is there a way to waive the State's penalty for failing to achieve either of the participation rates?

(a) We will not impose a penalty under this part if we determine that the State has reasonable cause for its failure.

(b) In addition to the general reasonable cause criteria specified at § 262.5 of this chapter, a State may also submit a request for a reasonable cause exemption from the requirement to meet the minimum participation rate in two specific case situations.

(1) We will determine that a State has reasonable cause if it demonstrates that failure to meet the work participation rates is attributable to its provision of federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers (i.e., it provides evidence that it achieved the applicable work rates when individuals receiving federally recognized good cause domestic violence waivers of work requirements, in accordance with the provisions at §§ 260.54(b) and 260.55 of this chapter, are removed from the calculations in §§ 261.22(b) and 261.24(b)).

(2) We will determine that a State has reasonable cause if it demonstrates that its failure to meet the work participation rates is attributable to its provision of assistance to refugees in federally approved alternative projects under section 412(e)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522(e)(7)).

(c) In accordance with the procedures specified at § 262.4 of this chapter, a State may dispute our determination that it is subject to a penalty.
