####### Conclusion.,Example 8,Example 8

(B)The same terms requirement of paragraph (c)(3) of this section is satisfied in this paragraph (f)(1)(viii) () because full-time seasonal employees and full-time employees who are not seasonal employees may be considered different classes and Plan Sponsor G offers the HRA on the same terms to all full-time seasonal employees. The minimum class size requirement does not apply to the class offered the HRA in this paragraph (f)(1)(viii) () because part-time employees are not offered coverage and full-time employees are not an applicable class subject to the minimum class size requirement if part-time employees are not offered coverage.
