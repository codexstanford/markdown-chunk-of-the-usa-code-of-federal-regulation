When the period of time allowed is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays observed by the Federal government are excluded from the computation.

(b) The period of time for filing any responsive pleading or papers is determined by the date of receipt (as defined in § 156.901) of the submission to which a response is being made.

(c) The ALJ may grant extensions of the filing deadlines specified in these regulations or set by the ALJ for good cause shown (except that requests for extensions of time to file a request for hearing may be granted only on the grounds specified in § 156.905(b)).
