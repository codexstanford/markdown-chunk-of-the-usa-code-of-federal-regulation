An employee who has information which he or she reasonably believes indicates the existence of an activity constituting (a) a possible violation of a rule or regulation of the Department; or (b) mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, or abuse of authority; or (c) a substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety, shall immediately report such information to his or her supervisor, any management official of the Department, or directly to the Office of the Inspector General. Employees and supervisors should refer to chapter 5-10 of the Department's General Administration Manual for procedures regarding the reporting and handling of such information.
