(a) It iswithin the Department's jurisdiction to consider applications for waiver based on:

(1) Exceptional hardship to the exchange visitor's American or legally resident alien spouse or child; or

(2) The alien's unwillingness to return to the country of his/her nationality or last residence on the grounds that he/she or family members would be subject to persecution on account of race, religion or political opinion.

(b) Likewise, this Department is not responsible for considering requests to extend visas.

(c) Inquiries concerning the above should be directed to the District Office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service which has jurisdiction over the exchange visitor's place of residence in the United States.
