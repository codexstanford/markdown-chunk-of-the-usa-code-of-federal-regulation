###### § 2522.310 What are the application requirements for AmeriCorps educational awards only?

(a) Eligible applicants may apply for AmeriCorps educational awards only for one of the following eligible service positions: (1) A position for a participant in an AmeriCorps program that:

(i) Is carried out by an entity eligible to receive support under part 2521 of this chapter;

(ii) Would be eligible to receive assistance under this part, based on criteria established by the Corporation, but has not applied for such assistance;

(2) A position facilitating service-learning in a program described in parts 2515 through 2519 of this chapter;

(3) A position involving service as a crew leader in a youth corps program or a similar position supporting an AmeriCorps program; and

(4) Such other AmeriCorps positions as the Corporation considers to be appropriate.

(b) Because programs applying only for AmeriCorps educational awards must, by definition, meet the same basic requirements as other approved AmeriCorps programs, applicants must comply with the same application requirements specified in § 2522.300.
