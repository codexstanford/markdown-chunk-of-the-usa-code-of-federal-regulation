##### § 1201.4 Service of subpoenas, court orders, and other demands or requests for official information or action.

(a) Except in cases in which the Corporation is represented by legal counsel who have entered an appearance or otherwise given notice of their representation, only the General Counsel is authorized to receive and accept subpoenas, or other demands or requests directed to any component of the Corporation or Corporation Employees, whether civil or criminal in nature, for:

(1) Material, including documents, contained in the files of the Corporation;

(2) Information, including testimony, affidavits, declarations, admissions, response to interrogatories, or informal statements, relating to material contained in the files of the Corporation or which any Corporation employee acquired in the course and scope of the performance of official duties;

(3) Garnishment or attachment of compensation of Corporation Employees; or

(4) The performance or non-performance of any official Corporation duty.

(b) In the event that any subpoena, demand, or request is sought to be delivered to a Corporation Employee other than in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, such attempted service shall be ineffective. Such Corporation Employee shall, after consultation with the General Counsel, decline to accept the subpoena, and demand or request the return of it under cover of a written communication referring to the procedures prescribed in this part.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the Corporation is not an agent for service or otherwise authorized to accept on behalf of Corporation Employees any subpoenas, show-cause orders, or similar compulsory process of federal or state courts, or requests from private individuals or attorneys, which are not related to the employees' official duties except upon the express, written authorization of the individual Corporation Employee to whom such demand or request is directed.

(d) Acceptance of such documents by the General Counsel does not constitute a waiver of any defenses that might otherwise exist with respect to service under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure at 28 U.S.C. Appendix, Rules 4-6 or 18 USC Appendix or other applicable rules.
