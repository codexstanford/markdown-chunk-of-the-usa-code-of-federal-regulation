(2) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least three months and will not have been delinquent more than 10 years at the time the offset is made;

(3) With respect to which the Corporation has:

(i) Given the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable;

(ii) Considered evidence presented by the debtor; and

(iii) Determined that an amount of the debt is past due and legally enforceable;

(4) With respect to which the Corporation has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor that:

(i) The debt is past due, and

(ii) Unless repaid within 60 days of the date of the notice, the debt may be referred to the Treasury for offset against any refund of overpayment of tax; and

(5) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Treasury regulations relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset (31 CFR 285.2) have been satisfied.
