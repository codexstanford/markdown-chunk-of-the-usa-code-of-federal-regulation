(2) The request does not reasonably describe the records sought;

(3) A requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or is not in the Agency's possession and/or control; or

(4) A requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format you seek.

(b) The Agency denies a procedural benefit only, and not access to the underlying records, when it makes a decision that:

(2) Expedited processing will not be provided.

(c) The Agency must consult with legal counsel before it denies a fee waiver request or withholds all or part of a requested record.
