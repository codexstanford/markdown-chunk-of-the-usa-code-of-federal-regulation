Individuals eligible to apply for and hold James Madison Fellowships are United States citizens, United States nationals, or permanent residents of the Northern Mariana Islands who are:

(a) Teachers of American history, American government, social studies, or political science in grades 7-12 who:

(1) Are teaching full time during the year in which they apply for a fellowship;

(2) Are under contract, or can provide evidence of being under prospective contract, to teach full time as teachers of American history, American government, social studies, or political science in grades 7-12;

(3) Have demonstrated records of willingness to devote themselves to civic responsibilities and to professional and collegial activities within their schools and school districts;

(4) Are highly recommended by their department heads, school heads, school district superintendents, or other supervisors;

(5) Qualify for admission with graduate standing at accredited universities of their choice that offer master's degree programs allowing at least 12 semester hours or their equivalent of study of the origins, principles, and development of the Constitution of the United States and of its comparison with the constitutions of other forms of government;

(6) Are able to complete their proposed courses of graduate study within five calendar years from the commencement of study under their fellowships, normally through part-time study during summers or in evening or weekend programs;

(7) Agree to attend the Foundation's four-week Summer Institute on the Constitution, normally during the summer following the commencement of study under their fellowships; and

For the purposes of this provision, a full academic year of study is considered by the Foundation to be 18 credit hours or 27 quarter hours. Fellows' teaching obligations will be figured at full academic years of study; and when Fellows have studies for partial academic years, those years will be rounded upward to the nearest one-half year to determine Fellows' total teaching obligations.
