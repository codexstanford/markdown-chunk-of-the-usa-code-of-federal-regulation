(5) With respect to each requirement in § 309.65(a) that the Tribe or Tribal organization does not currently meet, a program development plan which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the Tribe or Tribal organization has the capacity and will have in place a Tribal IV-D program that will meet the requirements outlined in § 309.65(a), within a reasonable, specific period of time, not to exceed two years. The Secretary must approve the program development plan. Disapproval of a program development plan is not subject to administrative appeal.

(b) The process for approval and disapproval of applications for start-up funding under this section is found in §§ 309.35, 309.40, 309.45, and 309.50. A disapproval of an application for start-up funding is not subject to administrative appeal.

In extraordinary circumstances, the Secretary will consider a request to extend the period of time during which start-up funding will be available and/or to increase the amount of start-up funding provided. Denial of a request to extend the time during which start-up funding will be available or for an increase in the amount of start-up funding is not subject to administrative appeal.

(1) The Secretary may grant a no-cost extension of time if the Tribe or Tribal organization demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the extension will result in satisfaction of each requirement established in § 309.65(a) by the grantee and completion of the program development plan required under § 309.65(b)(2).

(2) The Secretary may grant an increase in the amount of Federal start-up funding provided beyond the limit specified at paragraph (c) of this section and § 309.150 if-

(ii) The Tribe or Tribal organization demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has satisfied every applicable reporting requirement.

(d) If a Tribe or Tribal organization receives start-up funding based on submission and approval of a Tribal IV-D application which includes a program development plan under § 309.65(b), a progress report that describes accomplishments to date in carrying out the plan must be submitted with the next annual refunding request.
