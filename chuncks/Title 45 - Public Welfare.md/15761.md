###### § 2400.65 Teaching obligation.

Upon receiving a Master's degree, each Fellow must teach American history, American government, social studies, or political science on a full-time basis to students in secondary school for a period of not less than one year for each academic year for which financial assistance was received. Each Fellow will be required to provide the Foundation with an annual certification from an official of the secondary school where the Fellow is employed indicating the teaching activities of the Fellow during the past year. This same certification will be required each year until the Fellow's teaching obligation is completed. Any teaching done by the Fellow prior to or during graduate studies does not count towards meeting this teaching obligation.
