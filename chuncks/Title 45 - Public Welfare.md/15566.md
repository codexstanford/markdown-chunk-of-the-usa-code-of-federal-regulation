###### § 2105.23 What if the requested records contain both exempt and nonexempt material?

If responsive records contain both exempt and nonexempt material, the Agency will consult with legal counsel, as discussed in § 2105.21(c). After consultation, the Agency will partially grant and partially deny the request by:

(a) Segregating and releasing the nonexempt information, unless the nonexempt material is so intertwined with the exempt material that disclosure of it would leave only meaningless words and phrases;

(b) Indicating on the released portion of the record the amount of information deleted and the FOIA exemption under which the deletion was made, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the FOIA exemption used to withhold the information; and

(c) If technically feasible, indicating the amount of information deleted and the FOIA exemption under which the deletion was made at the place in the record where the deletion was made.
