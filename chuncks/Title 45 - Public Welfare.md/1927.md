###### § 83.4 Coverage.

(a) If an entity receives Federal support for any of its training programs, all of its training programs thereby become subject to this part.

(b) The obligation imposed by this part on a federally supported entity not to discriminate on the basis of sex in the admission of individuals to a training program includes not only the obligation not to discriminate on such basis in the selection of individuals for such program, but also the obligation not to discriminate on such basis against individuals after their selection for such program.

(c) The obligation imposed by this part on a federally supported entity not to discriminate on the basis of sex against an individual who is an applicant for, or is enrolled in, a training program is applicable to the same extent to the actions of such entity with respect to an applicant for, or a student enrolled in, an undergraduate program of education of such entity if individuals enrolled in such program must complete all or a part of such programs to be eligible for admission to an undergraduate training program of such entity.

(d) An entity shall not discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of this part for as long as such entity receives or benefits from Federal support. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an entity shall be deemed to continue to receive or benefit from Federal support for as long as it retains ownership, possession, or use of either real or personal property and which was acquired in whole or in part with Federal support. If an entity receives value for property which was acquired in whole or in part with Federal support and such value is applied toward the acquisition of other property, such entity shall be deemed to continue to receive or benefit from such support for as long as such entity retains ownership, use, or possession of such other property.

(e) An entity shall not transfer property which was acquired, constructed, altered, repaired, expanded, or renovated in whole or in part with Federal support unless the agency, organization, or individual to whom such property is to be transferred has submitted to the Director, and he or she has found satisfactory, an assurance of compliance with this part. The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to any real or personal property for which payments have been recaptured by the United States under title VII or VIII of the Act, with respect to any other property for which the transferring entity has refunded to the Federal Government the Federal share of the fair market value of such property, or with respect to any personal property which has only scrap value to both the entity and the agency, organization or individual to which the property is to be transferred.
