#### PART 284 - METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING WHETHER AN INCREASE IN A STATE OR TERRITORY'S CHILD POVERTY RATE IS THE RESULT OF THE TANF PROGRAM
##### § 284.45 What are the contents and duration of the corrective action plan?

(a) The State must include in the corrective action plan:

(1) An outline of the manner in which the State or Territory will reduce its child poverty rate;

(2) A description of the actions it will take under the plan; and

(3) Any actions to be taken under the plan by the Indian tribe(s) (or Tribal consortia) operating a TANF program in the State.

(b) The State must implement the corrective action plan until it determines and notifies us that its child poverty rate, as determined in § 284.20, is less than the lowest child poverty rate on the basis of which the State was required to submit the corrective action plan. The "lowest child poverty rate" means the five percent threshold above the first year in the two-year comparison period.
