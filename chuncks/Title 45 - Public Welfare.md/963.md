These conditions, which apply to outside teaching and lecturing (including giving single addresses such as commencement and Memorial Day speeches) whether or not done for compensation, are:

(2) Government travel or per diem funds are not used for the sole purpose of obtaining or performing such teaching or lecturing;

(3) Such teaching or lecturing is not dependent on specific information which would not otherwise be available to the public;

(4) Teaching, lecturing, or writing may not be for the purpose of the special preparation of a person or class of persons for an examination of the Office of Personnel Management or Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service, that depends on information obtained as a result of the employee's Government employment, except when that information has been made available to the general public or will be made available on request;

(5) Such activities do not involve knowingly instructing persons on dealing with particular matters pending before Government organizations with which the employee is associated in an official capacity;

(6) Advance approval is obtained when required by paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Advance approval. Advance approval must be obtained in accordance with § 73.735-708 of this subpart before an employee may:

(2) Use, for teaching or lecturing purposes, clinical case records or other material of a confidential nature or to which access is limited for persons outside the Government. Such use will not be permitted unless made under safeguards established by the operating component to retain the confidentiality of the material, and such use is determined to be in the public interest.
