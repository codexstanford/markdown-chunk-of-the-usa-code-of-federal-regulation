##### § 617.15 Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

(a) A complainant may file a civil action after exhausting administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are exhausted if:

(1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed a sufficient complaint and NSF has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or

(2) NSF issues any finding in favor of the recipient.

(b) If NSF fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a finding in favor of the recipient, NSF will:

(1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact; and

(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil action for injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. 6104; and

(3) Inform the complainant that under 42 U.S.C. 6104:

(i) The complainant may bring a civil action only in a United States District court for the district in which the recipient is located or transacts business;

(ii) A complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;

(iii) Before commencing the action the complainant shall give 30 days notice by registered mail to the Director, the Attorney General of the United States, and the recipient;

(iv) The notice must state the alleged violation of the Act; the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the action; and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

(v) The complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.
