#### PART 212 - ASSISTANCE FOR UNITED STATES CITIZENS RETURNED FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES
##### § 212.7 Repayment to the United States.

(a) An individual who has received temporary assistance shall be required to repay, in accordance with his ability, any or all of the cost of such assistance to the United States, except insofar as it is determined that:

(1) The cost is not readily allocable to such individual;

(2) The probable recovery would be uneconomical or otherwise impractical;

(3) He does not have, and is not expected within a reasonable time to have, income and financial resources sufficient for more than ordinary needs; or

(4) Recovery would be against equity and good conscience.

(b) In determining an individual's resources, any claim which he has against any individual, trust or estate, partnership, corporation, or government shall be considered, and assignment to the United States of such claims shall be taken in appropriate cases.

(c) A determination that an individual is not required to repay the cost of temporary assistance shall be final and binding, unless such determination was procured by fraud or misrepresentation of the individual or some other person, or the individual voluntarily offers to repay.

(d) A determination that an individual is required to repay any or all of the cost of temporary assistance may be reconsidered at any time prior to repayment of the required amount. A further determination shall be made with respect to his liability to repay the balance of such amount on the basis of new evidence as to whether (1) he has, or is expected within a reasonable time to have, income and financial resources sufficient for more than ordinary needs, or (2) recovery would be against equity and good conscience.
