###### § 2105.8 What if your request seeks records about another person?

(a) When a request seeks records about another person, you may receive greater access by submitting proof that the person either:

(1) Consents to the release of the records to you (for example, a notarized authorization signed by that person); or

(2) Is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary).

(b) The Agency can require you to supply additional information if necessary to verify that a particular person has consented to disclosure or is deceased.
