####### § 1156.21 Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

(a) A complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are exhausted if:

(1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and the Endowment has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or

(2) The Endowment issues a finding in favor of the recipient.

(b) If the Endowment fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a finding in favor of the recipient, the Endowment will:

(1) Promptly advise the complainant if either of the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section has been met;

(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring a civil action for injunctive relief that will effect the purpose of the Act;

(3) Inform the complainant:

(i) That the complainant may bring a civil action only in the United States district court for the district in which the recipient is located or transacts business;

(ii) That a complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;

(iii) That before commencing the action the complainant shall give 30 days notice by registered mail to the Chairperson of the Endowment, the Secretary, the Attorney General of the United States, and the recipient;

(iv) That the notice must state: the alleged violation of the Act; the relief requested; the court in which the complainant is bringing the action; and whether or not the attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and

(v) That the complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.
