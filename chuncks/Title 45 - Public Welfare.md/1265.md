###### Performance and Financial Monitoring and Reporting
####### § 75.341 Financial reporting.

Unless otherwise approved by OMB, the HHS awarding agency may solicit only the standard, OMB-approved government-wide data elements for collection of financial information (at time of publication the Federal Financial Report or such future collections as may be approved by OMB and listed on the OMB Web site). This information must be collected with the frequency required by the terms and conditions of the Federal award, but no less frequently than annually nor more frequently than quarterly except in unusual circumstances, for example where more frequent reporting is necessary for the effective monitoring of the Federal award or could significantly affect program outcomes, and preferably in coordination with performance reporting.
