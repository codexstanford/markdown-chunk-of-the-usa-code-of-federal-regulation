###### § 670.31 Specific issuance criteria for imports.

Subject to compliance with other applicable law, any person who takes a native mammal, bird, plant or invertebrate under a permit issued under the regulations in this part may import it into the United States unless the Director finds that the importation would not further the purpose for which it was taken. If the importation is for a purpose other than that for which the native mammal, bird, plant or invertebrate was taken, the Director may permit importation upon a finding that importation would be consistent with the purposes of the Act, the regulations in this part, or the permit under which they were taken.
