###### § 263.1 How much State money must a State expend annually to meet the basic MOE requirement?

(a)(1) The minimum basic MOE for a fiscal year is 80 percent of a State's historic State expenditures.

(2) However, if a State meets the minimum work participation rate requirements in a fiscal year, as required under §§ 261.21 and 261.23 of this chapter, after adjustment for any caseload reduction credit under § 261.41 of this chapter, then the minimum basic MOE for that fiscal year is 75 percent of the State's historic State expenditures.

(3) A State that does not meet the minimum participation rate requirements in a fiscal year, as required under §§ 261.21 and 261.23 of this chapter (after adjustment for any caseload reduction credit under § 261.41 of this chapter), but which is granted full or partial penalty relief for that fiscal year, must still meet the minimum basic MOE specified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(b) The basic MOE level also depends on whether a Tribe or consortium of Tribes residing in a State has received approval to operate its own TANF program. The State's basic MOE level for a fiscal year will be reduced by the same percentage as we reduced the SFAG as the result of any Tribal Family Assistance Grants awarded to Tribal grantees in the State for that year.
