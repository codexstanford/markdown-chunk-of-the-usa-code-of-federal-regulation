###### § 98.63 Allotments from the Matching Fund.

(a) To each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia there is allocated an amount equal to its share of the total available under section 418(a)(3) of the Social Security Act. That amount is based on the same ratio as the number of children under age 13 residing in the State bears to the national total of children under age 13. The number of children under 13 is derived from the best data available to the Secretary for the second preceding fiscal year.

(b) For purposes of this section, the amounts available under section 418(a)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 618(a)(3)) excludes the amounts reserved and allocated under § 98.60(b)(1) for technical assistance, research and evaluation, and the national toll-free hotline and Web site and under § 98.62(a) and (b) for the Mandatory Fund.

(c) Amounts under this section are available pursuant to the requirements at § 98.55(c).
