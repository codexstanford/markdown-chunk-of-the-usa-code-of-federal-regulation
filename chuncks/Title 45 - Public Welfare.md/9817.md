###### Applications, Determinations of Eligibility, and Furnishing Assistance
####### § 400.93 Opportunity to apply for medical assistance.

(a) A State must provide any individual wishing to do so an opportunity to apply for medical assistance and must determine the eligibility of each applicant.

(b) In determining eligibility for medical assistance, the State agency must comply with regulations governing applications, determinations of eligibility, and furnishing Medicaid (including the opportunity for fair hearings) in the States and the District of Columbia under 42 CFR part 435, subpart J, and in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands under 42 CFR part 436, subpart J, and 42 CFR part 431, subpart E.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the State must notify promptly the agency (or local affiliate) which provided for the initial resettlement of a refugee whenever the refugee applies for medical assistance.

(d) In providing notice to an applicant or recipient to indicate that assistance has been authorized or that it has been denied or terminated, the State must specify the program(s) to which the notice applies, clearly distinguishing between refugee medical assistance and Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). For example, if a refugee applies for assistance, is determined ineligible for Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) but eligible for refugee medical assistance, the notice must specify clearly the determinations with respect both to Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) and to refugee medical assistance.
