An actor's practice that is likely to interfere with the access, exchange, or use of electronic health information in order to protect the security of electronic health information will not be considered information blocking when the practice meets the conditions in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, and in addition meets either the condition in paragraph (d) of this section or the condition in paragraph (e) of this section.
