###### § 286.85 How will we calculate the work participation rates?

(a) Work participation rate(s) will be the percentage of families with an adult or minor head-of-household receiving TANF assistance from the Tribe who are participating in a work activity approved in the TFAP for at least the minimum number of hours approved in the TFAP.

(b) The participation rate for a fiscal year is the average of the Tribe's participation rate for each month in the fiscal year.

(c) A Tribe's participation rate for a month is expressed as the following ratio:

(1) The number of families receiving TANF assistance that include an adult or a minor head-of-household who is participating in activities for the month (numerator), divided by

(2) The number of families that include an adult or a minor head-of-household receiving TANF assistance during the month excluding:

(i) Families that were penalized for non-compliance with the work requirements in that month as long as they have not been sanctioned for more than three months (whether or not consecutively) out of the last 12 months; and

(ii) Families with children under age one, if the Tribe chooses to exempt these families from participation requirements.

(d) If a family receives assistance for only part of a month or begins participating in activities during the month, the Tribe may count it as a month of participation if an adult or minor head-of-household in the family is participating for the minimum average number of hours in each full week that the family receives assistance or participates in that month.

(e) Two-parent families in which one of the parents is disabled are considered one-parent families for the purpose of calculating a Tribe's participation rate.
