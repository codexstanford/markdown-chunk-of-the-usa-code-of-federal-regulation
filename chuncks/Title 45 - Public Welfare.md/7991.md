###### § 170.570 Effect of revocation on the certifications issued to Complete EHRs and EHR Module(s).

(a) The certified status of Health IT Module(s) certified by an ONC-ACB or tested by an ONC-ATL that had its status revoked will remain intact unless a Type-1 violation was committed by the ONC-ACB and/or ONC-ATL that calls into question the legitimacy of the certifications issued.

(b) If the National Coordinator determines that a Type-1 violation was committed by an ONC-ACB and/or ONC-ATL that called into question the legitimacy of certifications issued to health IT, then the National Coordinator would:

(1) Review the facts surrounding the revocation of the ONC-ACB's or ONC-ATL's status; and

(2) Publish a notice on ONC's Web site if the National Coordinator believes that the Health IT Module(s) certifications were based on unreliable testing and/or certification.

(c) If the National Coordinator determines that Health IT Module(s) certifications were based on unreliable testing and/or certification, the certification status of affected Health IT Module(s) would only remain intact for 120 days after the National Coordinator publishes the notice.

(1) The certification status of affected Health IT Module(s) can only be maintained after the 120-day timeframe by being re-tested by an ONC-ATL in good standing, as necessary, and re-certified by an ONC-ACB in good standing.

(2) The National Coordinator may extend the time that the certification status of affected Health IT Module(s) remains intact as necessary for the proper retesting and recertification of the affected health IT.
