(a)(1) Not more than five percent of the grant funds provided under 45 CFR 2516, 2517, 2519, and 2521 for any fiscal year may be used to pay for administrative costs, as defined in § 2510.20 of this chapter.

(A) Organizations that have an established indirect cost rate for Federal awards will be limited to this method; and

(B) Unreimbursed indirect costs may be applied to meeting operational matching requirements under the Corporation's award;

(ii) Specify that a fixed rate of five percent or less (not subject to supporting cost documentation) of total Corporation funds expended may be used to pay for administrative costs, provided that the fixed rate is in conjunction with an overall 15 percent administrative cost factor to be used for organizations that do not have established indirect cost rates; or

(iii) Utilize such other method that the Corporation determines in writing is consistent with OMB guidance and other applicable requirements, helps minimize the burden on grantees or subgrantees, and is beneficial to grantees or subgrantees and the Federal Government.

(b) Costs attributable to administrative functions as well as program functions should be prorated between administrative costs and program costs.
