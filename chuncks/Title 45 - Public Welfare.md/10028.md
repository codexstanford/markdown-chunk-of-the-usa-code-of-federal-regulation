###### § 411.71 ORR monitoring and evaluation of care provider facilities following an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual harassment.

(a) Upon receiving an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual harassment that occurs at an ORR care provider facility, ORR will monitor and evaluate the care provider facility to ensure that the care provider facility complied with the requirements of this section or ORR policies and procedures. Upon conclusion of an outside investigation, ORR must review any available completed investigation reports to determine whether additional monitoring and evaluation activities are required.

(b) ORR must develop written policies and procedures for incident monitoring and evaluation of sexual abuse and sexual harassment allegations, including provision requiring:

(1) Reviewing prior complaints and reports of sexual abuse and sexual harassment involving the suspected perpetrator;

(2) Determining whether actions or failures to act at the care provider facility contributed to the abuse or harassment;

(3) Determining if any ORR policies and procedures or relevant legal authorities were broken; and

(4) Retention of such reports for as long as the alleged abuser or harasser is in ORR custody or employed by ORR or the care provider facility, plus ten years.

(c) ORR must ensure that its incident monitoring and evaluation does not interfere with any ongoing investigation conducted by State or local Child Protective Services, the State or local licensing agency, or law enforcement.

(d) When outside agencies investigate an allegation of sexual abuse or sexual harassment, the care provider facility and ORR must cooperate with outside investigators.
