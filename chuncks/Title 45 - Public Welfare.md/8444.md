###### a,b,c

(vii) If the State agency establishes policy under which assistance from other agencies and organizations will not be deducted in determining the amount of assistance to be paid, provide that no duplication shall exist between such other assistance and that provided by the public assistance agency. In such complementary program relationships, nonduplication shall be assured by provision that such aid will be considered in relation to: () The different purpose for which the other agency grants aid such as vocational rehabilitation; () the provision of goods and services that are not included in the statewide standard of the public assistance agency, e.g., a private agency might provide money for special training for a child or for medical care when the public assistance agency does not carry this responsibility; or housing and urban development payments might be provided to cover moving expenses that are not included in the assistance standard; or () the fact that public assistance funds are insufficient to meet the total amount of money determined to be needed in accordance with the statewide standard. In such instances, grants by other agencies in an amount sufficient to make it possible for the individual to have the amount of money determined to be needed, in accordance with the public assistance agency standard, will not constitute duplication.

(viii) Provide that: (A) Payment will be based on the determination of the amount of assistance needed; (B) if full individual payments are precluded by maximums or insufficient funds, adjustments will be made by methods applied uniformly statewide; (C) in the case of AFDC no payment of aid shall be made to an assistance unit in any month in which the amount of aid prior to any adjustments is determined to be less than $10; and (D) an individual who is denied aid because of the limitation specified in (C) of this section, or because the payment amount is determined to be zero as a result of rounding the payment amount as required by § 233.20(a)(2)(iv), shall be deemed a recipient of aid for all other purposes except participation in the Community Work Experience Program.

(ix) Provide that the agency will establish and carry out policies with reference to applicants' and recipients' potential sources of income that can be developed to a state of availability.

(x) Provide that the income and resources of individuals receiving SSI benefits under title XVI, individuals with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom State or local foster care payments are made, individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made, or individuals with respect to whom State or local adoption assistance payments are made, for the period for which such benefits or payments are received, shall not be counted as income and resources of an assistance unit applying for or receiving assistance under title IV-A; except that a child receiving adoption assistance payments will not be excluded if such exclusion would cause the AFDC benefits of the assistance unit of which the child would otherwise be considered a member to be reduced. Under this requirement, "individuals receiving SSI benefits under title XVI" include individuals receiving mandatory or optional State supplementary payments under section 1616(a) of the Social Security Act or under section 212 of Public Law 93-66 and, "individuals with respect to whom Federal foster care payments are made" means a child with respect to whom Federal foster care maintenance payments are made under section 472(b) and defined in section 475(4)(A) of the Act, and a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by foster care maintenance payments made with respect to his or her minor parent under sections 472(h) and 475(4)(B) of the Act. "Individuals with respect to whom Federal adoption assistance payments are made" means a child who receives payments made under an approved title IV-E plan based on an adoption assistance agreement between the State and the adoptive parents of a child with special needs, pursuant to sections 473 and 475(3) of the Social Security Act.

(xii) In the case of AFDC if the State chooses to count the value of the governmental rent or housing subsidies as income, provide that the State plan shall:

(A) Identify the amount for shelter included in its need and payment standards for an assistance unit of the same size and composition. (States which have a flat grant system must estimate this amount based on historical data or some other justifiable procedure.); and

(B) Specify the amount of such housing assistance that it will count as income. Under this requirement, the amount of such rent or housing subsidies which a State may count as income may not exceed the amount for shelter established in its payment standard for assistance unit of the same size and composition.

(xiii) Under the AFDC plan, provide that no assistance unit is eligible for aid in any month in which the unit's income (other than the assistance payment) exceeds 185 percent of the State's need standard (including special needs) for a family of the same composition (including special needs), without application of the disregards in paragraph (a)(11)(i) (except to the extent provided for under paragraph (a)(3)(xix)), paragraph (a)(11)(ii) and paragraph (a)(11)(viii) of this section.

This disregarded amount shall equal the State's need standard amount for a family group of the same composition as the stepparent and those other individuals described in the preceding sentence;

(C) Amounts actually paid by the stepparent to individuals not living in the home but who are or could be claimed by him or her as dependents for purposes of determining his or her Federal personal income tax liability; and

(xviii) For AFDC, in the case of a dependent child whose parent is a minor under the age of 18 (without regard to school attendance), the State shall count as income to the assistance unit the income, after appropriate disregards, of such minor's own parent(s) living in the same household as the minor and dependent child. The disregards to be applied are the same as are applied to the income of a stepparent pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(xiv) of this section. However, in applying the disregards, each employed parent will receive the benefit of the work expense disregard in paragraph (a)(3)(xiv)(A) of this section.

For purposes of this paragraph, a loan is considered bona fide when it meets objective and reasonable criteria included in the State plan.
