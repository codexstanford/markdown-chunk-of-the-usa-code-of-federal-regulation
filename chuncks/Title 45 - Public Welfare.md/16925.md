###### § 2554.36 Can a party informally discuss the case with the ALJ?

No. Such discussions are forbidden as "ex parte communications" with the ALJ. No party or person (except employees of the ALJ's office) shall communicate in any way with the ALJ on any matter at issue in a case, unless on notice and opportunity for all parties to participate.

This does not prohibit a person or party from inquiring about the status of a case or asking routine questions concerning administrative functions or procedures.
