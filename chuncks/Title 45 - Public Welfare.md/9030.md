#### PART 283 - IMPLEMENTATION OF SECTION 403(A)(2) OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT BONUS TO REWARD DECREASE IN ILLEGITIMACY RATIO
##### § 283.7 How will we use these data on abortions to determine bonus eligibility?

(a) For those States that have met all the requirements under §§ 283.1 through 283.6, we will calculate the rate of abortions for calendar year 1995 and for the most recent year for which abortion data are available as defined in § 283.2. These rates will equal the number of abortions reported by the State to ACF for the applicable year, divided by total live births among women living in the State reported by NCHS for the same year. We will calculate the rates to three decimal places.

(b) If ACF determines that the State's rate of abortions for the most recent year for which abortion data are available is less than the rate for 1995, and, if the State has met all the requirements listed elsewhere under this part, the State will receive the bonus.
