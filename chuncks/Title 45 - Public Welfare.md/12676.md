(a) Unless excepted by DOJ, NEH will complete the CCLR (see § 1177.21(b)), accompanied by a signed Certificate of Indebtedness, to refer all administratively uncollectible claims to DOJ for litigation.

(b) NEH will indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions it wishes DOJ to take with respect to the referred claim. The CCLR permits NEH to indicate specifically any of a number of litigative activities which DOJ may pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew judgment lien only, renew judgment lien and enforce collection, program enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and efficiency judgment.

(c) NEH also will use the CCLR to refer claims to DOJ to obtain approval of any proposals to compromise the claims or to suspend or terminate NEH collection activity.
