###### § 2105.28 How and when may a submitter object to the disclosure of confidential information?
####### see

(a) If a submitter has any objections to the disclosure of confidential information, the submitter should provide a detailed written statement to the Agency that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any FOIA exemption (§ 2105.29 for further discussion of Exemption 4 objection statements).

(b) A submitter who does not respond within the time period specified under § 2105.26(d) will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Responses received by the Agency after this time period will not be considered by the Agency unless the appropriate Agency FOIA contact determines, in his or her sole discretion, that good cause exists to accept the late response.
