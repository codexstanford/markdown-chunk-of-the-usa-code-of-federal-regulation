###### § 260.70 What is the purpose of this subpart?

(a) Under section 415 of the Act, if a State was granted a waiver under section 1115 of the Act and that waiver was in effect on August 22, 1996, the amendments made by PRWORA do not apply for the period of the waiver, to the extent that they are inconsistent with the waiver and the State elects to continue its waiver.

(b) Identification of waiver inconsistencies is relevant for the determination of penalties in three areas:

(1) Under § 261.50 of this chapter for failing to meet the work participation rates at part 261 of this chapter;

(2) Under § 264.2 of this chapter for failing to comply with the five-year limit on Federal assistance at subpart A of part 264 of this chapter; and

(3) Under § 261.54 of this chapter for failing to impose sanctions on individuals who fail to work.

(c) This subpart explains how we will determine waiver inconsistencies and apply them in the penalty determination process for these penalties.
