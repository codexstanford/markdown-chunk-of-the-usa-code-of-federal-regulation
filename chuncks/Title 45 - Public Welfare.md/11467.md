(d) If the employee files a petition for a hearing later than the 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the Notice of Offset, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the hearing official may accept the request if the employee can show that there was good cause (such as due to circumstances beyond his or her control or because he or she was not informed or aware of the time limit) for failing to meet the deadline date.

(e) An employee will not be granted a hearing and will have his or her disposable pay offset in accordance with the Deputy Staff Director's offset schedule if he or she fails to show good cause why he or she failed to file the petition for a hearing within the stated time limits.
