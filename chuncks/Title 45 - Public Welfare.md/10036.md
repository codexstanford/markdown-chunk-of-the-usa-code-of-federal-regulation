###### § 411.101 Sexual abuse and sexual harassment incident reviews.

(a) Care provider facilities must conduct sexual abuse or sexual harassment incident reviews at the conclusion of every investigation of sexual abuse or sexual harassment and, where the allegation was either substantiated or unable to be substantiated but not determined to be unfounded, prepare a written report recommending whether the incident review and/or investigation indicates that a change in policy or practice could better prevent, detect, or respond to sexual abuse and sexual harassment. The care provider facility must implement the recommendations for improvement or must document its reason for not doing so in a written response. Both the report and response must be forwarded to ORR's Prevention of Sexual Abuse Coordinator. Care provider facilities also must collect accurate, uniform data for every reported incident of sexual abuse and sexual harassment using a standardized instrument and set of definitions.

(b) Care provider facilities must conduct an annual review of all sexual abuse and sexual harassment investigations and resulting incident reviews to assess and improve sexual abuse and sexual harassment detection, prevention, and response efforts. The results and findings of the annual review must be provided to ORR's Prevention of Sexual Abuse Coordinator.
