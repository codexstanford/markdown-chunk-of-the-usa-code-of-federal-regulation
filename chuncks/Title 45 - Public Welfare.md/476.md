###### § 30.24 Joint and several liability.

(a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, the Secretary will pursue collection against all debtors, as appropriate. The Secretary will not attempt to allocate the burden of payment between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible.

(b) The Secretary will ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does not automatically release the Department's claim against the remaining debtor(s). The amount of a compromise with one debtor shall not be considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount that will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.
