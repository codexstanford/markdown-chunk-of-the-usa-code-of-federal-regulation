###### § 2105.41 What review fees will you have to pay?

(a) The Agency will charge review fees if you make a commercial-use request, subject to the restrictions of §§ 2105.35(f), 2105.37, and 2105.38(a).

(b) The Agency will assess review fees in connection with the initial review of the record (the review conducted by the Agency to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record).

(c) The Agency will not charge for reviews at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if the appellate authority determines that an exemption no longer applies, any costs associated with the Agency's re-review of the records to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees.

(d) The Agency will charge review fees at the same rates as those charged for a search under § 2105.39(b).

(e) The Agency can charge review fees even if the record(s) reviewed ultimately is not disclosed.
