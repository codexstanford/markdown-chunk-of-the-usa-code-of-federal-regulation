An individual who disagrees with the refusal of the Deputy Executive Secretary of the Foundation to correct or to amend his or her record may submit a request for a review of such refusal to the Executive Secretary, Harry S. Truman Scholarship Foundation, 712 Jackson Place, NW., Washington, DC 20006. The Executive Secretary will, not later than thirty working days from the date on which the individual requests such review, complete such review and make a final determination unless, for good cause shown, the Executive Secretary extends such thirty day period.
