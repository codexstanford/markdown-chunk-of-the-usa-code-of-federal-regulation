###### § 96.127 Requirements regarding tuberculosis.

(a) States shall require any entity receiving amounts from the grant for operating a program of treatment for substance abuse to follow procedures developed by the principal agency of a State for substance abuse, in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance Abuse Services, and in cooperation with the State Department of Health/Tuberculosis Control Officer, which address how the program-

(1) Will, directly or through arrangements with other public or nonprofit private entities, routinely make available tuberculosis services as defined in § 96.121 to each individual receiving treatment for such abuse;

(2) In the case of an individual in need of such treatment who is denied admission to the program on the basis of the lack of the capacity of the program to admit the individual, will refer the individual to another provider of tuberculosis services; and

(3) Will implement infection control procedures established by the principal agency of a State for substance abuse, in cooperation with the State Department of Health/Tuberculosis Control Officer, which are designed to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis, including the following:

(i) Screening of patients;

(ii) Identification of those individuals who are at high risk of becoming infected; and

(iii) Meeting all State reporting requirements while adhering to Federal and State confidentiality requirements, including 42 CFR part 2; and

(4) will conduct case management activities to ensure that individuals receive such services.

(b) The State shall develop effective strategies for monitoring programs compliance with this section. States shall report under the requirements of § 96.122(g) on the specific strategies to be used to identify compliance problems and corrective actions to be taken to address those problems. The principal agency, in cooperation with the State Department of Health/Tuberculosis Control Officer, shall also establish linkages with other health care providers to ensure that tuberculosis services are routinely made available. All individuals identified with active tuberculosis shall be reported to the appropriate State official as required by law and consistent with paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.

(c) With respect to services provided for by a State for purposes of compliance with this section, the State shall maintain Statewide expenditures of non-Federal amounts for such services at a level that is not less than an average level of such expenditures maintained by the State for the 2-year period preceding the first fiscal year for which the State receives such a grant. In making this determination, States shall establish a reasonable funding base for fiscal year 1993. The base shall be calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the composition of the base shall be applied consistently from year to year.
