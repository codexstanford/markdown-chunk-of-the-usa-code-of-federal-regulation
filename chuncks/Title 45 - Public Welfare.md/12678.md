####### § 1177.36 Minimum amount of referrals to the Department of Justice.

(a) NEH will not refer to DOJ for litigation any claims of less than $2,500, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or such other amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe. DOJ will promptly notify NEH if the Attorney General changes this minimum amount.

(b) NEH will not refer claims of less than the minimum amount unless:

(1) Litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure compliance with NEH's policies or programs;

(2) NEH is referring the claim solely for the purpose of securing a judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to NEH for enforcement; or

(3) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the Government can effectively enforce payment, with due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under state and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government.

(c) NEH will consult with the Executive Office for United States Attorneys' Financial Litigation Staff at the DOJ prior to referring claims valued at less than the minimum amount.
