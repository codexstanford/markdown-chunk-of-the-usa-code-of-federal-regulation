###### § 75.101 Applicability.
####### Federal award of cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR to a non-Federal entity.

(2)When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract, only subpart D of this part §§ 75.351 through 75.353 (in addition to any FAR related requirements for subaward monitoring), subpart E of this part and subpart F of this part are incorporated by reference into the contract. However, when the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract, they take precedence over the requirements of this part except for subpart F of this part when they are in conflict. In addition, costs that are made unallowable under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) as described in the FAR subpart 31.2 and subpart 31.603 are always unallowable.

(3) With the exception of subpart F of this part, which is required by the Single Audit Act, in any circumstances where the provisions of Federal statutes or regulations differ from the provisions of this part, the provision of the Federal statutes or regulations govern.
