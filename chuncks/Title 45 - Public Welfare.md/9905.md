##### § 401.12 Cuban and Haitian entrant cash and medical assistance.

Except as may be otherwise provided in this section, cash and medical assistance shall be provided to Cuban and Haitian entrants by the same agencies, under the same conditions, and to the same extent as such assistance is provided to refugees under part 400 of this title.

(a) For purposes of determining the eligibility of Cuban and Haitian entrants for cash and medical assistance under this section and the amount of assistance for which they are eligible under this section, the same standards and criteria shall be applied as are applied in the determination of eligibility for an amount of cash and medical assistance for refugees under subparts E and G of part 400 of this title.

(b) Federal reimbursement will be provided to States for the costs of providing cash and medical assistance (and related administrative costs) to Cuban and Haitian entrants according to procedures and requirements, including procedures and requirements relating to the submission and approval of a State plan, identical to those applicable to the Refugee Program and set forth in part 400 of this title.

(c) The number of months during which an entrant may be eligible for cash and medical assistance for which Federal reimbursement is available under this section shall be counted starting with the first month in which an individual meeting the definition of a Cuban and Haitian entrant in § 401.2 was first issued documentation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service indicating:

(1) That the entrant has been granted parole by the Attorney General under the Immigration and Nationality Act,

(2) That the entrant is in a voluntary departure status, or

(3) That the entrant's residence in a United States community is known to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

The amendments are to be issued under the authority contained in section 412(a)(9), Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1522(a)(9)).
