CNCS shall:

(a) Ensure all effective guidance documents, identified by a unique identifier which includes, at a minimum, the document's title and date of issuance or revision and its RIN, if applicable, are on its website in a single, searchable, indexed database, and available to the public in accordance with § 2905.16;

(b) Note on its website that guidance documents lack the force and effect of law, except as authorized by law or as incorporated into a contract; and
