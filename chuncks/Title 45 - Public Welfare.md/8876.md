###### § 263.12 How will we determine if a State intentionally misused Federal TANF funds?

(a) The State must show, to our satisfaction, that it used these funds for purposes that a reasonable person would consider to be within the purposes of the TANF program (as specified at § 260.20 of this chapter) and consistent with the provisions listed in § 263.11.

(b) We may determine that a State misused funds intentionally if there is supporting documentation, such as Federal guidance or policy instructions, precluding the use of Federal TANF funds for such purpose.

(c) We may also determine that a State intentionally misused funds if the State continues to use the funds in the same or similarly improper manner after receiving notification that we had determined such use to be improper.
