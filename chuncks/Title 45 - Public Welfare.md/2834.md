###### § 96.128 Requirements regarding human immunodeficiency virus.

(a) In the case of a designated State as described in paragraph (b) of this section, the State shall do the following-

(1) with respect to individuals undergoing treatment for substance abuse, the State shall, subject to paragraph (c) of this section, carry out one or more projects to make available to the individuals early intervention services for HIV disease as defined in § 96.121 at the sites at which the individuals are undergoing such treatment;

(2) for the purpose of providing such early intervention services through such projects, the State shall make available from the grant the amounts prescribed by section 1924 of the PHS Act;

(3) the State shall, subject to paragraph (d) of this section, carry out such projects only in geographic areas of the State that have the greatest need for the projects;

(4) the State shall require programs participating in the project to establish linkages with a comprehensive community resource network of related health and social services organizations to ensure a wide-based knowledge of the availability of these services; and

(5) the State shall require any entity receiving amounts from the Block Grant for operating a substance abuse treatment program to follow procedures developed by the principal agency of a State for substance abuse, in consultation with the State Medical Director for Substance Abuse Services, and in cooperation with the State Department of Health/Communicable Disease Officer.

(b) For purposes of this section, a "designated State" is any State whose rate of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is 10 or more such cases per 100,000 individuals (as indicated by the number of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control for the most recent calendar year for which the data are available).

(c) With respect to programs that provide treatment services for substance abuse, the State shall ensure that each such program participating in a project under paragraph (a) of this section will be a program that began operation prior to the fiscal year for which the State is applying to receive the grant. A program that so began operation may participate in a project under paragraph (a) of this section without regard to whether the program has been providing early intervention services for HIV disease.

(d) If the State plans to carry out 2 or more projects under paragraph (a) of this section, the State shall carry out one such project in a rural area of the State, unless the requirement is waived. The Secretary shall waive the requirement if the State certifies to the Secretary that:

(1) The rate of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is less than or equal to two such cases per 100,000 individuals in any rural area of the State, or there are so few infected persons that establishing a project in the area is not reasonable; or

(2) There are no rural areas in the State as defined in § 96.121.

(e) With respect to the provision of early intervention services for HIV disease to an individual, the State shall ensure that the entities comply with § 96.137 regarding payment and § 96.135 regarding restrictions on expenditure of grant. The State shall also ensure that such services will be undertaken voluntarily by, and with the informed consent of, the individual, and undergoing such services will not be required as a condition of receiving treatment services for substance abuse or any other services.

(f) With respect to services provided for a State for purposes of compliance with this section, the State shall maintain Statewide expenditures of non-Federal amounts for such services at a level that is not less than the average level of such expenditures maintained by the State for 2-year period preceding the first fiscal year for which the State receives such a grant. In making this determination, States shall establish a reasonable base for fiscal year 1993. The base shall be calculated using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and the composition of the base shall be applied consistently from year to year.
