###### § 1356.67 Procedures for the transfer of placement and care responsibility of a child from a State to a Tribal title IV-E agency or an Indian Tribe with a title IV-E agreement.

(a) Each State with a title IV-E plan approved under section 471 of the Act must establish and maintain procedures, in consultation with Indian Tribes, for the transfer of responsibility for the placement and care of a child under a State title IV-E plan to a Tribal title IV-E agency or an Indian Tribe with a title IV-E agreement in a way that does not affect a child's eligibility for, or payment of, title IV-E and the child's eligibility for medical assistance under title XIX of the Act.

(b) The procedures must, at a minimum, provide for the State to:

(1) Determine, if the eligibility determination is not already completed, the child's eligibility under section 472 or 473 of the Act at the time of the transfer of placement and care responsibility of a child to a Tribal title IV-E agency or an Indian Tribe with a title IV-E agreement.

(2) Provide essential documents and information necessary to continue a child's eligibility under title IV-E and Medicaid programs under title XIX to the Tribal title IV-E agency, including, but not limited to providing:

(i) All judicial determinations to the effect that continuation in the home from which the child was removed would be contrary to the welfare of the child and that reasonable efforts described in section 471(a)(15) of the Act have been made;

(ii) Other documentation the State has that relates to the child's title IV-E eligibility under sections 472 and 473 of the Act;

(iii) Information and documentation available to the agency regarding the child's eligibility or potential eligibility for other Federal benefits;

(iv) The case plan developed pursuant to section 475(1) of the Act, including health and education records of the child pursuant to section 475(1)(C) of the Act; and
