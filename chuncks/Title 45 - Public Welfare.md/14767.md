##### § 1604.7 Court appointments.

(a) A recipient's written policies may permit a full-time attorney to accept a court appointment if the director of the recipient or the director's designee determines that:

(1) Such an appointment is consistent with the recipient's primary responsibility to provide legal assistance to eligible clients in civil matters;

(2) The appointment is made and the attorney will receive compensation for the court appointment under the same terms and conditions as are applied generally to attorneys practicing in the court where the appointment is made; and

(3) Subject to the applicable law and rules of professional responsibility, the attorney agrees to remit to the recipient any compensation received.

(b) A recipient's written policies may permit a full-time attorney to use program resources to undertake representation pursuant to a court appointment.

(c) A recipient's written policies may permit a full-time attorney to identify the recipient as his or her employer when engaged in representation pursuant to a court appointment.

(d) If, under the applicable State or local court rules or practices or rules of professional responsibility, legal services attorneys are mandated to provide pro bono legal assistance in addition to the attorneys' work on behalf of the recipient's clients, the recipient's written policies shall treat such legal assistance in the same manner as court appointments under paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3), (b) and (c) of this section, provided that the policies may only permit mandatory pro bono activities that are not otherwise prohibited by the LSC Act, applicable appropriations laws, or LSC regulation.
