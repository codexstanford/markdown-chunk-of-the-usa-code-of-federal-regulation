The regulations in this part set forth NEH's procedures under the Privacy Act, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(f), with respect to systems of records maintained by NEH. These regulations establish procedures by which an individual may exercise the rights granted by the Privacy Act to determine whether an NEH system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her; gain access to such records; and request correction or amendment of such records. The regulations also set identification requirements; establish procedures by which an individual may appeal within NEH an adverse agency determination; prescribe fees which NEH will charge for copying records; and establish exemptions from certain requirements of the Privacy Act for certain NEH systems of records or parts thereof.
