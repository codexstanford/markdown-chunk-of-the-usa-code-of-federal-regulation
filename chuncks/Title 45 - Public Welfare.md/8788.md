Section 402(a)(7) of the Act provides that States electing the FVO certify that they have established and are enforcing standards and procedures to:

(a) Screen and identify individuals receiving TANF and MOE assistance with a history of domestic violence, while maintaining the confidentiality of such individuals;

(b) Refer such individuals to counseling and supportive services; and

(c) Provide waivers, pursuant to a determination of good cause, of normal program requirements to such individuals for so long as necessary in cases where compliance would make it more difficult for such individuals to escape domestic violence or unfairly penalize those who are or have been victimized by such violence or who are at risk of further domestic violence.
