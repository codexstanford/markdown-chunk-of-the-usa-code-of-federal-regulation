###### § 264.73 What is an annual reconciliation?

(a) The annual reconciliation involves the calculation, for a fiscal year, of:

(1) The amount of a State's qualifying expenditures;

(2) The amount by which a State's countable State expenditures, as defined in § 264.0, exceed the State's required Contingency Fund MOE level; and

(3) The amount of contingency funds that the State may retain or must remit.

(b) If a State exceeded its required Contingency Fund MOE level, it may be able to retain some or all of the contingency funds that it received.

(c) A State determines the amount of contingency funds that it may retain by performing the following calculations:

(1) From the lesser of the following two amounts:

(i) The amount of contingency funds paid to it during the fiscal year; or

(ii) Its countable State expenditures, as defined in § 264.0, minus its required Contingency Fund MOE level, multiplied by:

(A) The State's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) applicable for the fiscal year for which funds were awarded; and

(B)times the number of months during the fiscal year for which the State received contingency funds.

(2) Subtract the State's proportionate remittance (as reported to the State by ACF) for the overall adjustment of the Contingency Fund for that fiscal year required by section 403(b)(6)(C) of the Act.
