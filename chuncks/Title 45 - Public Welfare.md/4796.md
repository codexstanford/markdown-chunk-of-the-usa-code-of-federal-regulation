###### § 150.425 Motions.

(a) Any request to the ALJ for an order or ruling must be by motion, stating the relief sought, the authority relied upon, and the facts alleged. All motions must be in writing, with a copy served on the opposing party, except in either of the following situations:

(1) The motion is presented during an oral proceeding before an ALJ at which both parties have the opportunity to be present.

(2) An extension of time is being requested by agreement of the parties or with waiver of objections by the opposing party.

(b) Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, any response or opposition to a motion must be filed within 20 days of the party's receipt of the motion. The ALJ does not rule on a motion before the time for filing a response to the motion has expired except where the response is filed at an earlier date, where the opposing party consents to the motion being granted, or where the ALJ determines that the motion should be denied.
