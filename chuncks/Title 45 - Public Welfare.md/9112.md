###### § 286.25 How will we resolve disagreements over the State-submitted data used to determine the amount of a Tribal Family Assistance Grant?

(a) If a Tribe disagrees with the data submitted by a State, the Tribe may submit additional relevant information to the Secretary. Relevant information may include, but is not limited to, Census Bureau data, data from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, data from other Federal programs, and Tribal records.

(1) The Tribe must submit any relevant information within 45 days from the date it notifies the Secretary of its disagreement with State submitted data under § 286.20(b).

(2) We will review the additional relevant information submitted by the Tribe, together with the State-submitted data, in order to make a determination as to the amount of the TFAG. We will determine the amount of the TFAG at the earliest possible date after consideration of all relevant data.
