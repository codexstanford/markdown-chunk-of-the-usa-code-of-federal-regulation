######## § 102-75.970 How long is the landholding agency responsible for the expense of protection and maintenance of excess and surplus real property pending its transfer or disposal?

Generally, the landholding agency is responsible for the cost of protection and maintenance of excess or surplus property until the property is transferred or disposed, but not more than 15 months. However, the landholding agency is responsible for providing and funding protection and maintenance during any delay beyond that 15 month period, if the landholding agency-

(a) Requests deferral of the disposal beyond the 15 month period;

(b) Continues to occupy the property beyond the 15 month period to the detriment of orderly disposal; or

(c) Otherwise takes actions that result in a delay in the disposition beyond the 15 months.
