All regulations, orders, or like directions heretofore issued by any officer of GSA which imposed requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this subpart 101-6.2 applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this subpart, except that nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this subpart.
