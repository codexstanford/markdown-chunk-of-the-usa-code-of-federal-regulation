####### § 102-40.235 How do we handle motor vehicles not suitable for highway use?

Refer to subpart H of part 102-34 of this subchapter for the general policies regarding disposal of motor vehicles. Some Government-owned motor vehicles might receive such extensive damage as a result of an accident, event or other activity, that they are no longer suitable for utilization, donation, or sale for highway use. Such vehicles may only be donated or sold for salvage or scrap. Prior to disposal of damaged motor vehicles, you must evaluate known damage to determine their suitability for continued highway use. When a determination is made that a vehicle is unfit for continued highway use, you must include such information in the property record and subsequent reports. When selling such vehicles, provide an appropriate warning statement in the solicitation regarding vehicle condition that the vehicle cannot be titled for highway use. See § 102-34.305 of this subchapter (note to § 102-34.305(a)(2)) if the vehicle is not designed or not legal for operation on highways.
