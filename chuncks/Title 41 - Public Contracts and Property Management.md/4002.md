###### Subpart C - Business Rules To Consider Before Shipping Freight or Household Goods
####### § 102-117.100 What business rules must I consider before acquiring transportation or related services?

When acquiring transportation or related services you must:

(a) Use the mode or individual transportation service provider (TSP) that provides the overall best value to the agency. For more information, see §§ 102-117.105 through 102-117.130;

(b) Demonstrate no preferential treatment to any TSP when arranging for transportation services except on international shipments. Preference on international shipments must be given to United States registered commercial vessels and aircraft;

(c) Ensure that small businesses receive equal opportunity to compete for all business they can perform to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the agency's interest (see 48 CFR part 19);

(d) Encourage minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses, to compete for all business they can perform to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the agency's interest (see 48 CFR part 19);

(e) Review the need for insurance. Generally, the Government is self-insured; however, there are instances when the Government will purchase insurance coverage for Government property. An example may be cargo insurance for international air cargo shipments to cover losses over those allowed under the International Air Transport Association (IATA) or for ocean freight shipments; and

(f) Consider the added requirements on international transportation found in subpart D of this part.
