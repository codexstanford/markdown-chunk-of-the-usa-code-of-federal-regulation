##### § 51-11.6 Filing requirements for demands for documents or testimony.

Compliance with the following requirements is required when issuing demands or requests for official records, information or testimony.

(a) Requests must be in writing and must be submitted to the General Counsel. If a subpoena is served on the Committee or a Committee employee before submitting a written request and receiving a final determination, the Committee will object to the subpoena on grounds that it was not submitted in accordance with this part.

(b) Written requests must contain the following information:

(1) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved;

(2) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the assertions in the case and any other pleading or document necessary to show the relevance of the information sought;

(3) A detailed description of how the information sought is relevant to the issues in the legal proceeding, and a specific description of the substance of the testimony or records sought;

(4) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs the need to maintain any confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on the Committee to produce the records or provide testimony;

(5) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than a Committee employee, such as a retained expert;

(6) If testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony, a general summary of the desired testimony, and a showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony;

(7) A description of all prior decisions, orders, or pending motions in the case that bear upon the relevance of the requested records or testimony;

(8) The name, address, and telephone number of counsel to each party in the case; and

(9) An estimate of the amount of time that the requester and other parties will require with each Committee employee for time spent by the employee to prepare for testimony, in travel, and for attendance at the legal proceeding.

(c) The Committee reserves the right to require additional information to complete any request where appropriate.

(d) Requests should be submitted at least 45 calendar days before the date that records or testimony is required. Requests submitted in less than 45 calendar days before records or testimony is required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request and the reasons for expedited processing.

(e) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with the request.
