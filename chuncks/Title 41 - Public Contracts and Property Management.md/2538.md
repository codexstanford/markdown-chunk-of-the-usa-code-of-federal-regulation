######## § 102-36.260 How do we promote the expeditious transfer of excess personal property?

For expeditious transfer of excess personal property you should:

(a) Provide complete and accurate property descriptions and condition codes on the report of excess to facilitate the selection of usable property by potential users.

(b) Ensure that any available operating manual, parts list, diagram, maintenance log, or other instructional publication is made available with the property at the time of transfer.

(c) Advise the designated recipient of any special requirements for dismantling, shipping/transportation.

(d) When the excess personal property is located at a facility due to be closed, provide advance notice of the scheduled date of closing, and ensure there is sufficient time for screening and removal of property.
