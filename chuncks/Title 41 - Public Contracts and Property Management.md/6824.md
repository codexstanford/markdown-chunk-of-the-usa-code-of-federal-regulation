(a) The current schedule of closing costs which applies to the area in which you are buying or selling;

(b) Information concerning local custom and practices with respect to charging of closing costs which relate to either your sale or purchase and whether such costs are customarily paid by the seller or purchaser; and

(c) Information on the local terminology used to describe the costs specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
