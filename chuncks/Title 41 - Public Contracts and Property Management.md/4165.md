####### Agency Requirements for a Transportation Prepayment Audit Program
######## § 102-118.270 Must my agency establish a transportation prepayment audit program, and how is it funded?

(a) Yes, under 31 U.S.C. 3726, your agency is required to establish a transportation prepayment audit program. Your agency's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) must approve the prepayment audit program.

(b) Your agency must pay for the prepayment audit program from those funds appropriated for transportation services.

(1) Agencies are encouraged to consider using a GSA Transportation Audits Division approved third party electronic payment processor for transportation invoice processing, payment, and prepayment audit. These electronic payment processors are no cost to the agency and are fully compliant with GSA Transportation Audits Division prepayment audit requirements.

(2) Use of these third party payment processors generally means your agency will not have to provide any additional prepayment or postpayment documentation to GSA Transportation Audits Division.
