(a) System managers will establish administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of records, protect the records against possible threats or hazards, and permit access only to authorized persons. Automated systems will incorporate security controls such as password protection, verification of identity of authorized users, detection of break-in attempts, firewalls, or encryption, as appropriate.

(b) System managers will ensure that employees and contractors who have access to personal information in their system will have the proper background investigation and meet all privacy training requirements.
