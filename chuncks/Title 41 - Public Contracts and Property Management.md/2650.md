####### Disposing of Undistributed Property
######## § 102-37.290 What must a SASP do with surplus property it cannot donate?

(a) As soon as it becomes clear that you cannot donate the surplus property, you should first determine whether or not the property is usable.

(1) If you determine that the undistributed surplus property is not usable, you should seek GSA approval to abandon or destroy the property in accordance with § 102-37.320.

(2) If you determine that the undistributed surplus property is usable, you should immediately offer it to other SASPs. If other SASPs cannot use the property, you should promptly report it to GSA for redisposal (i.e., disposition through retransfer, sale, or other means).

(b) Normally, any property not donated within a 1-year period should be processed in this manner.
