####### Price Preference for Historic Properties
######## § 102-73.120 How much of a price preference must Federal agencies give when acquiring leased space using the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process?

Federal agencies must give a price evaluation preference to space in historic properties as follows:

(a) First to suitable historic properties within historic districts, a 10 percent price preference.

(b) If no suitable historic property within an historic district is offered, or the 10 percent preference does not result in such property being the lowest price technically acceptable offer, the Government will give a 2.5 percent price preference to suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts.

(c) If no suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped site within an historic district is offered, or the 2.5 percent preference does not result in such property being the lowest price technically acceptable offer, the Government will give a 10 percent price preference to suitable historic properties outside of historic districts.

(d) Finally, if no suitable historic property outside of historic districts is offered, no historic price preference will be given to any property offered.
