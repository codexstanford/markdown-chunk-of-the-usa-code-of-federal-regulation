####### § 109-43.307-52 Nuclear-related or proliferation-sensitive personal property.

(a) Recognizing that property disposal officials will not have the technical knowledge to identify nuclear-related and proliferation-sensitive personal property, all such personal property shall be physically tagged with a certification signed by an authorized program official at time of determination by the program office of the personal property as excess. Such an authorized official should be designated in writing with signature cards on file in the property office.

(b) Nuclear-related and proliferation-sensitive personal property which is excess to DOE needs shall be stripped of all characteristics which cause it to be nuclear-related or proliferation-sensitive personal property, as determined by the cognizant program office, prior to disposal. The cognizant program office shall certify that appropriate actions have been taken to strip the personal property as required, or shall provide the property disposal office with adequate instructions for stripping the items. Such action shall be accomplished in a manner which will preserve, so far as practicable, any civilian utility or commercial value of the personal property.
