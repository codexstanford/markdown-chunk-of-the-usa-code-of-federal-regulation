######## § 102-73.140 When may agencies that do not possess independent leasing authority lease space?

Federal agencies may perform for themselves all functions necessary to acquire leased space in buildings and land incidental thereto when-

(a) The authority may be delegated (see § 102-72.30) on the different types of delegations related to real estate leasing);

(b) The space may be leased for no rental, or for a nominal consideration of $1 per annum, and is limited to terms not to exceed 1 year;

(c) Authority has been requested by an Executive agency and a specific delegation has been granted by the Administrator of General Services;

(d) A categorical delegation has been granted by the Administrator of General Services for space to accommodate particular types of agency activities, such as military recruiting offices or space for certain county level agricultural activities (see § 102-73.155 for a listing of categorical delegations); or

(e) The required space is found by the Administrator of General Services to be wholly or predominantly utilized for the special purposes of the agency to occupy such space and is not generally suitable for use by other agencies. Federal agencies must obtain prior approval from the GSA regional office having jurisdiction for the proposed leasing action, before initiating a leasing action involving 2,500 or more square feet of such special purpose space. GSA's approval must be based upon a finding that there is no vacant Government-owned or leased space available that will meet the agency's requirements. Agency special purpose space delegations can be found in §§ 102-73.170 through 102-73.225.
