####### § 102-81.10 What basic physical security policy governs Federal agencies?

The Interagency Security Committee (ISC) is responsible for developing and evaluating physical security standards for nonmilitary Federal facilities. In accordance with E.O. 12977, the ISC sets policies and recommendations that govern physical security at Federal facilities and on Federal grounds occupied by Federal employees for nonmilitary activities. This includes the ISC Risk Management Process Standard (the RMP Standard) that Federal agencies use in the protection of the real property they occupy, including the protection of persons on the property. The goal of the RMP Standard is a level of protection commensurate with the level of risk. ISC policies do not supersede other laws, regulations, and Executive orders that are intended to protect unique assets.
