#### PART 60-4 - CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTORS - AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS
##### § 60-4.4 Affirmative action requirements.

(a) To implement the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246 in the construction industry, the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs previously has approved affirmative action programs commonly referred to as "Hometown Plans," has promulgated affirmative action plans referred to as "Imposed Plans" and has approved "Special Bid Conditions" for high impact projects constructed in areas not covered by a Hometown or an Imposed Plan. All solicitations for construction contracts made after the effective date of the regulations in this part shall include the notice specified in § 60-4.2 of this part and the specifications in § 60-4.3 of this part in lieu of the Hometown and Imposed Plans including the Philadelphia Plan and Special Bid Conditions. Until the Director has issued an order pursuant to § 60-4.6 of this part establishing goals and timetables for minorities in the appropriate geographical areas or for a project covered by Special Bid Conditions, the goals and timetables for minorities to be inserted in the Notice required by 41 CFR 60-4.2 shall be the goals and timetables contained in the Hometown Plan, Imposed Plan or Special Bid Conditions presently covering the respective geographical area or project involved.

(b) Signatories to a Hometown Plan (including heavy highway affirmative action plans) shall have 45 days from the effective date of the regulations in this part to submit under such a Plan (for the director's approval) goals and timetables for women and to include female representation on the Hometown Plan Administrative Committee. Such goals for female representation shall be at least as high as the goals established for female representation in the notice issued pursuant to 41 CFR 60-4.6. Failure of the signatories, within the 45-day period, to include female representation and to submit goals for women or a new plan, as appropriate, shall result in an automatic termination of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program's approval of the Hometown Plan. At any time the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs terminates or withdraws its approval of a Hometown Plan, or when the plan expires and another plan is not approved, the contractors signatory to the plan shall be covered automatically by the specifications set forth in § 60-4.3 of this part and by the goals and timetables established for that geographical area pursuant to § 60-4.6 of this part.
