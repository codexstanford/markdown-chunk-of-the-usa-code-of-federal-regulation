####### § 101-25.110 Tire identification/registration program.

The regulations issued by the Department of Transportation in 49 CFR part 574, Tire Identification and Recordkeeping, require that tire manufacturers maintain or have maintained for them the name and address of tire purchasers, the identification number of each tire sold, and the name and address of the tire seller (or other means by which the manufacturer can identify the tire seller). In addition, distributors and dealers are required to furnish such data to manufacturers in connection with purchases made directly from them. GSA provides support to the Federal Government for tires, and therefore has prescribed the following procedures for tires purchased from or through GSA supply sources.
