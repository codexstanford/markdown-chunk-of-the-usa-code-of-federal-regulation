####### § 101-25.101-3 Supply through consolidated purchase for direct delivery to use points.

The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item can be most advantageously supplied through consolidated purchase for direct delivery to use points:

(a) The items shall be equipment or supply items of such a character that it is feasible to forecast requirements for delivery to specific use points; and

(b) Conditions exist where any of the following factors requires consolidated purchasing of such items for direct delivery to use points-

(1) Where greatest price advantage, both direct and indirect costs considered, is obtainable through large definite quantity purchasing.

(2) Where an item is of special manufacture or design and is not readily available from commercial sources.

(3) Where market conditions are such that central procurement is required to assure adequate supply.

(4) Where contracts for production quantities are necessary to secure timely deliveries and advantageous prices.

(5) Where the quantity is large enough to assure lowest transportation costs or, conversely, where transportation costs for small quantity redistribution are so excessive that it is not feasible to store and issue the items.
