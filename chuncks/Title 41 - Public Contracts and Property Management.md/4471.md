##### Subpart 105-54.1 - General Provisions
###### § 105-54.103 Policy.

The basic GSA policy on committee management is as follows:

(a) Advisory committees will be formed or used by GSA only when specifically authorized by law, or by the President, or specifically determined as a matter of formal record by the Administrator of General Services to be in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed on GSA by law;

(b) Advisory committees will not be used to administer a function that is the assigned responsibility of a service or staff office;

(c) The assigned responsibility of a GSA official may not be delegated to any committee;

(d) No advisory committee may be used for functions that are not solely advisory unless specifically authorized by statute or Presidential directive. Making policy decisions and determining action to be taken with respect to any matter considered by an advisory committee is solely the responsibility of GSA; and

(e) In carrying out its responsibilities, GSA will consult with and obtain the advice of interested groups substantially affected by its programs. The use of advisory committees for this purpose is considered to be in the public interest and necessary for the proper performance by GSA of its assigned functions.
