####### § 101-30.102 Objectives.

The objectives of the Federal cataloging program are:

(a) To provide for the maintenance of a uniform Federal supply catalog system and the conversion to and exclusive use of this system by all Federal agencies.

(b) To name, describe, identify, classify, and number each item of personal property to be included in the Federal Catalog System so that the same items will have a single Federal item identification within and among the organizational elements of all Federal agencies.

(c) To collect, maintain, and publish such Federal catalog data and related supply management data as may be determined necessary or desirable to reflect such benefits to supply management as:

(1) Assistance in standardization of supplies and equipment;

(2) Disclosure of interchangeability and substitutability of items;

(3) Reduction in inventories of stock and increased rates of turnover;

(4) Increase in vendor competition and broader sources of supply;

(5) Provision of data for determining the most effective and economical method of item management on a Federal agency systemwide basis;

(6) Enhance item entry control;

(7) Facilitation of better interagency and intra-agency use of supplies, equipment, and excess stocks, and more exact identification of surplus personal property; and

(8) Assistance in providing precise statistics for budget and financial accounting purposes.
