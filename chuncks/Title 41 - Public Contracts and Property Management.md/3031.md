(a) You must maintain records of unclaimed personal property retained for official use for 3 years after title vests in the Government to permit identification of the property should the former owner file a claim for the property. You must also deposit funds received from disposal of such property in a special account to cover any valid claim filed within this 3-year period.

(b) When you no longer need the unclaimed property which you have placed in official use, report it as excess in the same manner as other excess property under part 102-36 of this subchapter B.
