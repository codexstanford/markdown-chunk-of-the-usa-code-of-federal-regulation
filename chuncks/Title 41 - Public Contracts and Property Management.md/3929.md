##### PART 102-85 - PRICING POLICY FOR OCCUPANCY IN GSA SPACE
###### Subpart D - Rent Charges
####### § 102-85.145 When are customer agencies responsible for Rent charges?

(a) When a customer agency occupies cancelable space, it is responsible for Rent charges until:

(1) The date of release specified in the OA, or until the date space is actually vacated, whichever occurs later; or

(2) Four months after having provided GSA written notice of release; or

(3) The date space is actually vacated, whenever occupancy extends beyond the date agreed upon under either paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

(b) When a customer agency releases non-cancelable space, it is responsible for all attributable Rent and other space charges until the OA expires. This responsibility is mitigated to the extent that GSA is able to assign the space to another user or dispose of it. (See § 102-85.65 How does an OA obligate the customer agency?)

(c) When a customer agency commits to occupy space in an OA or other binding document, but never occupies that space, that agency is responsible for:

(1) Non-cancelable space: Rent payments due for the space until the OA expires, unless GSA can mitigate; or

(2) All other space: Either GSA's space charges for 4 months plus the cost of tenant improvements or GSA's actual costs, whichever is less.
