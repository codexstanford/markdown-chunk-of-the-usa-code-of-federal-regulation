####### § 101-28.306-2 Use of customer supply centers.

(a) Orders are received by the CSC via phone, mail, electronic mail, or in person on a walk-in basis for urgent agency requirements. All use of the CSC is based upon the customer access code assigned at the time of establishment of the activity account. The customer access code determines the ship-to point for orders placed with the CSC. The ship-to point cannot be changed, one established, except by the submission of a written request signed by an appropriate agency official.

(b) All orders placed with the CSC, except emergency pickup orders, described in § 101-28.306-1(c), will be shipped to the activity placing the order via mail or small parcel carrier not later than the end of the next business day.

(c) Walk-in orders for urgent requirements are accepted and filled immediately provided the individual placing the order has proper identification. Telephone orders placed in the morning may be picked up in the afternoon of the same day provided that the individual picking up the order possesses proper identification and the order ticket number provided by the CSC personnel at the time the order is placed.
