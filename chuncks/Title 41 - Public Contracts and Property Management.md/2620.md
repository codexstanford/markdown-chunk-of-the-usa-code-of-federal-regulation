####### § 102-37.125 What are some donations that do not require GSA's approval?

(a) Some donations of surplus property that do not require GSA's approval are:

(1) Donations of condemned, obsolete, or other specified material by a military department or the Coast Guard to recipients eligible under 10 U.S.C. 2572, 10 U.S.C. 7306, 10 U.S.C. 7541, 10 U.S.C. 7545, and 14 U.S.C. 641a (see appendix A of this part for details). However, such property must first undergo excess Federal and surplus donation screening as required in this part and part 102-36 of this chapter;

(2) Donations by holding agencies to public bodies under subpart H of this part;

(3) Donations by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to small disadvantaged businesses under 13 CFR part 124 (although collaboration and agreement between the SBA, SASPs, and GSA is encouraged); and

(4) Donations by holding agencies of law enforcement canines to their handlers under 40 U.S.C. 555.

(b) You may also donate property directly to eligible non-Federal recipients under other circumstances if you have statutory authority to do so. All such donations must be included on your annual report to GSA under § 102-36.300 of this chapter.
