######## § 102-34.130 How do we display U.S. Government license plates on Government motor vehicles?

(a) Display official U.S. Government license plates on the front and rear of all Government motor vehicles. The exception is two-wheeled motor vehicles and trailers, which require rear license plates only.

(b) You must display U.S. Government license plates on the Government motor vehicle to which the license plates were assigned.

(c) Display the U.S. Government license plates until the Government motor vehicle is removed from Government service or is transferred outside the agency, or until the plates are damaged and require replacement. U.S. Government license plates shall only be used for one Government motor vehicle and shall not be reissued to another Government motor vehicle.

(d) For motor vehicles owned or commercially leased by DOD, also follow DOD regulations.
