(a) Upon discovery of any discrepancy between the inventory records and the bureau's actual amount of seized personal property, a board of survey shall conduct an investigation in accordance with 41 CFR 128-51.1.

(b) If the discrepancy cannot be eliminated and involves a shortage, the bureau shall notify the U.S. attorney in charge of the litigation involving the missing property of the shortage as soon as possible.

(c) If the discrepancy cannot be eliminated and involves an overage, the bureau shall determine if the property has any evidentiary value. If the property does have evidentiary value, the property shall be properly stored and inventoried. If the property does not have any evidentiary value, the bureau shall determine whether the property is forfeitable to the United States, voluntarily abandoned, or abandoned. Proper proceedings shall be commenced as soon as possible to vest title of the forfeitable property in the United States. The voluntarily abandoned and abandoned property shall be kept in custody in accordance with 41 CFR 101-48 and any applicable Justice property management regulations.
