(1) Arrange for alterations, improvements, and repairs to buildings and facilities;

(2) Locate and provide alternative space that will not result in one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible; or

(3) Take any other actions that result in making this agency's programs accessible.

(c) GSA may not require the agency to accept space that results in one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible.
