(a) Personal property must be processed through DOE electronic internal screening prior to reporting excess personal property to GSA.

(b) An additional 30-day screening period shall be allocated for items eligible for screening by educational institutions through LEDP.

(d) The Department of Energy National Utilization Officer (NUO) may authorize in exceptional or unusual cases when time is critical, screening of excess property may be accomplished by with due consideration given to the additional costs involved. Examples of situations when this method of screening would be used are when there is a requirement for quick disposal actions due to unplanned contract terminations or facilities closing; to alleviate the paying of storage costs; when storage space is critical; to process exchange/sale transactions; property dangerous to public health and safety; property determined to be classified or otherwise sensitive for reasons of national security (when classified communications facilities are used); or for hazardous materials which may not be disposed of outside of the Department.

(e) Concurrent DOE and Federal agency screening shall not be conducted.
