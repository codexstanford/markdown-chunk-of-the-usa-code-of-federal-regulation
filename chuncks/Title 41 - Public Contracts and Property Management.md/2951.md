(a) The holding agency is responsible for the care and handling of hazardous materials and property requiring special handling until the time the property has:

(1) Completed the disposal process; and

(2) Been transferred, donated, sold or destroyed, as authorized by this part. The nature of this material may require extra precautions, processes or equipment, thereby increasing the cost of care and handling. The costs associated with performing care and handling may be charged to the Federal agency or donation recipient in accordance with § 102-40.95.

(b) When transferring personal property to another federal agency, failure to disclose hazards or special handling requirements may result in the transferring agency being liable for additional costs incurred by the recipient agency, when authorized by applicable law and policy.
