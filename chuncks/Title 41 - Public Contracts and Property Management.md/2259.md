######## § 102-33.210 How do we account for the use of our Government aircraft?

To account for the use of Government aircraft, including your Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), you must document all flights and keep this documentation for two years after the date of the flight. For each flight, record the-

(a) Aircraft's registration mark;

(b) Owner and operator (the owner may not be the operator, as is the case when a CAS aircraft, owned commercially, is operated by U.S. Government personnel);

(c) Purpose of the flight (the Governmental function that the aircraft was dispatched to perform);

(d) Departure and destination points;

(e) Flight date(s) and times;

(f) Manifest (see § 102-33.165(g) and (h)); and

(g) Name(s) of the pilot(s) and crewmembers.
