(a) Government motor vehicles shall not be used for transportation between residence and place of employment by designated contractor personnel except under extenuating circumstances specifically provided for under the terms of the contract. Examples of circumstances eligible for prior approval of home-to-work motor vehicle use which would be appropriate to include in the terms of the contract include: Use related to safety or security operations, use related to compelling operational considerations, and use determined as cost effective to DOE's interest. Under no circumstances shall the comfort and convenience, or managerial position, of contractor employees be considered justification for authorization of use.

(b) The use of Government motor vehicles for transportation between residence and place of employment (including sporadic use) by designated contractor personnel shall be approved in writing by the Head of the field organization or designee, with delegation no lower than the Director, Office of Management and Program Secretarial Officer (PSO) or the equivalent position at other DOE contracting activities provided that the individual is a warranted contracting officer. The contractor's request for approval shall include the name and title of the employee, the reason for the use, and the expected duration of the use. Each authorization is limited to one year, but can be extended for an unlimited number of additional one-year periods.
