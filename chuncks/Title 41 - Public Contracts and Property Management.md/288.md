(a) Every Committee member and employee who is involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of a system of records, or who has access to a system of records, shall familiarize himself with the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and the Committee regulations and orders issued thereunder and apply these requirements to all systems of records.

(b) No Committee member or employee shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains, unless the disclosure would be to a recipient specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The term "record" means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including but not limited to, his education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and that contains his name, or the identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a finger or voice print or a photograph. The term "system of records" means a group of any records under the control of the Committee from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. The term "routine use" means, with respect to the disclosure of a record, the use of such record for a purpose which is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected. The term "individual" means a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. The term "agency" is defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(e).

(c) An employee may disclose any record which is contained in a system of records, without a written request by and without the prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains, if the disclosure would be:

(1) To those Committee members and employees of the agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties;

(2) Required under section 552 of Title 5 U.S.C.;

(3) For a routine use as described in paragraph (b) of this section;

(4) To the Bureau of the Census for purposes of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to the provisions of Title 13 U.S.C.;

(5) To a recipient who has provided the agency with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred in a form that is not individually identifiable;

(6) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the Administrator of General Services or his designee to determine whether the record has such value;

(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the agency which maintains the record specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;

(8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual if upon such disclosure notification is transmitted to the last known address of such individual;

(9) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress or subcommittee of any such joint committee;

(10) To the Comptroller General, or any of his authorized representatives, in the course of the performance of the duties of the General Accounting Office; or

(11) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) No Committee member or employee shall maintain a record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.

(e) No Committee member or employee shall sell or rent an individual's name and address unless such action is specifically authorized by law.

(f) A Committee member or employee, who by virtue of his employment or official position, has possession of, or access to, agency records which contain individually identifiable information the disclosure of which is prohibited by paragraph a of this section or by any other rules or regulations established under the Privacy Act of 1974, and who (1) knowing that disclosure of the specific material is so prohibited, willfully discloses the material in any manner to any person or agency not entitled to receive it, or (2) willfully maintains a system of records without meeting the notice requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, or (3) knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record concerning an individual from any agency under false pretenses, is subject to criminal penalties and administrative sanctions. Any Committee member or employee who (i) makes a determination not to amend an individual's record in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, or (ii) refuses to comply with an individual's request to gain access to review, and obtain a copy of any information pertaining to him, or (iii) fails to maintain any record concerning any individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications, character, rights, or opportunities or of benefits to the individual that may be made on the basis of such record, and consequently a determination is made which is adverse to the individual, or (iv) fails to comply with any provision of the Privacy Act of 1974 or any Committee regulation implementing it, subjects the Committee to civil penalties and himself to administrative sanctions.
