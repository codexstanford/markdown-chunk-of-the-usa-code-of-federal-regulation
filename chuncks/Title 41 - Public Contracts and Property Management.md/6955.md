####### § 302-17.33 May I ask my agency to recalculate my RITA?

(a) Yes, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA provided you filed your "Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status," and amended it, if necessary, in a timely manner. If, once you have completed all Federal, state, and local tax returns, you believe that your RITA should have been significantly different from the RITA that your agency calculated, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA. This is true for either the one-year or two-year process. With any request for recalculation, you must submit a statement explaining why you believe your RITA was incorrect.

(b) Please note that your agency may require that you also submit an amended "Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status" (if, for example, you inadvertently did not report some of your income in your original Statement), your actual tax returns, or both, as attachments to your request for recalculation.
