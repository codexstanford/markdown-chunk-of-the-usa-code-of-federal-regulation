####### § 102-85.125 What alternate methods may be used to establish Rent in Federally-owned space?

Alternate methods of establishing Rent are based on private sector models. They include, but are not limited to:

(a) Return on investment (ROI) approach or a similar cost recovery method used when market comparables are not available and/or GSA must "build to suit" to fulfill customer agency requirements; e.g., border stations; and

(b) Rent schedules for the right to use rooftops and other floor areas not suitable for workspace; e.g., antenna sites and signage.
