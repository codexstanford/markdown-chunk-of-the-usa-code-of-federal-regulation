####### § 101-25.101-4 Supply through indefinite quantity requirement contracts.

The following criteria shall govern in determining whether an item can be most advantageously supplied through the medium of indefinite quantity requirement contracts covering specific periods and providing for delivery to use points as needs arise:

(a) The item shall be such a character that-

(1) Handling on a storage and issue basis is not economically sound, under the criteria prescribed in § 101-25.101-2;

(2) Rate of use and frequency of ordering at use points is estimated to be sufficient to warrant the making of indefinite quantity requirement contracts;

(3) It is either not feasible to forecast definite requirements for delivery to specific use points (as in the case of new items initially being introduced into a supply system), or no advantage accrues doing so; and

(b) Industry distribution facilities are adequate properly to serve the use points involved; and

(c) Conditions exist where any of the following factors requires the maintaining of indefinite quantity requirements contracts-

(1) Advantage to the Government is greater than would be secured by definite quantity procurements by individual offices or agencies (the determining consideration being one of overall economy to the Government, rather than one of direct comparison of unit prices of individual items obtainable through other methods of supply); or no known procurement economies would be effected but the requirements of offices of agencies can best be served by indefinite quantity requirements contracts.

(2) Acute competitive bidding problems exist because of highly technical matters which can best be met on a centralized contracting basis.

(3) The item is proprietary or so complex in design, function, or operation as to be noncompetitive and procurement can best be performed on a centralized contracting basis.
