####### Siting Antennas on Federal Property
######## § 102-79.90 What criteria must Executive agencies consider when evaluating antenna siting requests?

When evaluating antenna siting requests, Executive agencies must consider issues such as-

(a) Public health and safety with respect to the antenna installation and maintenance;

(b) Aesthetics;

(c) Effects on historic districts, sites, buildings, monuments, structures, or other objects pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and implementing regulations;

(d) Protection of natural and cultural resources (e.g., National Parks and Wilderness areas, National Wildlife Refuge systems);

(e) Compliance with the appropriate level of review and documentation as necessary under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and implementing regulations of each Federal department and agency responsible for the antenna siting project, and the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies;

(f) Compliance with the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) guidelines for radiofrequency exposure, ET Docket No. 93-62, entitled "Guidelines for Evaluating the Environmental Effects of Radiofrequency Radiation," issued August 1, 1996, and any other order on reconsideration relating to radiofrequency guidelines and their enforcement. These are updated guidelines for meeting health concerns that reflect the latest scientific knowledge in this area, and are supported by Federal health and safety agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration; and

(g) Any requirements of the Federal agency managing the facility, FCC, Federal Aviation Administration, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, and other relevant departments and agencies. To the maximum extent practicable, when placing antennas for the provision of telecommunication services to the Federal Government, agencies should use redundant and physically separate entry points into the building and physically diverse local network facilities in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget. In addition, the National Capital Planning Commission should be consulted for siting requests within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.
