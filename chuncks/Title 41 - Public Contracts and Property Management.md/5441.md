When approved, a memorandum transmitting the loan agreement shall be prepared identifying the loan period, delivery time, method of payment and transportation, and point of delivery and return, to ensure proper control and protect DOE's interest. The domestic loan period shall not exceed one year, but may be renewed in one year increments. Second renewals of loan agreements shall be reviewed and justified at a level of management at least two levels above that of the individual making the determination to loan the property. Third renewals shall be approved by the head of the field organization or designee.
