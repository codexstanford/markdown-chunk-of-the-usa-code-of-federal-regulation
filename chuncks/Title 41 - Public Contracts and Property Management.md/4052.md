####### § 102-117.290 What is the difference between temporary nonuse, suspension and debarment?

(a) Temporary nonuse is limited to your agency and initiated by the agency transportation officers for a period not to exceed 90 days for:

(1) Willful violations of the terms of the rate tender;

(2) Persistent or willful failure to meet requested packing and pickup service;

(3) Failure to meet required delivery dates;

(4) Violation of Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous material regulations;

(5) Mishandling of freight, damaged or missing transportation seals, improper loading, blocking, packing or bracing of property;

(6) Improper routing of property;

(7) Subjecting your shipments to unlawful seizure or detention by failing to pay debts;

(8) Operating without legal authority;

(9) Failure to settle claims according to Government regulations; or

(10) Repeated failure to comply with regulations of DOT, Surface Transportation Board, State or local governments or other Government agencies.

(b) Suspension is disqualifying a TSP from receiving orders for certain services under a contract or rate tender pending an investigation or legal proceeding. A TSP may be suspended on adequate evidence of:

(1) Fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a contract for transportation;

(2) Violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes;

(3) Embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property; and

(4) Any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or business honesty that seriously and directly affects the present responsibility of the TSP as a transporter of the Government's property or the HHG of its employees relocated for the Government.

(c) Debarment means action taken to exclude a contractor from contracting with all Federal agencies. The seriousness of the TSP's acts or omissions and the mitigating factors must be considered in making any debarment decisions. A TSP may be debarred for the following reasons:

(1) Failure of a TSP to take the necessary corrective actions within the period of temporary nonuse; or

(2) Conviction of or civil judgment for any of the causes for suspension.
