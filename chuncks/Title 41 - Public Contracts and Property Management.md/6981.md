####### § 302-17.66 How do I claim my RITA under the two-year process?

(a) To claim your RITA under the two-year process, you must submit a voucher and attach the "Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status," as discussed in §§ 302-17.63-302-17.65.

(b) Your voucher must claim a specific amount. However, your agency will calculate your actual RITA after you submit your RITA voucher and your "Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status;" the amount you claim on your voucher does not enter into that calculation. You should perform the RITA calculation for yourself, as a check on your agency's calculation, but you are not required to put the "right answer" on the voucher you submit to claim your RITA.
