####### § 102-41.85 What choices do I have for retaining or disposing of voluntarily abandoned personal property?

You may either retain or dispose of voluntarily abandoned personal property based on the following circumstances:

(a) If your agency has a need for the property, you may retain it for official use, except for large sedans and limousines which may only be retained for official use as authorized under part 102-34 of this subchapter B. See § 102-41.90 for how retained property must be handled.

(b) If your agency doesn't need the property, you should determine whether it may be abandoned or destroyed in accordance with the provisions at FMR 102-36.305 through 102-36.330. Furthermore, in addition to the circumstances when property may be abandoned or destroyed without public notice at FMR 102-36.330, voluntarily abandoned property may also be abandoned or destroyed without public notice when the estimated resale value of the property is less than $500.

(c) If the property is not retained for official use or abandoned or destroyed, you must report it to GSA as excess in accordance with § 102-41.95.
