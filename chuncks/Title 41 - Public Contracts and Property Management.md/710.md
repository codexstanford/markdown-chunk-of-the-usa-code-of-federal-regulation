(j) Impose appropriate sanctions against any party or person failing to obey an order under these rules which may include:

(1) Refusing to allow the disobedient party to support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting it from introducing designated matters in evidence;

(k) Take official notice of any material fact not appearing in evidence in the record, which is among the traditional matters of judicial notice;

(l) Recommend whether the respondent is in current violation of the order, regulations, or its contractual obligations, as well as the nature of the relief necessary to insure the full enjoyment of the rights secured by the order;
