####### Outleasing
######## § 102-79.65 May Executive agencies outlease space on major public access levels, courtyards and rooftops of public buildings?

Yes. Authority to execute such outleases may be delegated by the Administrator based on authorities provided by the Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act (40 U.S.C. § 581(h)), the proceeds of which are to be deposited into GSA's Federal Buildings Fund. Using such authority, Executive agencies, upon approval from GSA, may-

(a) Enter into leases of space on major public access levels, courtyards and rooftops of any public building with persons, firms, or organizations engaged in commercial, cultural, educational, or recreational activities (as defined in 40 U.S.C. 3306);

(b) Establish rental rates for such leased space equivalent to the prevailing commercial rate for comparable space devoted to a similar purpose in the vicinity of the building; and

(c) Use leases that contain terms and conditions that the Administrator deems necessary to promote competition and protect the public interest.
