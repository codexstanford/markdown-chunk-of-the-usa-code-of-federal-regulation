####### § 302-8.108 What is the authorized time period for extended storage of my HHG?

The authorized time period for extended storage of your HHG is for the duration of the assignment not to exceed 3-years. However:

(a) Your agency will conduct periodic reviews to determine whether current housing conditions at your isolated official station warrant continuation of storage;

(b) Eligibility for extended storage at Government expense will terminate on your last day of active duty at the isolated official station. However your HHG may remain in temporary storage for an additional period of time not to exceed 90 days, if approved by your agency.

(c) When eligibility ceases, storage at Government expense may continue until the beginning of the second month after the month in which your tour at the official station OCONUS terminates, unless to avoid inequity your agency extends the period.
