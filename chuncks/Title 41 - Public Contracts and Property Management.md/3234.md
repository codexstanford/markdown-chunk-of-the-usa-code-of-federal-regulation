######## § 102-73.290 Are there any prohibitions when a Federal agency pays "just compensation" to a tenant?

Yes, Federal agencies must not-

(a) Duplicate any payment to the tenant otherwise authorized by law; and

(b) Pay a tenant unless the landowner disclaims all interests in the tenant's improvements. In consideration for any such payment, the tenant must assign, transfer, and release to the Federal agency all of its right, title, and interest in the improvements. The tenant may reject such payment under this subpart and obtain payment for its property interests according to other sections of applicable law.
