####### § 101-8.308 Preemployment inquiries.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination or may not make preemployment inquiries of an applicant as to whether the applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiries into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.

(b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination, or is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity, or when a recipient is taking affirmative action under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether, and to what extent, they are handicapped provided that:

(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally, if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and

(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this subpart.

(c) This section does not prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty provided that all entering employees are subjected to the examination regardless of handicap or absence of handicap and results of the examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this subpart.

(d) Information obtained in accordance with this section concerning the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms that are to be accorded confidentiality as medical records, except that:

(1) Supervisors and managers may be informed of restrictions on the work or duties of handicapped persons and of necessary accommodations;

(2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; and

(3) Government officials investigating compliance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, shall be provided relevant information upon request.
