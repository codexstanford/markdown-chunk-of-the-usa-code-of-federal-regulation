###### § 204.57-6 Acceptance and rejection of batches.

(a) A failing compressor is one whose measured sound level is in excess of the applicable noise emission standard.

(b) The batch from which a batch sample is selected will be accepted or rejected based upon the number of failing compressors in the batch sample. A sufficient number of test samples will be drawn from the batch sample until the cumulative number of failing compressors is less than or equal to the acceptance number or greater than or equal to the rejection number appropriate for the cumulative number of compressors tested. The acceptance and rejection numbers listed in Appendix I, Table II at the appropriate code letter obtained according to § 204.57-2 will be used in determining whether the acceptance or rejection of a batch has occurred.

(c) Acceptance or rejection of a batch takes place when a decision is made on the last compressor required to make a decision under paragraph (b) of this section.
