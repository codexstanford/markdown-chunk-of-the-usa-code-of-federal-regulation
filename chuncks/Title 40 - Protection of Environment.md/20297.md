####### § 60.2100 What if all the qualified operators are temporarily not accessible?
######## i.e.,

If all qualified operators are temporarily not accessible (not at the facility and not able to be at the facility within 1 hour), you must meet one of the two criteria specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, depending on the length of time that a qualified operator is not accessible:

(a) When all qualified operators are not accessible for more than 8 hours, but less than 2 weeks, the CISWI may be operated by other plant personnel familiar with the operation of the CISWI who have completed a review of the information specified in § 60.2095(a) within the past 12 months. However, you must record the period when all qualified operators were not accessible and include this deviation in the annual report as specified under § 60.2210; and

(b) When all qualified operators are not accessible for 2 weeks or more, you must take the two actions that are described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Notify the Administrator of this deviation in writing within 10 days. In the notice, state what caused this deviation, what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, and when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible; and

(2) Submit a status report to the Administrator every 4 weeks outlining what you are doing to ensure that a qualified operator is accessible, stating when you anticipate that a qualified operator will be accessible and requesting approval from the Administrator to continue operation of the CISWI. You must submit the first status report 4 weeks after you notify the Administrator of the deviation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the Administrator notifies you that your request to continue operation of the CISWI is disapproved, the CISWI may continue operation for 90 days, then must cease operation. Operation of the unit may resume if you meet the two requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:

(i) A qualified operator is accessible as required under § 60.2070(a); and

(ii) You notify the Administrator that a qualified operator is accessible and that you are resuming operation.
