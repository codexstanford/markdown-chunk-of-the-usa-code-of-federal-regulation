####### § 310.24 What happens if I provide incorrect or false information?

(a) You must not knowingly or recklessly make any statement or provide any information in your reimbursement application that is false, misleading, misrepresented, or misstated. If you do provide incorrect or false information, and EPA relies on that information in making a reimbursement decision, we may deny your application and withdraw or recover the full amount of your award. In such a case, we would give you written notice of our intentions.
