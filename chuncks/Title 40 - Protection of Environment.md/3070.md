##### § 47.115 Award amount and matching requirements.

(a) Individual awards shall not exceed $250,000, and 25 percent of all funds obligated under this section in a fiscal year shall be for individual awards of not more than $5,000.

(b) The Federal share shall not exceed 75 percent of the total project costs. The non-Federal share of project costs may be provided by in-kind contributions and other noncash support. In cases where the EPA determines that a proposed project merits support and cannot be undertaken without a higher rate of Federal support, the EPA may approve awards with a matching requirement other than that specified in this paragraph, including full Federal funding.
