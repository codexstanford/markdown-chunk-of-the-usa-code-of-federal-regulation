##### Subpart GGG - Federal Plan Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills That Commenced Construction Prior to May 30, 1991 and Have Not Been Modified or Reconstructed Since May 30, 1991
###### § 62.14352 Designated facilities.

(a) The designated facility to which this subpart applies is each municipal solid waste landfill in all States, protectorates, and Indian Country that meets the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, except for landfills exempted by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

(1) The municipal solid waste landfill commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification before May 30, 1991 (landfills that commence construction, modification, or reconstruction on or after May 30, 1991 are subject to 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW), and

(2) The municipal solid waste landfill has accepted waste at any time since November 8, 1987 or the landfill has additional capacity for future waste deposition.

(b) A municipal solid waste landfill regulated by an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is not subject to the requirements of this subpart. States that have an approved and effective State plan are listed in table 1 of this subpart. Notwithstanding the exclusions in table 1 of this subpart, any MSW landfill located in a State or portion of Indian country that does not have an EPA approved and currently effective State or Tribal plan is subject to the requirements of this subpart.

(c) A municipal solid waste landfill located in a State, locality, or portion of Indian country that submitted a negative declaration letter is not subject to the requirements of this subpart other than the requirements in the definition of design capacity to recalculate the site-specific density annually and in § 62.14355 to submit an amended design capacity report in the event that the recalculated design capacity is equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters. However, if the existing municipal solid waste landfill already has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters, then it is subject to the requirements of the Federal plan. States, localities, or portions of Indian country that submitted negative declaration letters are listed in table 2 of this subpart.

(d) Physical or operational changes made to an existing municipal solid waste landfill solely to comply with an emission guideline are not considered a modification or reconstruction and would not subject an existing municipal solid waste landfill to the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW.

(e) For purposes of obtaining an operating permit under title V of the Clean Air Act, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters is not subject to the requirement to obtain an operating permit for the landfill under part 70 or 71 of this chapter, unless the landfill is otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71. For purposes of submitting a timely application for an operating permit under part 70 or 71, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity greater than or equal to 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2,000 and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter April 6, 2000, even if the initial design capacity report is submitted earlier. In addition, the owner or operator of a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart with a design capacity less than 2.5 million megagrams or 2.5 million cubic meters on January 7, 2000, and not otherwise subject to either part 70 or 71, but whose design capacity subsequently increases to equal or exceed 2.5 million megagrams and 2.5 million cubic meters by a change that is not a modification or reconstruction becomes subject to the requirements of § 70.5(a)(1)(i) or § 71.5(a)(1)(i) of this chapter upon the date the amended design capacity report is due.

(f) When a municipal solid waste landfill subject to this subpart is closed, the owner or operator is no longer subject to the requirement to maintain an operating permit under part 70 or 71 of this chapter for the landfill if the landfill is not otherwise subject to the requirements of either part 70 or 71 and if either of the following conditions are met:

(1) The landfill was never subject to the requirement for a control system under § 62.14353 of this subpart; or

(2) The owner or operator meets the conditions for control system removal specified in 40 CFR 60.752(b)(2)(v).
