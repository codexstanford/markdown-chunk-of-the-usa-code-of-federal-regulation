(b)(1) Each petition shall be signed by the petitioner and shall state the petitioner's name and address. If the petitioner is a corporation, the petition shall be signed by an authorized officer of the corporation, and the petition shall indicate the state of incorporation. Where the petitioner elects to be represented by counsel, a signed notice to that effect shall be included with the petition at the time of filing.

In the case of facts stated on information and belief, the source of such information and grounds of belief shall be given. The statement of facts shall include the following:

(i) An identification of the provisions of the Act and/or regulations thereunder that the petitioner maintains petitioner will be able to comply with if the petitioner is granted the patent license that is the subject of the petition;

(iv) A summary of facts demonstrating that the patent under which a mandatory patent license is sought is being used or is intended for public or commercial use;

(v) An explanation of why a mandatory patent license is necessary for the petitioner to comply with the requirements of sections 111, 112 or 202 of the Act, and why the patented technology is not otherwise available;

(vi) An explanation of why there are no other reasonable alternatives for accomplishing compliance with sections 111, 112 or 202 of the Act;

(vii) An explanation of why the unavailability of a mandatory patent license may result in a substantial lessening of competition or a tendency to create a monopoly in any line of commerce in any section of the United States;

(viii) A summary of efforts made by the petitioner to obtain a patent license from the owner of the patent, including the terms and conditions of any patent license proposed by petitioner to the patent owner; and

(ix) The terms, if any, on which the owner of the patent has proposed to grant the petitioner a patent license.

(5) Each petition shall include a proposed patent license that states all of the terms and conditions that the petitioner proposes for the patent license.

(e) If the Administrator, or the Administrator's designee, finds that the criteria in § 95.3 are met and decides to apply to the Attorney General for a patent license under section 308 of the Act, notice of such application shall be given to the petitioner, along with a copy of the application sent to the Attorney General.
