###### Emission Standards for Owners and Operators
####### § 60.4233 What emission standards must I meet if I am an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal combustion engine?

(a) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power less than or equal to 19 KW (25 HP) manufactured on or after July 1, 2008, must comply with the emission standards in § 60.4231(a) for their stationary SI ICE.

(b) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) manufactured on or after the applicable date in § 60.4230(a)(4) that use gasoline must comply with the emission standards in § 60.4231(b) for their stationary SI ICE.

(c) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) manufactured on or after the applicable date in § 60.4230(a)(4) that are rich burn engines that use LPG must comply with the emission standards in § 60.4231(c) for their stationary SI ICE.

(d) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) and less than 75 KW (100 HP) (except gasoline and rich burn engines that use LPG) must comply with the emission standards for field testing in 40 CFR 1048.101(c) for their non-emergency stationary SI ICE and with the emission standards in Table 1 to this subpart for their emergency stationary SI ICE. Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) and less than 75 KW (100 HP) manufactured prior to January 1, 2011, that were certified to the standards in Table 1 to this subpart applicable to engines with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 100 HP and less than 500 HP, may optionally choose to meet those standards.

(e) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 75 KW (100 HP) (except gasoline and rich burn engines that use LPG) must comply with the emission standards in Table 1 to this subpart for their stationary SI ICE. For owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 100 HP (except gasoline and rich burn engines that use LPG) manufactured prior to January 1, 2011 that were certified to the certification emission standards in 40 CFR part 1048 applicable to engines that are not severe duty engines, if such stationary SI ICE was certified to a carbon monoxide (CO) standard above the standard in Table 1 to this subpart, then the owners and operators may meet the CO certification (not field testing) standard for which the engine was certified.

(f) Owners and operators of any modified or reconstructed stationary SI ICE subject to this subpart must meet the requirements as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.

(1) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power less than or equal to 19 KW (25 HP), that are modified or reconstructed after June 12, 2006, must comply with emission standards in § 60.4231(a) for their stationary SI ICE. Engines with a date of manufacture prior to July 1, 2008 must comply with the emission standards specified in § 60.4231(a) applicable to engines manufactured on July 1, 2008.

(2) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) that are gasoline engines and are modified or reconstructed after June 12, 2006, must comply with the emission standards in § 60.4231(b) for their stationary SI ICE. Engines with a date of manufacture prior to July 1, 2008 (or January 1, 2009 for emergency engines) must comply with the emission standards specified in § 60.4231(b) applicable to engines manufactured on July 1, 2008 (or January 1, 2009 for emergency engines).

(3) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP) that are rich burn engines that use LPG, that are modified or reconstructed after June 12, 2006, must comply with the same emission standards as those specified in § 60.4231(c). Engines with a date of manufacture prior to July 1, 2008 (or January 1, 2009 for emergency engines) must comply with the emission standards specified in § 60.4231(c) applicable to engines manufactured on July 1, 2008 (or January 1, 2009 for emergency engines).

(4) Owners and operators of stationary SI natural gas and lean burn LPG engines with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP), that are modified or reconstructed after June 12, 2006, must comply with the same emission standards as those specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, except that such owners and operators of non-emergency engines and emergency engines greater than or equal to 130 HP must meet a nitrogen oxides (NO) emission standard of 3.0 grams per HP-hour (g/HP-hr), a CO emission standard of 4.0 g/HP-hr (5.0 g/HP-hr for non-emergency engines less than 100 HP), and a volatile organic compounds (VOC) emission standard of 1.0 g/HP-hr, or a NOemission standard of 250 ppmvd at 15 percent oxygen (O), a CO emission standard 540 ppmvd at 15 percent O(675 ppmvd at 15 percent Ofor non-emergency engines less than 100 HP), and a VOC emission standard of 86 ppmvd at 15 percent O, where the date of manufacture of the engine is:

(i) Prior to July 1, 2007, for non-emergency engines with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 500 HP (except lean burn natural gas engines and LPG engines with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 500 HP and less than 1,350 HP);

(ii) Prior to July 1, 2008, for non-emergency engines with a maximum engine power less than 500 HP;

(iii) Prior to January 1, 2009, for emergency engines;

(iv) Prior to January 1, 2008, for non-emergency lean burn natural gas engines and LPG engines with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 500 HP and less than 1,350 HP.

(5) Owners and operators of stationary SI landfill/digester gas ICE engines with a maximum engine power greater than 19 KW (25 HP), that are modified or reconstructed after June 12, 2006, must comply with the same emission standards as those specified in paragraph (e) of this section for stationary landfill/digester gas engines. Engines with maximum engine power less than 500 HP and a date of manufacture prior to July 1, 2008 must comply with the emission standards specified in paragraph (e) of this section for stationary landfill/digester gas ICE with a maximum engine power less than 500 HP manufactured on July 1, 2008. Engines with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 500 HP (except lean burn engines greater than or equal to 500 HP and less than 1,350 HP) and a date of manufacture prior to July 1, 2007 must comply with the emission standards specified in paragraph (e) of this section for stationary landfill/digester gas ICE with a maximum engine power greater than or equal to 500 HP (except lean burn engines greater than or equal to 500 HP and less than 1,350 HP) manufactured on July 1, 2007. Lean burn engines greater than or equal to 500 HP and less than 1,350 HP with a date of manufacture prior to January 1, 2008 must comply with the emission standards specified in paragraph (e) of this section for stationary landfill/digester gas ICE that are lean burn engines greater than or equal to 500 HP and less than 1,350 HP and manufactured on January 1, 2008.

(g) Owners and operators of stationary SI wellhead gas ICE engines may petition the Administrator for approval on a case-by-case basis to meet emission standards no less stringent than the emission standards that apply to stationary emergency SI engines greater than 25 HP and less than 130 HP due to the presence of high sulfur levels in the fuel, as specified in Table 1 to this subpart. The request must, at a minimum, demonstrate that the fuel has high sulfur levels that prevent the use of aftertreatment controls and also that the owner has reasonably made all attempts possible to obtain an engine that will meet the standards without the use of aftertreatment controls. The petition must request the most stringent standards reasonably applicable to the engine using the fuel.

(h) Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE that are required to meet standards that reference 40 CFR 1048.101 must, if testing their engines in use, meet the standards in that section applicable to field testing, except as indicated in paragraph (e) of this section.
