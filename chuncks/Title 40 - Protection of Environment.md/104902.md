###### § 1090.1705 Evidence related to violations.

(a)(1) EPA may use results from any testing required under this part to determine whether a given fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock meets any applicable standard. However, EPA may also use any other evidence or information to make this determination if the evidence or information supports the conclusion that the fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock would fail to meet one or more of the parameter specifications in this part if the appropriate sampling and testing methodology had been correctly performed. Examples of other relevant information include business records, commercial documents, and measurements with alternative procedures.

(2) Testing to determine noncompliance with this part may occur at any location and be performed by any party.

(b) Determinations of compliance with the requirements of this part other than the fuel, fuel additive, or regulated blendstock standards, and determinations of liability for any violation of this part, may be based on information from any source or location. Such information may include, but is not limited to, business records and commercial documents.
