###### § 98.313 Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the annual process COemissions for each chloride process line using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the process COemissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) Calculate and report under this subpart the annual process COemissions for each chloride process line by determining the mass of calcined petroleum coke consumed in each line as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. Use Equation EE-1 of this section to calulate annual combined process COemissions from all process lines and use Equation EE-2 of this section to calculate annual process COemissions for each process line. If your facility generates carbon-containing waste, use Equation EE-3 of this section to estimate the annual quantity of carbon-containing waste generated and its carbon contents according to § 98.314(e) and (f):

(1) You must calculate the annual COprocess emissions from all process lines at the facility using Equation EE-1 of this section:

(2) You must calculate the annual COprocess emissions from each process lines at the facility using Equation EE-2 of this section:

(3) If facility generates carbon-containing waste, you must calculate the total annual quantity of carbon-containing waste produced from all process lines using Equation EE-3 of this section and its carbon contents according to § 98.314(e) and (f):

(c) If GHG emissions from a chloride process line are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports COemissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process COemissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.
