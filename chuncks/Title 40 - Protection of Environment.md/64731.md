###### § 246.201-5 Recommended procedures: Methods of separation and collection.

Following separation within the home, any of the following methods of collection may be used:

(a) Materials may be placed at the curbside by the resident and may be collected from each household using separate trucks or compartmentalized vehicles.

(b) For multi-family dwellings, separated materials may be placed in bulk containers located outside of the building and collected by trucks dispatched to collect recyclables.

(c) Collection stations may be set up at convenient locations to which residents bring recyclables. These stations should provide separate bulk containers for each item to be recycled. The size and type of container will depend on the volume and type of material collected, the method of transportation to be used in hauling the materials to market and the frequency of removal.
