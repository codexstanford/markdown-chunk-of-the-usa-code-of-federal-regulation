(a) You must submit the "EPA Fellowship Completion of Studies Notice" (EPA Form 5770-9) signed by your sponsor or department head of the educational institution when the project period ends. In certain instances, e.g., your program of study is at an EPA facility, the EPA project officer may sign as sponsor on the Completion of Studies Notice. You may request an extension to submit the form if you need it.

(b) You must retain all records related to your fellowship agreement for three years after the completion date you insert on the "Completion of Studies Notice" (EPA Form 5770-9).

(c) EPA, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, has the right of timely and unrestricted access to your documents, papers, or other records related to your fellowship, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.
