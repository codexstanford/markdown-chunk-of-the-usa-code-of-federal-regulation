###### § 1045.735 What records must I keep?

(a) You must organize and maintain your records as described in this section. We may review your records at any time.

(b) Keep the records required by this section for at least eight years after the due date for the end-of-year report. You may not use emission credits for any engines or vessel if you do not keep all the records required under this section. You must therefore keep these records to continue to bank valid credits. Store these records in any format and on any media as long as you can promptly send us organized, written records in English if we ask for them. You must keep these records readily available. We may review them at any time.

(c) Keep a copy of the reports we require in §§ 1045.725 and 1045.730.

(d) Keep records of the engine identification number for each engine or vessel you produce that generates or uses emission credits under the ABT program. You may identify these numbers as a range.

(e) We may require you to keep additional records or to send us relevant information not required by this section in accordance with the Clean Air Act.
