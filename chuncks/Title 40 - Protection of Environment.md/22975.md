(a) Stationary sources subject to § 61.32(b) shall locate air sampling sites in accordance with a plan approved by the Administrator. Such sites shall be located in such a manner as is calculated to detect maximum concentrations of beryllium in the ambient air.

(b) All monitoring sites shall be operated continuously except for a reasonable time allowance for instrument maintenance and calibration, for changing filters, or for replacement of equipment needing major repair.

(c) Filters shall be analyzed and concentrations calculated within 30 days after filters are collected. Records of concentrations at all sampling sites and other data needed to determine such concentrations shall be retained at the source and made available, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 years.

(d) Concentrations measured at all sampling sites shall be reported to the Administrator every 30 days by a registered letter.

(e) The Administrator may at any time require changes in, or expansion of, the sampling network.
