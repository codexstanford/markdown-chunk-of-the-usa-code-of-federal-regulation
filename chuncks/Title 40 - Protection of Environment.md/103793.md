###### § 1066.405 Vehicle preparation, preconditioning, and maintenance.

(a) Prepare the vehicle for testing (including measurement of evaporative and refueling emissions if appropriate), as described in the standard-setting part.

(b) If you inspect a vehicle, keep a record of the inspection and update your application for certification to document any changes that result. You may use any kind of equipment, instrument, or tool that is available at dealerships and other service outlets to identify malfunctioning components or perform maintenance.

(c) You may repair defective parts from a test vehicle if they are unrelated to emission control. You must ask us to approve repairs that might affect the vehicle's emission controls. If we determine that a part failure, system malfunction, or associated repair makes the vehicle's emission controls unrepresentative of production engines, you may not use it as an emission-data vehicle. Also, if the engine installed in the test vehicle has a major mechanical failure that requires you to take the vehicle apart, you may no longer use the vehicle as an emission-data vehicle for exhaust measurements.
