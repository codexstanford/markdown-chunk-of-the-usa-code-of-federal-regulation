###### § 270.23 Specific part B information requirements for miscellaneous units.

Except as otherwise provided in § 264.600, owners and operators of facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste in miscellaneous units must provide the following additional information:

(a) A detailed description of the unit being used or proposed for use, including the following:

(1) Physical characteristics, materials of construction, and dimensions of the unit;

(2) Detailed plans and engineering reports describing how the unit will be located, designed, constructed, operated, maintained, monitored, inspected, and closed to comply with the requirements of §§ 264.601 and 264.602; and

(3) For disposal units, a detailed description of the plans to comply with the post-closure requirements of § 264.603.

(b) Detailed hydrologic, geologic, and meteorologic assessments and land-use maps for the region surrounding the site that address and ensure compliance of the unit with each factor in the environmental performance standards of § 264.601. If the applicant can demonstrate that he does not violate the environmental performance standards of § 264.601 and the Director agrees with such demonstration, preliminary hydrologic, geologic, and meteorologic assessments will suffice.

(c) Information on the potential pathways of exposure of humans or environmental receptors to hazardous waste or hazardous constituents and on the potential magnitude and nature of such exposures.

(d) For any treatment unit, a report on a demonstration of the effectiveness of the treatment based on laboratory or field data.

(e) Any additional information determined by the Director to be necessary for evaluation of compliance of the unit with the environmental performance standards of § 264.601.
