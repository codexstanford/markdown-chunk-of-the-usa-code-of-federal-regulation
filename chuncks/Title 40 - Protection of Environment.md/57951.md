###### § 147.2923 Corrective action for wells authorized by permit.
####### i.e.

All improperly sealed, completed or abandoned wells (, wells or well bores which may provide an avenue for movement of fluid into an UDSW) within the zone of endangering influence (as defined in § 147.2904, Area of Review) that penetrate the injection zone of a Class II well, must have corrective action taken to prevent movement of fluid into a USDW.

(a) EPA will review completion and plugging records of wells within the zone of endangering influence that penetrate the injection zone and will notify the operator when corrective action is required. Corrective action may include:

(1) Well modifications, including:

(i) Recementing;

(ii) Workover;

(iii) Reconditioning; and/or

(iv) Plugging or replugging;

(2) Permit conditions to limit injection pressure so as to prevent movement of fluid into a USDW;

(3) A more stringent monitoring program; and/or

(4) Periodic testing of other wells within the area of review to determine if significant movement of fluid has occurred. If the monitoring discussed in paragraph (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section indicates the potential endangerment of a USDW, then action as described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section must be taken.

(b) If the Regional Administrator has demonstrable knowledge that wells within the zone of endangering influence will not serve as conduits for fluid movement into a USDW, the permit may be approved without requiring corrective action. However, additional monitoring shall be required to confirm that no significant migration will occur.
