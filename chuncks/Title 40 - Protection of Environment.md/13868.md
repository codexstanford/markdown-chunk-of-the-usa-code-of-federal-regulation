###### § 52.1275 Legal authority.

(a) The requirements of § 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance of a national air quality standard is not adequate.

(b) The requirements of § 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, since section 7106-117 of the Mississippi Code could, in some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, section 7106-117 is disapproved.
