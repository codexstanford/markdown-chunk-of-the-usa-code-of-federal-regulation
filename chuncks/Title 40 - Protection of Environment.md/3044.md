###### § 46.145 International travel and work.

(a) You may use fellowship funds for travel to or work in a foreign country only if the travel or work is approved by the EPA Office of International Activities (OIA). You will be notified of OIA approval in the fellowship award or in a letter from the EPA project officer or the award official.

(b) If you travel to or from a foreign country and the travel cost is paid under the fellowship agreement, you must comply with the Fly America Act. In accordance with that Act, you must travel on U.S. air carriers certificated under 49 U.S.C. 1371, to the extent that such carriers provide service, even if the foreign air carrier costs less than the American air carrier.
