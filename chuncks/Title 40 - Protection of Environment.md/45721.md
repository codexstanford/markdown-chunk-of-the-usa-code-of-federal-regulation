###### § 85.1513 Prohibited acts; penalties.

(a) The importation of a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine which is not covered by a certificate of conformity other than in accordance with this subpart and the entry regulations of the U.S. Customs Service at 19 CFR 12.73 is prohibited. Failure to comply with this section is a violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Act.

(1) Operate the vehicle on streets or highways,

(2) Sell or offer the vehicle or engine for sale, or

(3) Store the vehicle on the premises of a dealer.

(c) Any vehicle or engine conditionally admitted pursuant to § 85.1504, § 85.1511 or § 85.1512, and not granted final admission within 120 days of such conditional admission, or within such additional time as the U.S. Customs Service may allow, shall be deemed to be unlawfully imported into the United States in violation of section 203(a)(1) of the Act, unless such vehicle or engine shall have been delivered to the U.S. Customs Service for export or other disposition under applicable Customs laws and regulations. Any vehicles or engines not so delivered shall be subject to seizure by the U.S. Customs Service.

(d) Any importer who violates section 203(a)(1) of the Act is subject to a civil penalty under section 205 of the Act of not more than $32,500 for each vehicle or engine subject to the violation. In addition to the penalty provided in the Act, where applicable, under the exemption provisions of § 85.1511(b), or under § 85.1512, any person or entity who fails to deliver such vehicle or engine to the U.S. Customs Service is liable for liquidated damages in the amount of the bond required by applicable Customs laws and regulations.

(e)(1) A certificate holder whose vehicles or engines imported under § 85.1505 or § 85.1509 fail to conform to Federal emission requirements after modification and/or testing under the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) or who fails to comply with applicable provisions of this subpart, may, in addition to any other applicable sanctions and penalties, be subject to any, or all, of the following sanctions:

(i) The certificate holder's currently held certificates of conformity may be revoked or suspended;

(ii) The certificate holder may be deemed ineligible to apply for new certificates for up to 3 years; and

(iii) The certificate holder may be deemed ineligible to import vehicles or engines under § 85.1509 in the future and be placed on a list of certificate holders ineligible to import vehicles or engines under the provisions of § 85.1509.

(2) Grounds for the actions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

(i) Action or inaction by the certificate holder or the laboratory performing the FTP on behalf of the certificate holder which results in fraudulent, deceitful or grossly inaccurate representation of any fact or condition which affects a vehicle's or engine's eligibility for admission to the U.S. under this subpart;

(ii) Failure of a significant number of vehicles or engines imported to comply with Federal emission requirements upon EPA inspection or retest; or

(iii) Failure by a certificate holder to comply with requirements of this subpart.

(3) The following procedures govern any decision to suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue certificates under this subpart:

(i) When grounds appear to exist for the actions described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Administrator shall notify the certificate holder in writing of any intended suspension or revocation of a certificate, proposed ineligibility to apply for new certificates, or intended suspension of eligibility to conduct modification/testing under § 85.1509, and the grounds for such action.

(ii) Except as provided by paragraph (e)(3)(iv) of this section, the certificate holder must take the following actions before the Administrator will consider withdrawing notice of intent to suspend or revoke the certificate holder's certificate or the certificate holder's eligibility to perform modification/testing under § 85.1509:

(A) Submit a written report to the Administrator which identifies the reason for the noncompliance of the vehicle or engines, describes the proposed remedy, including a description of any proposed quality control and/or quality assurance measures to be taken by the certificate holder to prevent the future occurrence of the problem, and states the date on which the remedies will be implemented; or

(B) Demonstrate that the vehicles or engines do in fact comply with applicable regulations in this chapter by retesting such vehicles or engines in accordance with the FTP.

(iii) A certificate holder may request within 15 calendar days of the Administrator's notice of intent to suspend or revoke a certificate holder's eligibility to perform modification/testing or certificate that the Administrator grant such certificate holder a hearing:

(A) As to whether the tests have been properly conducted,

(B) As to any substantial factual issue raised by the Administrator's proposed action.

(iv) If, after the Administrator notifies a certificate holder of his/her intent to suspend or revoke a certificate holder's certificate of conformity or its eligibility to perform modification/testing under § 85.1509 and prior to any final suspension or revocation, the certificate holder demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that the decision to initiate suspension or revocation of the certificate or eligibility to perform modification/testing under § 85.1509 was based on erroneous information, the Administrator will withdraw the notice of intent.

(4) Hearings on suspensions and revocations of certificates of conformity or of eligibility to perform modification/testing under § 85.1509 shall be held in accordance with 40 CFR part 1068, subpart G.

(5) [Reserved]

(6) In lieu of requesting a hearing under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, a certificate holder may respond in writing to EPA's charges in the notice of intent to suspend or revoke. Such a written response must be received by EPA within 30 days of the date of EPA's notice of intent. No final decision to suspend or revoke will be made before that time.
