(1) No more than twenty percent of the total amount of liquid bituminous asphalt paving material used shall be cutback asphalt; and

(2) No more than 2,615,000 gallons of cutback asphalts shall be used, of which no more than 1,400,000 gallons may be used for dust palliative work on roadways and shoulders; and

(3) No more than 2,500,000 gallons total of emulsion Class E-4 and Class E-5 shall be used unless an equivalent reduction in the use of cutbacks is made to balance the additional hydrocarbon emissions from emulsions.

(b) The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is required to submit to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, on a quarterly basis, reports which list for each of the affected counties the number of gallons of each class of asphalt used. The first quarterly reports will be submitted in October 1977 for the period between July 1, 1977, and September 30, 1977. Copies of all reports will also be forwarded to Region III, EPA.
