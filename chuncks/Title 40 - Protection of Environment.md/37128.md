###### Transfer Systems
####### § 63.7915 What emissions limitations and work practice standards must I meet for transfer systems?
######## e.g.

(2) A transfer system that consists of continuous hard piping. All joints or seams between the pipe sections must be permanently or semi-permanently sealed (, a welded joint between two sections of metal pipe or a bolted and gasketed flange).

(3) A transfer system that is enclosed and vented through a closed vent system to a control device according to the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(i) The transfer system is designed and operated such that an internal pressure in the vapor headspace in the enclosure is maintained at a level less than atmospheric pressure when the control device is operating, and

(ii) The closed vent system and control device are designed and operated to meet the emissions limitations and work practice standards in § 63.7925 that apply to your closed vent system and control device.

(d) As provided in § 63.6(g), you may request approval from the EPA to use an alternative to the work practice standards in this section that apply to your transfer systems. If you request for permission to use an alternative to the work practice standards, you must submit the information described in § 63.6(g)(2).
