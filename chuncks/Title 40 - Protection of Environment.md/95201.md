###### § 790.85 Submission of equivalence data.

If EPA requires in a test rule promulgated under section 4 of the Act the testing of two or more test substances which are forms of the same chemical, each exemption applicant must submit the following data:

(a) The chemical identity of each technical-grade chemical substance or mixture manufactured and/or processed by the applicant for which the exemption is sought. The exact type of identifying data required will be specified in the test rule, but may include all characteristics and properties of the applicant's substance or mixture, such as boiling point, melting point, chemical analysis (including identification and amount of impurities), additives, spectral data, and other physical or chemical information that may be relevant in determining whether the applicant's substance or mixture is equivalent to the specific test substance.

(b) The basis for the applicant's belief that the substance or mixture is equivalent to the test substance or mixture.

(c) Any other data which exemption applicants are directed to submit in the test rule which may bear on a determination of equivalence. This may include a description of the process by which each technical-grade chemical substance or mixture for which an exemption is sought is manufactured or processed prior to use or distribution in commerce by the applicant.
