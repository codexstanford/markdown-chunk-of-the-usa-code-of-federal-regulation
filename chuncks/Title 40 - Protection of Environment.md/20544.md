####### § 60.2810 What is an air curtain incinerator?

(a) An ACI operates by forcefully projecting a curtain of air across an open chamber or open pit in which combustion occurs. Incinerators of this type can be constructed above or below ground and with or without refractory walls and floor. Air curtain incinerators are not to be confused with conventional combustion devices with enclosed fireboxes and controlled air technology such as mass burn, modular, and fluidized bed combustors.

(b) Air curtain incinerators that burn only the materials listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section are only required to meet the requirements under § 60.2805 and under "Air Curtain Incinerators" (§§ 60.2810 through 60.2870):

(1) 100 percent wood waste;

(2) 100 percent clean lumber; and

(3) 100 percent mixture of only wood waste, clean lumber, and/or yard waste.
