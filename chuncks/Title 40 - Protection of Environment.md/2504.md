###### Managing Your TAG
####### § 35.4180 Must my group keep financial records after we finish our TAG?

(a) You must keep TAG financial records for ten years from the date of the final Financial Status Report, or until any audit, litigation, cost recovery, and/or disputes initiated before the end of the ten-year retention period are settled, whichever, is longer.

(b) At the ten-year mark, you may dispose of your TAG financial records if you first get written approval from EPA.

(c) If you prefer, you may submit the financial records to EPA for safekeeping when you give us the final Financial Status Report.
