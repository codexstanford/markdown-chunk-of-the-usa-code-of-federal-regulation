###### § 142.42 Consideration of a variance request.

(a) The Administrator shall act on any variance request submitted pursuant to § 142.41 within 90 days of receipt of the request.

(b) In his consideration of whether the public water system is unable to comply with a contaminant level required by the national primary drinking water regulations because of the nature of the raw water source, the Administrator shall consider such factors as the following:

(1) The availability and effectiveness of treatment methods for the contaminant for which the variance is requested.

(2) Cost and other economic considerations such as implementing treatment, improving the quality of the source water or using an alternate source.

(c) A variance may be issued to a public water system on the condition that the public water system install the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means, which the Administrator finds are available (taking costs into consideration) and based upon an evaluation satisfactory to the Administrator that indicates that alternative sources of water are not reasonably available to the public water system.

(d) In his consideration of whether a public water system should be granted a variance to a required treatment technique because such treatment is unnecessary to protect the public health, the Administrator shall consider such factors as the following:

(1) Quality of the water source including water quality data and pertinent sources of pollution.

(2) Source protection measures employed by the public water system.
