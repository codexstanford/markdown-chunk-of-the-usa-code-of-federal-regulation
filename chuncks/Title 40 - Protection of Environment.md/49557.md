############### § 97.142 CAIR NOallowance allocations.

(a)(1) The baseline heat input (in mmBtu) used with respect to CAIR NOallowance allocations under paragraph (b) of this section for each CAIR NOunit will be:

(i) For units commencing operation before January 1, 2001 the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's adjusted control period heat input for 2000 through 2004, with the adjusted control period heat input for each year calculated as follows:

(A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 100 percent;

(B) If the unit is oil-fired during the year, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 60 percent; and

(C) If the unit is not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 40 percent.

(ii) For units commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001 and operating each calendar year during a period of 5 or more consecutive calendar years, the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's total converted control period heat input over the first such 5 years.

(2)(i) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as coal-fired or oil-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and a unit's total tons of NOemissions during a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, to the extent the unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the year, or will be based on the best available data reported to the Administrator for the unit (in a format prescribed by the Administrator), to the extent the unit was not otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the year.

(ii) A unit's converted control period heat input for a calendar year specified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section equals:

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, the control period gross electrical output of the generator or generators served by the unit multiplied by 7,900 Btu/kWh, if the unit is coal-fired for the year, or 6,675 Btu/kWh, if the unit is not coal-fired for the year, and divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu, provided that if a generator is served by 2 or more units, then the gross electrical output of the generator will be attributed to each unit in proportion to the unit's share of the total control period heat input of such units for the year;

(B) For a unit that is a boiler and has equipment used to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by the boiler during the control period, divided by 0.8 and by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu; or

(C) For a unit that is a combustion turbine and has equipment used to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the control period gross electrical output of the enclosed device comprising the compressor, combustor, and turbine multiplied by 3,413 Btu/kWh, plus the total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by any associated heat recovery steam generator during the control period divided by 0.8, and with the sum divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu.

(iii) Gross electrical output and total heat energy under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section will be determined based on the best available data reported to the Administrator for the unit (in a format prescribed by the Administrator).

(3) The Administrator will determine what data are the best available data under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by weighing the likelihood that data are accurate and reliable and giving greater weight to data submitted to a governmental entity in compliance with legal requirements or substantiated by an independent entity.

(b)(1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the Administrator will allocate to all CAIR NOunits in a State that have a baseline heat input (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) a total amount of CAIR NOallowances equal to 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the tons of NOemissions in the applicable State trading budget under § 97.140 (except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).

(2) The Administrator will allocate CAIR NOallowances to each CAIR NOunit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in an amount determined by multiplying the total amount of CAIR NOallowances allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the ratio of the baseline heat input of such CAIR NOunit to the total amount of baseline heat input of all such CAIR NOunits in the State and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(c) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the Administrator will allocate CAIR NOallowances to CAIR NOunits in a State that are not allocated CAIR NOallowances under paragraph (b) of this section because the units do not yet have a baseline heat input under paragraph (a) of this section or because the units have a baseline heat input but all CAIR NOallowances available under paragraph (b) of this section for the control period are already allocated, in accordance with the following procedures:

(1) The Administrator will establish a separate new unit set-aside for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated CAIR NOallowances equal to 5 percent for a control period in 2009 through 2014, and 3 percent for a control period in 2015 and thereafter, of the amount of tons of NOemissions in the applicable State trading budget under § 97.140.

(2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NOunit may submit to the Administrator a request, in a format specified by the Administrator, to be allocated CAIR NOallowances, starting with the later of the control period in 2009 or the first control period after the control period in which the CAIR NOunit commences commercial operation and until the first control period for which the unit is allocated CAIR NOallowances under paragraph (b) of this section. A separate CAIR NOallowance allocation request for each control period for which CAIR NOallowances are sought must be submitted on or before May 1 of such control period and after the date on which the CAIR NOunit commences commercial operation.

(3) In a CAIR NOallowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated representative may request for a control period CAIR NOallowances in an amount not exceeding the CAIR NOunit's total tons of NOemissions during the calendar year immediately before such control period.

(4) The Administrator will review each CAIR NOallowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and will allocate CAIR NOallowances for each control period pursuant to such request as follows:

(i) The Administrator will accept an allowance allocation request only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the Administrator as necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section.

(ii) On or after May 1 of the control period, the Administrator will determine the sum of the CAIR NOallowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) in all allowance allocation requests accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section for the control period.

(iii) If the amount of CAIR NOallowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or equal to the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Administrator will allocate the amount of CAIR NOallowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) to each CAIR NOunit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.

(iv) If the amount of CAIR NOallowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Administrator will allocate to each CAIR NOunit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section the amount of the CAIR NOallowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), multiplied by the amount of CAIR NOallowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period, divided by the sum determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(v) The Administrator will notify each CAIR designated representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the amount of CAIR NOallowances (if any) allocated for the control period to the CAIR NOunit covered by the request.

(d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragraph (c)(4) of this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NOallowances remain in the new unit set-aside under paragraph (c) of this section for a State for the control period, the Administrator will allocate to each CAIR NOunit that was allocated CAIR NOallowances under paragraph (b) of this section in the State an amount of CAIR NOallowances equal to the total amount of such remaining unallocated CAIR NOallowances, multiplied by the unit's allocation under paragraph (b) of this section, divided by 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the amount of tons of NOemissions in the applicable State trading budget under § 97.140, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(e) If the Administrator determines that CAIR NOallowances were allocated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, or paragraph (d) of this section for a control period and that the recipient of the allocation is not actually a CAIR NOunit under § 97.104 in such control period, then the Administrator will notify the CAIR designated representative and will act in accordance with the following procedures:

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section, the Administrator will not record such CAIR NOallowances under § 97.153.

(2) If the Administrator already recorded such CAIR NOallowances under § 97.153 and if the Administrator makes such determination before making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.154(b) for the control period, then the Administrator will deduct from the account in which such CAIR NOallowances were recorded under § 97.153 an amount of CAIR NOallowances allocated for the same or a prior control period equal to the amount of such already recorded CAIR NOallowances. The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that there are sufficient CAIR NOallowances in such account for completion of the deduction.

(3) If the Administrator already recorded such CAIR NOallowances under § 97.153 and if the Administrator makes such determination after making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.154(b) for the control period, then the Administrator will apply paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate, to any subsequent control period for which CAIR NOallowances were allocated to such recipient.

(4) The Administrator will transfer the CAIR NOallowances that are not recorded, or that are deducted, in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section to a new unit set-aside for the State in which such recipient is located.
