####### § 63.3174 What are the requirements for a capture system or add-on control device which is not taken into account when demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission limitations?

You may have capture systems or add-on control devices which you choose not to take into account when demonstrating compliance with the applicable emission limitations. For any such capture system or add-on control device, you are not required to comply with the requirements of §§ 63.3093, 63.3100, 63.3110, 63.3120, 63.3130, 63.3131, and 63.3160 through 63.3168 with regard to notification, reporting, recordkeeping, performance tests, monitoring, operating parameters, capture efficiency, add-on control device efficiency, destruction efficiency, or removal efficiency. If, at a later date, you decide to take any such capture system or add-on control device into account when demonstrating compliance with the emission limitations, then at that time you must comply with the requirements of §§ 63.3093, 63.3100, 63.3110, 63.3120, 63.3130, 63.3131, and 63.3160 through 63.3168 with regard to notification, reporting, recordkeeping, performance tests, monitoring, operating parameters, capture efficiency, add-on control device efficiency, destruction efficiency, and removal efficiency, as applicable, for that capture system or add-on control device.
