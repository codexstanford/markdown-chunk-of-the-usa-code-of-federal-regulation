####### § 60.4217 What emission standards must I meet if I am an owner or operator of a stationary internal combustion engine using special fuels?

Owners and operators of stationary CI ICE that do not use diesel fuel may petition the Administrator for approval of alternative emission standards, if they can demonstrate that they use a fuel that is not the fuel on which the manufacturer of the engine certified the engine and that the engine cannot meet the applicable standards required in § 60.4204 or § 60.4205 using such fuels and that use of such fuel is appropriate and reasonably necessary, considering cost, energy, technical feasibility, human health and environmental, and other factors, for the operation of the engine.
