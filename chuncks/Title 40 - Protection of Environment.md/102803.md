(4) If the sample is not passed through a dryer during this verification test, measure the HO mole fraction,, of the humidified COtest gas as close as possible to the inlet of the analyzer. For example, measure dewpoint,, and absolute pressure,, to calculate. Verify that the HO content meets the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the sample is passed through a dryer during this verification test, you must verify that the HO content of the humidified test gas downstream of the vessel meets the requirement in paragraph (d)(2) of this section based on either direct measurement of the HO content (e.g., dewpoint and pressure) or an estimate based on the vessel pressure and temperature. Use good engineering judgment to estimate the HO content. For example, you may use previous direct measurements of HO content to verify the vessel's level of saturation.
