(3) The extent to which the project uses new or innovative approaches such as the use of energy efficient parts and systems, or the use of renewable or alternate sources of energy; green infrastructure; and the development of alternate sources of drinking water through desalination, aquifer recharge or water recycling;

(4) The extent to which the project protects against extreme weather events, such as floods or hurricanes, as well as the impacts of climate change;

(5) The extent to which the project helps maintain or protect the environment or public health;

(6) The extent to which a project serves regions with significant energy exploration, development, or production areas;

(7) The extent to which a project serves regions with significant water resource challenges, including the need to address water quality concerns in areas of regional, national, or international significance; water quantity concerns related to groundwater, surface water, or other resources; significant flood risk; water resource challenges identified in existing regional, state, or multistate agreements; and water resources with exceptional recreational value or ecological importance;

(8) The extent to which the project addresses identified municipal, state, or regional priorities;

(9) The readiness of the project to proceed toward development, including a demonstration by the obligor that there is a reasonable expectation that the contracting process for construction of the project can commence by not later than 90 days after the date on which a Federal credit instrument is obligated for the project under this subtitle; and

(10) The extent to which the project financing plan includes public or private financing in addition to assistance under this subtitle;
