###### § 98.283 Calculating GHG emissions.

You must calculate and report the combined annual process COemissions from all silicon carbide process units and production furnaces using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined annual process COemissions by operating and maintaining CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined annual process COemissions using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

(1) Use Equation BB-1 of this section to calculate the facility-specific emissions factor for determining COemissions. The carbon content must be measured monthly and used to calculate a monthly COemissions factor:

(2) Calculate annual COprocess emissions from the silicon carbide production facility according to Equation BB-2 of this section:

(c) If GHG emissions from a silicon carbide production furnace or process unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports COemissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.
