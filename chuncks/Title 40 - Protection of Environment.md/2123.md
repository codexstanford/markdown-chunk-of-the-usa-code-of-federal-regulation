###### § 35.2105 Debarment and suspension.

The applicant shall indicate whether it used the services of any individual, organization, or unit of government for facilities planning or design work whose name appears on the master list of debarments, suspensions, and voluntary exclusions. See 2 CFR 200.214 and 2 CFR part 1532. If the applicant indicates it has used the services of a debarred individual or firm, EPA will closely examine the facilities plan, design drawings and specifications to determine whether to award a grant. EPA will also determine whether the applicant should be found non-responsible under 2 CFR parts 200 and 1500 or be the subject of possible debarment or suspension under 2 CFR part 1532.
