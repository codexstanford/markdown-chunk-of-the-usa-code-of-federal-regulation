###### § 790.42 Persons subject to a test rule.

(a) Each test rule described in § 790.40 will specify whether manufacturers, processors, or both are subject to the requirement for testing of the subject chemical under section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act and will indicate who will be required to submit letters of intent to conduct testing.

(1) If testing is being required to allow evaluation of risks:

(i) Primarily associated with manufacture of the chemical, or

(ii) Associated with both manufacturer and processing of the chemical, or

(iii) Associated with distribution in commerce, use, and/or disposal activities concerning the chemical, each manufacturer of the chemical will be subject and must comply with the requirements of the test rule.

(2) While legally subject to the test rule in circumstances described in paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section, processors of the chemical must comply with the requirements of the test rule only if processors are directed to do so in a subsequent notice as set forth in § 790.48(b).

(3) If testing is being required to allow evaluation of risks associated solely with processing of the chemical, processors will be subject and must comply with the requirements of the test rule.

(4) While legally subject to the test rule in circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, persons who manufacture less than 500 kg (1,100 lb) of the chemical annually during the period from the effective date of the test rule to the end of the reimbursement period, must comply with the requirements of the test rule only if such manufacturers are directed to do so in a subsequent notice as set forth in § 790.48, or if directed to do so in a particular test rule.

(5) While legally subject to the test rule in circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, persons who manufacture small quantities of the chemical solely for research and development (meaning quantities that are not greater than those necessary for purposes of scientific experimentation or analysis or chemical research on, or analysis of, such chemical or another chemical, including such research or analysis for development of a product) from the effective date of the test rule to the end of the reimbursement period, must comply with the requirements of the test rule only if such manufacturers are directed to do so in subsequent notice set forth in § 790.48, or if directed to do so in a particular test rule.

(6) If testing is being required to allow evaluation of risks associated primarily with manufacture of a chemical for research and development (R & D) purposes, manufacturers of the chemical for R & D will be subject and must comply with the requirements of the test rule.
