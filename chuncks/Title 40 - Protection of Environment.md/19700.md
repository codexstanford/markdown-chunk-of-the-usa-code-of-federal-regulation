###### § 60.735 Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

(a) Records of the measurements required in § 60.734 of this subpart shall be retained for at least 2 years.

(b) Each owner or operator who uses a wet scrubber to comply with § 60.732 shall determine and record once each day, from the recordings of the monitoring devices in § 60.734(d), an arithmetic average over a 2-hour period of both the change in pressure of the gas stream across the scrubber and the flowrate of the scrubbing liquid.

(c) Each owner or operator shall submit written reports semiannually of exceedances of control device operating parameters required to be monitored by § 60.734 of this subpart. For the purpose of these reports, exceedances are defined as follows:

(1) All 6-minute periods during which the average opacity from dry control devices is greater than 10 percent; or

(2) Any daily 2-hour average of the wet scrubber pressure drop determined as described in § 60.735(b) that is less than 90 percent of the average value recorded according to § 60.736(c) during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance with the particulate matter standard; or

(3) Each daily wet scrubber liquid flow rate recorded as described in § 60.735(b) that is less than 80 percent or greater than 120 percent of the average value recorded according to § 60.736(c) during the most recent performance test that demonstrated compliance with the particulate matter standard.

(d) The requirements of this section remain in force until and unless the Agency, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Clean Air Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected facilities within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this section provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.
