(a) If you plan to close your municipal waste combustion unit rather than comply with this subpart, you must submit a closure notification, including the date of closure, to the Administrator by the date your final control plan is due.

(b) If the closure date is later than 1 year after the effective date of this subpart, you must enter into a legally binding closure agreement with the Administrator by the date your final control plan is due. The agreement must include two items:

(1) The date by which operation will cease. The closure date can be no later than the applicable final compliance date in table 1 of this subpart.

(2) For Class I units only, dioxins/furans stack test results for at least one test conducted during or after 1990. The stack tests must have been conducted according to the procedures specified under § 62.15245.
