###### § 1068.615 Request for hearing - denied application for certification, automatically suspended certificate, and determinations related to certification.

(a) You may request an informal hearing as described in § 1068.650 if we deny your application for a certificate of conformity, if your certificate of conformity is automatically suspended under the regulations, or if you disagree with determinations we make as part of the certification process. For example, you might disagree with our determinations regarding adjustable parameters under § 1068.50 or regarding your good engineering judgment under § 1068.5.

(b) You must send your hearing request in writing to the Designated Compliance Officer no later than 30 days after we notify you of our decision, or by some later deadline we specify. If the specified deadline passes, we may nevertheless grant you a hearing at our discretion.

(c) Your hearing request must include the information specified in § 1068.610(d).

(d) We will approve your request for an informal hearing if we find that your request raises a substantial factual issue in the decision we made that, if addressed differently, could alter the outcome of that decision.
