(a) Subchapter 18 of the New Jersey Administrative Code, entitled, "Control and Prohibitions of Air Pollution from Ambient Air Quality in Nonattainment Areas (Emission Offset Rule)," N.J.A.C. 7:27-18.1as submitted to EPA on August 5, 1980 by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, is approved for the entire State of New Jersey, with the following provisions:

(1) The definition of "significant emission increase" as it appears in section 7:27-18.1, entitled, "Definitions," is disapproved. The following definition of "significant emission increase" is applicable: "An increase, since December 21, 1976, in the rate of allowable emissions, including fugitive pollutant emissions, at a facility of any criteria pollutant greater than or equal to 50 tons per year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour, not including decreases in the rates of allowable emissions except where such decreases are contemporaneous with emission increases. The increase in the rates of allowable emissions shall be the cumulative total of increases from all new or altered equipment for which permits have been issued on or after December 21, 1976 and for which permit applications have been received by the Department, and the fugitive emissions associated with that equipment. The hourly and daily rates shall apply only with respect to a pollutant for which a national ambient air quality standard for a period not exceeding 24 hours has been established.

(2) Subsection (e)(1) under section 7:27-18.2, entitled, "General Provisions," is disapproved and replaced with the following: "The requirements of paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(4), and (c)(5) of this section shall again become applicable when proposed new construction or alterations at the facility would cause the increase in the rate of allowable emissions of that criteria pollutant to again exceed 50 tons per year, 1,000 pounds per day, or 100 pounds per hour whichever is most restrictive. The accumulation of increases in the rate of allowable emissions shall resume from zero after each application of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section."
