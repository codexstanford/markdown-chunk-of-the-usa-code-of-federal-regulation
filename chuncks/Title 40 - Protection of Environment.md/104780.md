###### § 1090.1120 PTD requirements for diesel fuel additives.

In addition to any other PTD requirements in this subpart, on each occasion when any person transfers custody or title to a diesel fuel additive that is subject to the provisions of § 1090.310 to a party in the additive distribution system or in the diesel fuel distribution system for use downstream of the diesel fuel manufacturing facility, the transferor must provide to the transferee PTDs that include the following information:

(a) For diesel fuel additives that comply with the sulfur standard in § 1090.310(a), the following statement: "The sulfur content of this diesel fuel additive does not exceed 15 ppm."

(b) For diesel fuel additives that meet the requirements in § 1090.310(b), the transferor must provide to the transferee PTDs that identify the additive as such, and comply with all the following:

(1) Indicate the high sulfur potential of the diesel fuel additive by including the following statement: "This diesel fuel additive may exceed the federal 15 ppm sulfur standard. Improper use of this additive may result in non-compliant diesel fuel."

(2) If the diesel fuel additive package contains a static dissipater additive or red dye having a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm, one of the following statements must be included that accurately describes the contents of the additive package:

(i) "This diesel fuel additive contains a static dissipater additive having a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm."

(ii) "This diesel fuel additive contains red dye having a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm."

(iii) "This diesel fuel additive contains a static dissipater additive and red dye having a sulfur content greater than 15 ppm."

(3) Include the following information:

(i) The diesel fuel additive package's maximum sulfur concentration.

(ii) The maximum recommended concentration for use of the diesel fuel additive package in diesel fuel, in volume percent.

(iii) The contribution to the sulfur content of the fuel (in ppm) that would result if the diesel fuel additive package is used at the maximum recommended concentration.

(c) For diesel fuel additives that are sold in containers for use by the ultimate consumer of diesel fuel, each transferor must display on the additive container, in a legible and conspicuous manner, one of the following statements, as applicable:

(1) For diesel fuel additives that comply with the sulfur standard in § 1090.310(a): "This diesel fuel additive complies with the federal low sulfur content requirements for use in diesel motor vehicles and nonroad engines."

(2) For diesel fuel additives that do not comply with the sulfur standard in § 1090.310(a), the following statement: "This diesel fuel additive does not comply with federal ultra-low sulfur content requirements."
