(b) A description (including organization charts) of the organization and structure of the State agency or agencies which will have responsibility for administering the program. If more than one agency is responsible for administration of a program, the responsibilities of each agency, and their procedures for coordination must be set forth, and an agency must be designated as a "lead agency" (, the "State sludge management agency") to facilitate communications between EPA and the State agencies having program responsibility. If the State proposes to administer a program of greater scope of coverage than is required by federal law, the information provided under this paragraph must indicate the resources dedicated to administering the federally required portion of the program. This description must include:

(1) A description of the general duties and the total number of State agency staff carrying out the State program;

(2) An itemization of the estimated costs of establishing and administering the program for the first two years after approval including cost of the personnel described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, cost of administrative support, and cost of technical support, except where a State is seeking authorization for an established sewage sludge management program that has been in existence for a minimum of two years and is at least as stringent as the program for which the State is seeking authorization; and

(3) An estimate of the sources and amounts of funding for the first two years after approval to meet the costs listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, except where a State is seeking authorization for an established sewage sludge management program that has been in existence for a minimum of two years and is at least as stringent as the program for which the State is seeking authorization.

(c) A description of applicable State procedures, including permitting procedures, and any State administrative or judicial review procedures.

(d) Copies of the permit, application, and reporting forms or a description of the procedures the State intends to employ for obtaining information needed to implement its permitting program.

(e) A complete description of the State's compliance tracking and enforcement program (see 40 CFR 501.16 and 501.17).

(f)(1) An inventory of all POTWs and other TWTDS that are subject to regulations promulgated pursuant to 40 CFR part 503 and subject to the State program, which includes:

(i) Name, location, and ownership status (e.g., public, private, federal),

(ii) Sludge use or disposal practice(s),

(iii) Annual sludge production volume, and

(iv) Permit numbers for permits containing sewage sludge requirements, if any, and;

(v) Compliance status.

(2) States may submit either:

(i) Inventories which contain all of the information required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section; or

(ii) A partial inventory with a detailed plan showing how the State will complete the required inventory within five years after approval of its sludge management program under this part.

(g) In the case of Indian Tribes eligible under § 501.24(b), if a State has been authorized by EPA to issue permits on the Federal Indian reservation in accordance with § 501.13, a description of how responsibility for pending permit applications, existing permits, and supporting files will be transferred from the State to the eligible Indian Tribe. To the maximum extent practicable, this should include a Memorandum of Agreement negotiated between the State and the Indian Tribe addressing the arrangements for such transfer.
