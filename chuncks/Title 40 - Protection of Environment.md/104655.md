##### Subpart H - Averaging, Banking, and Trading Provisions
###### § 1090.735 Invalid credits and remedial actions.

For credits that have been calculated or generated improperly, or are otherwise determined to be invalid, all the following provisions apply:

(a) Invalid credits must not be used to achieve compliance with an average standard under this part, regardless of the good faith belief that the credits were validly generated.

(b) Any validly generated credits existing in the transferring gasoline manufacturer's credit balance after correcting the credit balance, and after the transferor applies credits as needed to meet the average standard at the end of the compliance period, must first be applied to correct the invalid transfers before the transferring gasoline manufacturer trades or banks the credits.

(c) The gasoline manufacturer that used the credits, and any transferor of the credits, must adjust their credit records, reports, and average standard compliance calculations as necessary to reflect the use of valid credits only. Updates to any reports must be done in accordance with subpart J of this part using forms and procedures specified by EPA.
