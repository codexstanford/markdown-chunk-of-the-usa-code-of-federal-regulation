###### § 270.26 Special part B information requirements for drip pads.

Except as otherwise provided by § 264.1 of this chapter, owners and operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facilities that collect, store, or treat hazardous waste on drip pads must provide the following additional information:

(a) A list of hazardous wastes placed or to be placed on each drip pad.

(b) If an exemption is sought to subpart F of part 264 of this chapter, as provided by § 264.90 of this chapter, detailed plans and an engineering report describing how the requirements of § 264.90(b)(2) of this chapter will be met.

(c) Detailed plans and an engineering report describing how the drip pad is or will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to meet the requirements of § 264.573 of this chapter, including the as-built drawings and specifications. This submission must address the following items as specified in § 264.571 of this chapter:

(1) The design characteristics of the drip pad;

(2) The liner system;

(3) The leakage detection system, including the leak detection system and how it is designed to detect the failure of the drip pad or the presence of any releases of hazardous waste or accumulated liquid at the earliest practicable time;

(4) Practices designed to maintain drip pads;

(5) The associated collection system;

(6) Control of run-on to the drip pad;

(7) Control of run-off from the drip pad;

(8) The interval at which drippage and other materials will be removed from the associated collection system and a statement demonstrating that the interval will be sufficient to prevent overflow onto the drip pad;

(9) Procedures for cleaning the drip pad at least once every seven days to ensure the removal of any accumulated residues of waste or other materials, including but not limited to rinsing, washing with detergents or other appropriate solvents, or steam cleaning and provisions for documenting the date, time, and cleaning procedure used each time the pad is cleaned.

(10) Operating practices and procedures that will be followed to ensure that tracking of hazardous waste or waste constituents off the drip pad due to activities by personnel or equipment is minimized;

(11) Procedures for ensuring that, after removal from the treatment vessel, treated wood from pressure and non-pressure processes is held on the drip pad until drippage has ceased, including recordkeeping practices;

(12) Provisions for ensuring that collection and holding units associated with the run-on and run-off control systems are emptied or otherwise managed as soon as possible after storms to maintain design capacity of the system;

(13) If treatment is carried out on the drip pad, details of the process equipment used, and the nature and quality of the residuals.

(14) A description of how each drip pad, including appurtenances for control of run-on and run-off, will be inspected in order to meet the requirements of § 264.573 of this chapter. This information should be included in the inspection plan submitted under § 270.14(b)(5) of this part.

(15) A certification signed by a qualified Professional Engineer, stating that the drip pad design meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (f) of § 264.573 of this chapter.

(16) A description of how hazardous waste residues and contaminated materials will be removed from the drip pad at closure, as required under § 264.575(a) of this chapter. For any waste not to be removed from the drip pad upon closure, the owner or operator must submit detailed plans and an engineering report describing how § 264.310 (a) and (b) of this chapter will be complied with. This information should be included in the closure plan and, where applicable, the post-closure plan submitted under § 270.14(b)(13).
