####### § 49.4183 Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) Each owner or operator of an oil and natural gas source as identified in § 49.4169(b) must maintain the following records, as applicable:

(1) Monthly calculations, as specified in § 49.4173(c)(2), demonstrating that the uncontrolled actual VOC emissions from the collection of all storage vessels, glycol dehydrators, and pneumatic pumps at an oil and natural gas source, as identified in § 49.4169(b), have been maintained at less than 4 tpy;

(2) Records of monthly and rolling 12-month crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, produced water or natural gas throughput;

(3) For each emergency storage vessel that is exempted from the control requirements of § 49.4173(b)(2), records of usage including:

(i) The date the vessel received fluids;

(ii) The volume of fluids received in barrels;

(iii) The date the overflow vessel was emptied; and

(iv) The volume of fluids emptied in barrels.

(4) Identification of each storage vessel that is removed from service or returned to service as specified in § 49.4173(b)(3), including the date the storage vessel was removed from service or returned to service.

(5) For storage vessels that are skid-mounted or permanently attached to something that is mobile (such as trucks, railcars, barges or ships), records indicating the number of consecutive days that the vessel is located at an oil and natural gas source. If a storage vessel is removed from an oil and natural gas source and, within 30 days, is either returned to the source or replaced by another storage vessel at the source to serve the same or similar function, then the entire period since the original storage vessel was first located at the source, including the days when the storage vessel was removed, must be added to the count of the number of consecutive days.

(6) For each enclosed combustor or flare at an oil and natural gas source required under §§ 49.4173 through 49.4177:

(i) Manufacturer-written, site-specific designs, operating instructions, operating procedures and maintenance schedules, including those of any operation monitoring systems;

(ii) Date of installation;

(iii) Records of required monitoring of operations in § 49.4182(d)(1);

(iv) Records of any instances in which the pilot flame is not present or the monitoring equipment is not functioning in the enclosed combustor or flare, the date and times of the occurrence, the corrective actions taken, and any preventative measures adopted to prevent recurrence of the occurrence; and

(v) Records of any visible emissions tests conducted according to § 49.4182(d)(3), including any time periods in which visible smoke emissions are observed emanating from the enclosed combustor or flare.

(7) For each closed-vent system:

(i) The date of installation; and

(ii) Records of any instances in which any closed-vent system or control device was bypassed or down, the reason for each incident, its duration, and the corrective actions taken, and any preventative measures adopted to avoid such bypasses or downtimes.

(8) Documentation of all storage vessel and closed-vent system inspections required in § 49.4182(c). All inspection records must include the following information:

(i) The date of the inspection;

(ii) The findings of the inspection;

(iii) Any adjustments or repairs made as a result of the inspection, and the date of the adjustment or repair; and

(iv) The inspector's name or identification number;

(9) The Uinta Basin-wide fugitive emissions monitoring plan for the Indian country lands within the U&O Reservation, including all elements required by § 49.4178(d).

(10) Documentation of each fugitive emissions inspection conducted in accordance with § 49.4178(d). All inspection records must include the following information:

(i) The date of the inspection;

(ii) The identification of any component that was determined to be leaking;

(iii) The identification of any component designated difficult-to-monitor or unsafe-to-monitor that was not inspected, and the reason it was not inspected;

(iv) The date of the first attempt to repair the leaking component;

(v) The identification of any leaking component with a delayed repair and the reason for the delayed repair:

(A) For unavailable parts:
