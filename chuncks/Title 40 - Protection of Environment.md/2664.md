####### § 35.6145 Eligibility for enforcement Cooperative Agreements.

Pursuant to CERCLA section 104(d), States, political subdivisions thereof, and Indian Tribes may apply for enforcement Cooperative Agreements. To be eligible for an enforcement Cooperative Agreement, the State, political subdivision or Indian Tribe must demonstrate that it has the authority, jurisdiction, and the necessary administrative capabilities to take an enforcement action(s) to compel PRP cleanup of the site, or recovery of the cleanup costs. To accomplish this, the State, political subdivision or Indian Tribe, respectively, must submit the following for EPA approval:

(a) A letter from the State Attorney General, or comparable local official (of a political subdivision) or comparable Indian Tribal official, certifying that it has the authority, jurisdiction, and administrative capabilities that provide a basis for pursuing enforcement actions against a PRP to secure the necessary response;

(b) A copy of the applicable State, local (political subdivision) or Indian Tribal statute(s) and a description of how it is implemented;

(c) Any other documentation required by EPA to demonstrate that the State, local (political subdivision) or Indian Tribal government has the statutory authority, jurisdiction, and administrative capabilities to perform the enforcement activity(ies) to be funded under the Cooperative Agreement.
