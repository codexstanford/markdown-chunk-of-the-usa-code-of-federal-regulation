###### Process Vents
####### § 63.7890 What emissions limitations and work practice standards must I meet for process vents?

(a) You must control HAP emissions from each new and existing process vent subject to § 63.7885(b)(1) according to emissions limitations and work practice standards in this section that apply to your affected process vents.

(b) For your affected process vents, you must meet one of the facility-wide emission limit options specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. If you have multiple affected process vent streams, you may comply with this paragraph using a combination of controlled and uncontrolled process vent streams that achieve the facility-wide emission limit that applies to you.

(1) Reduce from all affected process vents the total emissions of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart to a level less than 1.4 kilograms per hour (kg/hr) and 2.8 Mg/yr (3.0 pounds per hour (lb/hr) and 3.1 tpy); or

(2) Reduce from all affected process vents the emissions of total organic compounds (TOC) (minus methane and ethane) to a level below 1.4 kg/hr and 2.8 Mg/yr (3.0 lb/hr and 3.1 tpy); or

(3) Reduce from all affected process vents the total emissions of the HAP listed in Table 1 of this subpart by 95 percent by weight or more; or

(4) Reduce from all affected process vents the emissions of TOC (minus methane and ethane) by 95 percent by weight or more.

(c) For each closed vent system and control device you use to comply with paragraph (b) of this section, you must meet the operating limit requirements and work practice standards in § 63.7925(c) through (j) that apply to your closed vent system and control device.
