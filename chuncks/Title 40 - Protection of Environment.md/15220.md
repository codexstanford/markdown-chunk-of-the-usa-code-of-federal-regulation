(55) On January 28, 1985, Wisconsin submitted its Rothschild (Marathon County) SOplan, which contains emission limits for sources in the City of Rothschild and the Town of Weston, specifically for the Weyerhaeuser Paper Company and the Reed-Lignin Company, respectively. USEPA is approving NR 418.08 because this revision meets the requirements of part D of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7501-7508. The Wisconsin SIP, however, contains additional existing requirements for SO. Today's action on NR 418.08 has been integrated within Wisconsin's existing SIP regulations, and does not eliminate a source's obligation to comply with all existing SOSIP requirements. Specifically, today's action in no way affects the terms and conditions of a Federal Consent Decree entered into by USEPA and the Weyerhaeuser Company located in Rothschild, Wisconsin No. 89-C-0973-C (W.D. Wis., filed November 1, 1989). This Consent Decree resolves USEPA's enforcement action against Weyerhaeuser Company for violations of SIP rule NR 154.12(1) (now recodified as 418.08). In that Decree, Weyerhaeuser committed to comply with NR 154.12(1) by installing a desulfurization scrubber. August 15, 1989, the WDNR issued a construction permit to Weyerhaeuser which limit the combined emissions of Weyerhaeuser's acid plant and desulfurization scrubber to 28 pounds of SOper hour. The conditions and terms of this construction permit and of the Consent Decree remain federally enforceable. On May 9, 1987, 18 months past the effective date of USEPA's designation of Marathon County as a primary SOnon-attainment area (October 9, 1985, (50 FR 41139)), a construction moratorium was imposed in Marathon County under section 110(a)(2)(I) of the Clean Air Act because the county did not have a USEPA approved plan which assured the attainment and maintenance of the SONAAQS. However, USEPA final approval of Rothschild's SOSIP will lift the section 110(a)(2)(I) construction ban in Marathon County.
