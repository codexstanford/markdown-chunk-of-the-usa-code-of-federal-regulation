##### Subpart H - Averaging, Banking, and Trading for Certification
###### § 1036.710 Averaging.

(a) Averaging is the exchange of emission credits among your engine families. You may average emission credits only within the same averaging set, except as specified in § 1036.740.

(b) You may certify one or more engine families to an FEL/FCL above the applicable standard, subject to any applicable FEL caps and other the provisions in subpart B of this part, if you show in your application for certification that your projected balance of all emission-credit transactions in that model year is greater than or equal to zero, or that a negative balance is allowed under § 1036.745.

(c) If you certify an engine family to an FEL/FCL that exceeds the otherwise applicable standard, you must obtain enough emission credits to offset the engine family's deficit by the due date for the final report required in § 1036.730. The emission credits used to address the deficit may come from your other engine families that generate emission credits in the same model year (or from later model years as specified in § 1036.745), from emission credits you have banked, or from emission credits you obtain through trading.
