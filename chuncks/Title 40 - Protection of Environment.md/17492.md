(i) Documentation of the analyses undertaken to support the need for an extension, including an explanation of why up to 3 years after EPA approval of the State plan is sufficient time to comply with the State plan while 1 year after EPA approval of the State plan is not sufficient. The documentation shall also include an evaluation of the option to transport the waste offsite to a commercial medical waste treatment and disposal facility on a temporary or permanent basis; and

(ii) Documentation of measurable and enforceable incremental steps of progress to be taken towards compliance with the emission guidelines.

(2) Include procedures for granting or denying the extension; and

(3) If an extension is granted, require expeditious compliance with the emissions guidelines on or before the date 3 years after EPA approval of the state plan (but not later than September 16, 2002), for the emissions guidelines as promulgated on September 15, 1997, and on or before the date 3 years after EPA approval of an amended state plan (but not later than October 6, 2014), for the emissions guidelines as amended on October 6, 2009.
