###### § 434.82 Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, the following effluent limitations apply to mine drainage from applicable areas of western coal mining operations:

(a) The operator must submit a site-specific Sediment Control Plan to the permitting authority that is designed to prevent an increase in the average annual sediment yield from pre-mined, undisturbed conditions. The Sediment Control Plan must be approved by the permitting authority and be incorporated into the permit as an effluent limitation. The Sediment Control Plan must identify best management practices (BMPs) and also must describe design specifications, construction specifications, maintenance schedules, criteria for inspection, as well as expected performance and longevity of the best management practices.

(b) Using watershed models, the operator must demonstrate that implementation of the Sediment Control Plan will result in average annual sediment yields that will not be greater than the sediment yield levels from pre-mined, undisturbed conditions. The operator must use the same watershed model that was, or will be, used to acquire the SMCRA permit.

(c) The operator must design, implement, and maintain BMPs in the manner specified in the Sediment Control Plan.
