###### § 205.172 Maintenance of records; submittal of information.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in regulation, the manufacturer of any new exhaust system subject to any of the standards or procedures prescribed in this subpart must establish, maintain and retain the following adequately organized and indexed records:

(1) General records:

(i) Identification and description by category parameters of all exhaust systems in the manufacturer's product line;

(ii) A description of any procedures other than those contained in this subpart used to perform noise emission tests on any test exhaust system;

(iii) A record of the calibration of the acoustical instrumentation as is described in appendix I;

(iv) A record of the date of manufacture of each exhaust system subject to this subpart, keyed to the serial number.

(2) Individual records for test exhaust systems:

(i) A complete record of all noise emission tests performed for Production Verification and Selective Enforcement Audit (except tests performed by EPA directly), including all individual worksheets and other documentation or exact copies relating to each test;

(ii) A record of the information recorded as described in Appendix I; and

(iii) A record and description of all repairs, maintenance and other servicing which were performed before successful testing of the exhaust system pursuant to these regulations and which could affect the noise emission of the exhaust system, giving the date and time of the maintenance or service, the reason for it, the person authorizing it, and the names of supervisory personnel responsible for the conduct of the maintenance or service.

(3) A properly filed production verification report following the format prescribed by the Administrator in § 205.168-3 fulfills the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(4) All records required to be maintained under this subpart must be retained by the manufacturer for a period of three (3) years from the production verification date. Records may be retained as hard copy or alternatively reduced to microfilm, punch cards, etc., depending on the record retention procedures of the manufacturer; however, when an alternative method is used, all information contained in the hard copy must be contained in the copy made by the alternative method.

(b) The manufacturer must, upon request, submit to the Administrator the following information with regard to new exhaust system production:

(1) Number of exhaust systems, by category, scheduled for production for the time period designated in the request.

(2) Number of exhaust systems, by category, produced during the time period designated in the request.

(c) The reporting requirements of this regulation will no longer be effective after five (5) years from the last effective date of this regulation. However, the requirements will remain in effect if the Administrator is taking appropriate steps to repromulgate or modify the reporting requirements at that time.
