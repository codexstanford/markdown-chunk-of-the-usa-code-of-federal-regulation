###### § 63.693 Standards: Closed-vent systems and control devices.
####### e.g.,

(i) Following the initial startup of the control device, all carbon in the control device shall be replaced with fresh carbon on a regular, predetermined time interval that is no longer than the carbon service life established for the carbon adsorption system. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(4)(i) do not apply to a nonregenerable carbon adsorption system (a carbon canister) for which the carbon canister or the carbon in the control device is replaced on a regular basis according to the requirements in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section.

(ii) The spent carbon removed from the carbon adsorption system must be either regenerated, reactivated, or burned in one of the units specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(A) through (d)(4)(ii)(G) of this section.

(A) Regenerated or reactivated in a thermal treatment unit for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 that implements the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart X.

(B) Regenerated or reactivated in a thermal treatment unit equipped with and operating air emission controls in accordance with this section.

(C) Regenerated or reactivated in a thermal treatment unit equipped with and operating organic air emission controls in accordance with a national emission standard for hazardous air pollutants under another subpart in 40 CFR part 63 or 40 CFR part 61.

(D) Burned in a hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator has been issued a final permit under 40 CFR part 270 that implements the requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O.

(E) Burned in a hazardous waste incinerator for which the owner or operator has designed and operates the incinerator in accordance with the interim status requirements of 40 CFR part 265, subpart O.

(iii) As an alternative to meeting the requirements in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4)(i) of this section, an owner or operator of a nonregenerable carbon adsorption system may choose to replace on a regular basis the carbon canister or the carbon in the control device using the procedures in either paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) or (d)(4)(iii)(B) of this section. For the purpose of complying with this paragraph (d)(4)(iii), a nonregenerable carbon adsorption system means a carbon adsorption system that does not regenerate the carbon bed directly onsite in the control device, such as a carbon canister. The spent carbon removed from the nonregenerable carbon adsorption system must be managed according to the requirements in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section.
