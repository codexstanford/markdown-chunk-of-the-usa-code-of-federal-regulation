###### § 61.174 Test methods and procedures.

(a) To determine compliance with § 61.172(c), the owner or operator shall conduct emission tests and reduce the test data in accordance with the test methods and procedures contained in this section unless the Administrator:

(1) Specifies or approves, in specific cases, the use of a reference method with minor changes in methodology,

(2) Approves the use of an equivalent method,

(3) Approves the use of an alternative method, the results of which he has determined to be adequate for indicating whether a specific source is in compliance, or

(4) Waives the requirement for emission tests as provided in § 61.13.

(b) The owner or operator shall conduct the emission tests required in paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) After achieving the optimum operating conditions submitted under § 60.172(b)(2)(ii)(B) for the equipment required in § 61.172(b)(1), but no later than 90 days after the effective date of this subpart in the case of an existing copper converter or a copper converter that has an initial startup date preceding the effective date, or

(2) After achieving the optimum operating conditions submitted under § 60.172(b)(2)(ii)(B) for the equipment required in § 61.172(b)(1), but no later than 90 days after startup in the case of a new copper converter, initial startup of which occurs after the effective date, or

(3) At such other times as may be required by the Administrator under section 114 of the Act.

(c) The owner or operator shall conduct each emission test under representative operating conditions and at sample locations subject to the Administrator's approval, and shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of the emission test.

(d) For the purpose of determining compliance with § 61.172(c), the owner or operator shall use reference methods in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as follows:

(1) Method 5 for the measurement of particulate matter,

(2) Method 1 for sample and velocity traverses,

(3) Method 2 for velocity and volumetric flow rate,

(4) Method 3 for gas analysis, and

(5) Method 4 for stack gas moisture.

(e) For Method 5, the sampling time for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and the minimum sampling volume shall be 0.85 dscm (30 dscf) except that smaller times or volumes when necessitated by process variables or other factors may be approved by the Administrator.

(f) For the purpose of determining applicability under § 61.172(a), the owner or operator shall determine the converter arsenic charging rate as follows:

(1) Collect daily grab samples of copper matte and any lead matte charged to the copper converters.

(2) Each calendar month, from the daily grab samples collected under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, put together a composite copper matte sample and a composite lead matte sample. Analyze the composite samples individually using Method 108A, 108B, or 108C to determine the weight percent of inorganic arsenic contained in each sample.

(3) Calculate the converter arsenic charging rate once per month using the following equation:

(4) Determine an annual arsenic charging rate for the copper converter department once per month by computing the arithmetic average of the 12 monthly converter arsenic charging rate values (R) for the preceding 12-month period.

(g) An owner or operator may petition the Administrator for a modified sampling and analysis schedule if analyses performed for the first 12-month period after the effective date show the source to be considerably below the applicability limit prescribed in § 61.172(a).
