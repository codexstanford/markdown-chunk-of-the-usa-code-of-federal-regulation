(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best practicable control technology currently available: There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants to navigable waters.

(b) Process waste water pollutants from a cooling water recirculation system designed, constructed and operated to maintain a surge capacity equal to the runoff from the 10-year, 24-hour rainfall event may be discharged, after treatment to the standards set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, whenever chronic or catastrophic precipitation events cause the water level in the pond to rise into the surge capacity. Process waste water must be treated and discharged whenever the water level equals or exceeds the mid point of the surge capacity.

(c) The concentration of pollutants discharged in process wastewater pursuant to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section shall not exceed the values listed in the following table:

(d) The concentration of pollutants discharged in contaminated non-process wastewater shall not exceed the values listed in the following table:
