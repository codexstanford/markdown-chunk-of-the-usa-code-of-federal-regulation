(1) 0.45 lb/mmBtu of heat input on an annual average basis for tangentially fired boilers.

(2) 0.50 lb/mmBtu of heat input on an annual average basis for dry bottom wall-fired boilers (other than units applying cell burner technology).

(b) The owner or operator shall determine the annual average NOemission rate, in lb/mmBtu, using the methods and procedures specified in part 75 of this chapter.

(c) Unless the unit meets the early election requirement of § 76.8, the owner or operator of a coal-fired substitution unit with a tangentially fired boiler or a dry bottom wall-fired boiler (other than units applying cell burner technology) that satisfies the requirements of § 76.1(c)(2), shall comply with the NOemission limitations that apply to Group 1, Phase II boilers.

(d) The owner or operator of a Phase I unit with a cell burner boiler that converts to a conventional wall-fired boiler on or before January 1, 1995 or, for a unit subject to section 404(d) of the Act, the date the unit is required to meet Acid Rain emissions reduction requirements for SOshall comply, by such respective date or January 1, 1996, whichever is later, with the NOemissions limitation applicable to dry bottom wall-fired boilers under paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (c) or (e) of this section or in § 76.10, 76.11, or 76.12.

(e) The owner or operator of a Phase I unit with a Group 1 boiler that converts to a fluidized bed or other type of utility boiler not included in Group 1 boilers on or before January 1, 1995 or, for a unit subject to section 404(d) of the Act, the date the unit is required to meet Acid Rain emissions reduction requirements for SOis exempt from the NOemissions limitations specified in paragraph (a) of this section, but shall comply with the NOemission limitations for Group 2 boilers under § 76.6.
