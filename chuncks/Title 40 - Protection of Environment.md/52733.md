###### § 98.250 Definition of source category.

(a) A petroleum refinery is any facility engaged in producing gasoline, gasoline blending stocks, naphtha, kerosene, distillate fuel oils, residual fuel oils, lubricants, or asphalt (bitumen) through distillation of petroleum or through redistillation, cracking, or reforming of unfinished petroleum derivatives, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) For the purposes of this subpart, facilities that distill only pipeline transmix (off-spec material created when different specification products mix during pipeline transportation) are not petroleum refineries, regardless of the products produced.

(c) This source category consists of the following sources at petroleum refineries: Catalytic cracking units; fluid coking units; delayed coking units; catalytic reforming units; coke calcining units; asphalt blowing operations; blowdown systems; storage tanks; process equipment components (compressors, pumps, valves, pressure relief devices, flanges, and connectors) in gas service; marine vessel, barge, tanker truck, and similar loading operations; flares; sulfur recovery plants; and non-merchant hydrogen plants (i.e., hydrogen plants that are owned or under the direct control of the refinery owner and operator).
