(A) Spill prevention equipment-visually check for damage; remove liquid or debris; check for and remove obstructions in the fill pipe; check the fill cap to make sure it is securely on the fill pipe; and, for double walled spill prevention equipment with interstitial monitoring, check for a leak in the interstitial area; and

(B) Release detection equipment-check to make sure the release detection equipment is operating with no alarms or other unusual operating conditions present; and ensure records of release detection testing are reviewed and current; and

(ii) Annually:

(A) Containment sumps-visually check for damage, leaks to the containment area, or releases to the environment; remove liquid (in contained sumps) or debris; and, for double walled sumps with interstitial monitoring, check for a leak in the interstitial area; and

(B) Hand held release detection equipment-check devices such as tank gauge sticks or groundwater bailers for operability and serviceability;

(2) Conduct operation and maintenance walkthrough inspections according to a standard code of practice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory that checks equipment comparable to paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

(3) Conduct operation and maintenance walkthrough inspections developed by the implementing agency that checks equipment comparable to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(b) Owners and operators must maintain records (in accordance with § 280.34) of operation and maintenance walkthrough inspections for one year.
