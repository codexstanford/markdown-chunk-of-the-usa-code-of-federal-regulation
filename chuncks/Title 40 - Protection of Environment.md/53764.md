(q)All TWTDS subject to paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section must provide the information in this paragraph to the Director, using Form 2S or another application form approved by the Director. New applicants must submit all information available at the time of permit application. The information may be provided by referencing information previously submitted to the Director. The Director may waive any requirement of this paragraph if he or she has access to substantially identical information. The Director may also waive any requirement of this paragraph that is not of material concern for a specific permit, if approved by the Regional Administrator. The waiver request to the Regional Administrator must include the State's justification for the waiver. A Regional Administrator's disapproval of a State's proposed waiver does not constitute final Agency action, but does provide notice to the State and permit applicant(s) that EPA may object to any State-issued permit issued in the absence of the required information.
