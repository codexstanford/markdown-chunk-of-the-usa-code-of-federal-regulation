###### § 267.18 What are the standards for selecting the location of my facility?

(a) You may not locate portions of new facilities where hazardous waste will be treated or stored within 61 meters (200 feet) of a fault that has had displacement in Holocene time.

(1) "Fault" means a fracture along which rocks on one side have been displaced with respect to those on the other side.

(2) "Displacement" means the relative movement of any two sides of a fault measured in any direction.

(3) "Holocene" means the most recent epoch of the Quaternary period, extending from the end of the Pleistocene to the present.

(b) If your facility is located in a 100-year flood plain, it must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to prevent washout of any hazardous waste by a 100-year flood.

(1) "100-year flood plain" means any land area that is subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year from any source.

(2) "Washout" means the movement of hazardous waste from the active portion of the facility as a result of flooding.

(3) "100-year flood" means a flood that has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
