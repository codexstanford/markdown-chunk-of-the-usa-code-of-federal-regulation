###### § 766.18 Method sensitivity.

The target level of quantitation required under § 766.27 for each HDD/HDF congener is the level which must be attempted for each resolved HRGC peak for that congener. For at least one product sample, at least two analyses of the same isotopically labeled HDD/HDF internal calibration standards spiked to a final product concentration equal to the LOQ for that congener must be reproducibly extracted, cleaned up, and quantified to within +/-20 percent of each other. For each spiked product sample, the signal to noise ratio for the calibration standard peaks after complete extraction and cleanup must be 10:1 or greater. The recovery of the internal calibration standards in the extracted and cleaned up product samples must be within 50 to 150 percent of the amount spiked, and the results must be corrected for recovery.
