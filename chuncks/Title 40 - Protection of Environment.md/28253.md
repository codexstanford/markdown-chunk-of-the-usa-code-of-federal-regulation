###### § 63.806 Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart shall fulfill all recordkeeping requirements of § 63.10 of subpart A, according to the applicability criteria in § 63.800(d) of this subpart.

(b) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the emission limits in § 63.802 of this subpart shall maintain records of the following:

(1) A certified product data sheet for each finishing material, thinner, contact adhesive, and strippable spray booth coating subject to the emission limits in § 63.802; and

(2) The VHAP content, in kg VHAP/kg solids (lb VHAP/lb solids), as applied, of each finishing material and contact adhesive subject to the emission limits in § 63.802; and

(3) The VOC content, in kg VOC/kg solids (lb VOC/lb solids), as applied, of each strippable booth coating subject to the emission limits in § 63.802 (a)(3) or (b)(3).

(4) The formaldehyde content, in lb/gal, as applied, of each finishing material and contact adhesive subject to the emission limits in § 63.802(a)(4) or (b)(4) and chooses to comply with the 400 lb/yr limits on formaldehyde in § 63.802(a)(4) (i) or (b)(4)(i).

(c) The owner or operator of an affected source following the compliance method in § 63.804 (a)(1) or (d)(1) shall maintain copies of the averaging calculation for each month following the compliance date, as well as the data on the quantity of coatings and thinners used that is necessary to support the calculation of E in Equation 1.

(d) The owner or operator of an affected source following the compliance procedures of § 63.804 (f)(3)(ii) and (g)(3)(ii) shall maintain the records required by § 63.806(b) as well as records of the following:

(1) Solvent and coating additions to the continuous coater reservoir;

(2) Viscosity measurements; and

(3) Data demonstrating that viscosity is an appropriate parameter for demonstrating compliance.

(e) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the work practice standards in § 63.803 of this subpart shall maintain onsite the work practice implementation plan and all records associated with fulfilling the requirements of that plan, including, but not limited to:

(1) Records demonstrating that the operator training program required by § 63.803(b) is in place;

(2) Records collected in accordance with the inspection and maintenance plan required by § 63.803(c);

(3) Records associated with the cleaning solvent accounting system required by § 63.803(d);

(4) [Reserved]

(5) Records associated with the formulation assessment plan required by § 63.803(l); and

(6) Copies of documentation such as logs developed to demonstrate that the other provisions of the work practice implementation plan are followed.

(f) The owner or operator of an affected source following the compliance method of § 63.804 (f)(4) or (g)(4) shall maintain copies of the calculations demonstrating that the overall control efficiency (R) of the control system results in the value of Erequired by Equations 2 or 4, records of the operating parameter values, and copies of the semiannual compliance reports required by § 63.807(d).

(g) The owner or operator of an affected source following the compliance method of § 63.804 (f)(6) or (g)(6), shall maintain copies of the calculations demonstrating that the overall control efficiency (R) of the control system results in the applicable value of Gcalculated using Equation 3, records of the operating parameter values, and copies of the semiannual compliance reports required by § 63.807(d).

(h) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the emission limits in § 63.802 and following the compliance provisions of § 63.804(f) (1), (2), (3), (5), (7) and (8) and § 63.804(g) (1), (2), (3), (5), (7), and (8) shall maintain records of the compliance certifications submitted in accordance with § 63.807(c) for each semiannual period following the compliance date.

(i) The owner or operator of an affected source shall maintain records of all other information submitted with the compliance status report required by § 63.9(h) and § 63.807(b) and the semiannual reports required by § 63.807(c).
