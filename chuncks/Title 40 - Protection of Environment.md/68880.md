##### Subpart A - Program Scope and Installation Requirements for Partially Excluded UST Systems
###### § 280.11 Installation requirements for partially excluded UST systems.

(a) Owners and operators must install an UST system listed in § 280.10(c)(1), (3), or (4) storing regulated substances (whether of single or double wall construction) that meets the following requirements:

(1) Will prevent releases due to corrosion or structural failure for the operational life of the UST system;

(2) Is cathodically protected against corrosion, constructed of non-corrodible material, steel clad with a non-corrodible material, or designed in a manner to prevent the release or threatened release of any stored substance; and

(3) Is constructed or lined with material that is compatible with the stored substance.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an UST system without corrosion protection may be installed at a site that is determined by a corrosion expert not to be corrosive enough to cause it to have a release due to corrosion during its operating life. Owners and operators must maintain records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this paragraph for the remaining life of the tank.
