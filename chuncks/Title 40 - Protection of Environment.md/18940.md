###### § 60.464 Monitoring of emissions and operations.

(a) Where compliance with the numerical limit specified in § 60.462(a) (1) or (2) is achieved through the use of low VOC-content coatings without the use of emission control devices or through the use of higher VOC-content coatings in conjunction with emission control devices, the owner or operator shall compute and record the average VOC content of coatings applied during each calendar month for each affected facility, according to the equations provided in § 60.463.

(b) Where compliance with the limit specified in § 60.462(a)(4) is achieved through the intermittent use of emission control devices, the owner or operator shall compute and record for each affected facility the average VOC content of coatings applied during each calendar month according to the equations provided in § 60.463.

(c) If thermal incineration is used, each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a device that continuously records the combustion temperature of any effluent gases incinerated to achieve compliance with § 60.462(a)(2), (3), or (4). This device shall have an accuracy of +/-2.5 &#xB0;C. or +/-0.75 percent of the temperature being measured expressed in degrees Celsius, whichever is greater. Each owner or operator shall also record all periods (during actual coating operations) in excess of 3 hours during which the average temperature in any thermal incinerator used to control emissions from an affected facility remains more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the temperature at which compliance with § 60.462(a)(2), (3), or (4) was demonstrated during the most recent measurement of incinerator efficiency required by § 60.8. The records required by § 60.7 shall identify each such occurrence and its duration. If catalytic incineration is used, the owner or operator shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a device to monitor and record continuously the gas temperature both upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed. This device shall have an accuracy of +/-2.5 &#xB0;C. or +/-0.75 percent of the temperature being measured expressed in degrees Celsius, whichever is greater. During coating operations, the owner or operator shall record all periods in excess of 3 hours where the average difference between the temperature upstream and downstream of the incinerator catalyst bed remains below 80 percent of the temperature difference at which compliance was demonstrated during the most recent measurement of incinerator efficiency or when the inlet temperature falls more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the temperature at which compliance with § 60.462(a)(2), (3), or (4) was demonstrated during the most recent measurement of incinerator efficiency required by § 60.8. The records required by § 60.7 shall identify each such occurrence and its duration.
