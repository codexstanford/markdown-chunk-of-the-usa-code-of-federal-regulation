(b) The emission limits for municipal waste combustor acid gases, expressed as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride, are specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

(1) For approval, a State plan shall include emission limits for sulfur dioxide at least as protective as the emission limits for sulfur dioxide specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(i) The emission limit for sulfur dioxide contained in the gases discharged to the atmosphere from a designated facility is 31 parts per million by volume or 25 percent of the potential sulfur dioxide emission concentration (75-percent reduction by weight or volume), corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis), whichever is less stringent. Compliance with this emission limit is based on a 24-hour daily geometric mean.

(ii) [Reserved]

(2) For approval, a State plan shall include emission limits for hydrogen chloride at least as protective as the emission limits for hydrogen chloride specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

(i) The emission limit for hydrogen chloride contained in the gases discharged to the atmosphere from a designated facility is 31 parts per million by volume or 5 percent of the potential hydrogen chloride emission concentration (95-percent reduction by weight or volume), corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis), whichever is less stringent.

(ii) [Reserved]

(3) For approval, a State plan shall be submitted by August 25, 1998 and shall include emission limits for sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride at least as protective as the emission limits specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section.

(i) The emission limit for sulfur dioxide contained in the gases discharged to the atmosphere from a designated facility is 29 parts per million by volume or 25 percent of the potential sulfur dioxide emission concentration (75-percent reduction by weight or volume), corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis), whichever is less stringent. Compliance with this emission limit is based on a 24-hour daily geometric mean.

(ii) The emission limit for hydrogen chloride contained in the gases discharged to the atmosphere from a designated facility is 29 parts per million by volume or 5 percent of the potential hydrogen chloride emission concentration (95-percent reduction by weight or volume), corrected to 7 percent oxygen (dry basis), whichever is less stringent.

(c) The emission limits for municipal waste combustor organics, expressed as total mass dioxin/furan, are specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.

(1) For approval, a State plan shall include an emission limit for dioxin/furan contained in the gases discharged to the atmosphere from a designated facility at least as protective as the emission limit for dioxin/furan specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(1)(ii), and (c)(1)(iii) of this section, as applicable.

(i) Before April 28, 2009, the emission limit for designated facilities that employ an electrostatic precipitator-based emission control system is 60 nanograms per dry standard cubic meter (total mass), corrected to 7 percent oxygen.

(d) For approval, a State plan shall include emission limits for nitrogen oxides at least as protective as the emission limits listed in table 1 of this subpart for designated facilities. table 1 provides emission limits for the nitrogen oxides concentration level for each type of designated facility.

(1) A State plan may allow nitrogen oxides emissions averaging as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(v) of this section.

(i) The owner or operator of a municipal waste combustor plant may elect to implement a nitrogen oxides emissions averaging plan for the designated facilities that are located at that plant and that are subject to subpart Cb, except as specified in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) and (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

(A) Municipal waste combustor units subject to subpart Ea or Eb cannot be included in the emissions averaging plan.

(B) Mass burn refractory municipal waste combustor units and other municipal waste combustor technologies not listed in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section may not be included in the emissions averaging plan.

(ii) The designated facilities included in the nitrogen oxides emissions averaging plan must be identified in the initial compliance report specified in § 60.59b(f) or in the annual report specified in § 60.59b(g), as applicable, prior to implementing the averaging plan. The designated facilities being included in the averaging plan may be redesignated each calendar year. Partial year redesignation is allowable with State approval.

(iii) To implement the emissions averaging plan, the average daily (24-hour) nitrogen oxides emission concentration level for gases discharged from the designated facilities being included in the emissions averaging plan must be no greater than the levels specified in table 2 of this subpart. table 2 provides emission limits for the nitrogen oxides concentration level for each type of designated facility.

(iv) Under the emissions averaging plan, the average daily nitrogen oxides emissions specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section shall be calculated using equation (1). Designated facilities that are offline shall not be included in calculating the average daily nitrogen oxides emission level.

(v) For any day in which any designated facility included in the emissions averaging plan is offline, the owner or operator of the municipal waste combustor plant must demonstrate compliance according to either paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) of this section or both paragraphs (d)(1)(v)(B) and (d)(1)(v)(C) of this section.

(A) Compliance with the applicable limits specified in table 2 of this subpart shall be demonstrated using the averaging procedure specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section for the designated facilities that are online.

(B) For each of the designated facilities included in the emissions averaging plan, the nitrogen oxides emissions on a daily average basis shall be calculated and shall be equal to or less than the maximum daily nitrogen oxides emission level achieved by that designated facility on any of the days during which the emissions averaging plan was achieved with all designated facilities online during the most recent calendar quarter. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply during the first quarter of operation under the emissions averaging plan.
