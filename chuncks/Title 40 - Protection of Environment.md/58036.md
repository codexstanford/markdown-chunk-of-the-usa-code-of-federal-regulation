###### § 148.21 Information to be submitted in support of petitions.

(a) Information submitted in support of § 148.20 must meet the following criteria:

(1) All waste analysis and any new testing performed by the petitioner shall be accurate and reproducible and performed in accordance with quality assurance standards;

(2) Estimation techniques shall be appropriate, and EPA-certified test protocols shall be used where available and appropriate;

(3) Predictive models shall have been verified and validated, shall be appropriate for the specific site, waste streams, and injection conditions of the operation, and shall be calibrated for existing sites where sufficient data are available;

(4) An approved quality assurance and quality control plan shall address all aspects of the demonstration;

(5) Reasonably conservative values shall be used whenever values taken from the literature or estimated on the basis of known information are used instead of site-specific measurements; and

(6) An analysis shall be performed to identify and assess aspects of the demonstration that contribute significantly to uncertainty. The petitioner shall conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect that significant uncertainty may contribute to the demonstration. The demonstration shall then be based on conservative assumptions identified in the analysis.

(b) Any petitioner under § 148.20(a)(1)(i) shall provide sufficient site-specific information to support the demonstration, such as:

(1) Thickness, porosity, permeability and extent of the various strata in the injection zone;

(2) Thickness, porosity, permeability, extent, and continuity of the confining zone;

(3) Hydraulic gradient in the injection zone;

(4) Hydrostatic pressure in the injection zone; and

(5) Geochemical conditions of the site.

(c) In addition to the information in § 148.21(b), any petitioner under § 148.20(a)(1)(ii) shall provide sufficient waste-specific information to ensure reasonably reliant predictions about the waste transformation. The petitioner shall provide the information necessary to support the demonstration, such as:

(1) Description of the chemical processes or other means that will lead to waste transformation; and

(2) Results of laboratory experiments verifying the waste transformation.
