###### § 1065.930 Engine starting, restarting, and shutdown.

Unless the standard-setting part specifies otherwise, start, restart, and shut down the test engine for field testing as follows:

(a) Start or restart the engine as described in the owners manual.

(b) If the engine does not start after 15 seconds of cranking, stop cranking and determine the reason it failed to start. However, you may crank the engine longer than 15 seconds, as long as the owners manual or the service-repair manual describes the longer cranking time as normal.

(c) Respond to engine stalling with the following steps:

(1) If the engine stalls during a required warm-up before emission sampling begins, restart the engine and continue warm-up.

(2) If the engine stalls at any other time after emission sampling begins, restart the engine and continue testing.

(d) Shut down and restart the engine according to the manufacturer's specifications, as needed during normal operation in-use, but continue emission sampling until the field test is complete.
