(13) The applicant has filed applications for or obtained any required regulatory approvals for the project and is in compliance, or promptly will be in compliance, where appropriate, with all Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements;

(14) The applicant has no delinquent federal debt, including tax liabilities, unless the delinquency has been resolved with the appropriate federal agency in accordance with the standards of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996;

(15) The credit agreement and related agreements contain such other terms and conditions as EPA deems reasonable and necessary to protect the interests of the United States, including without limitation provisions for (i) such collateral and other credit support for the credit agreement, and (ii) such collateral sharing, priorities and voting rights among creditors and other intercreditor arrangements as, in each case, EPA deems reasonable and necessary to protect the interests of the United States; and

(2) EPA and the Inspector General, or their duly authorized representatives, must have access, for the purpose of audit and examination, to any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the applicant. Examination of records may be made during the regular business hours of the applicant, or at any other time mutually convenient.
