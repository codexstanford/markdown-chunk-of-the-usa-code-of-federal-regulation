###### § 146.95 Class VI injection depth waiver requirements.

This section sets forth information which an owner or operator seeking a waiver of the Class VI injection depth requirements must submit to the Director; information the Director must consider in consultation with all affected Public Water System Supervision Directors; the procedure for Director-Regional Administrator communication and waiver issuance; and the additional requirements that apply to owners or operators of Class VI wells granted a waiver of the injection depth requirements.

(a) In seeking a waiver of the requirement to inject below the lowermost USDW, the owner or operator must submit a supplemental report concurrent with permit application. The supplemental report must include the following,

(1) A demonstration that the injection zone(s) is/are laterally continuous, is not a USDW, and is not hydraulically connected to USDWs; does not outcrop; has adequate injectivity, volume, and sufficient porosity to safely contain the injected carbon dioxide and formation fluids; and has appropriate geochemistry.

(2) A demonstration that the injection zone(s) is/are bounded by laterally continuous, impermeable confining units above and below the injection zone(s) adequate to prevent fluid movement and pressure buildup outside of the injection zone(s); and that the confining unit(s) is/are free of transmissive faults and fractures. The report shall further characterize the regional fracture properties and contain a demonstration that such fractures will not interfere with injection, serve as conduits, or endanger USDWs.

(3) A demonstration, using computational modeling, that USDWs above and below the injection zone will not be endangered as a result of fluid movement. This modeling should be conducted in conjunction with the area of review determination, as described in § 146.84, and is subject to requirements, as described in § 146.84(c), and periodic reevaluation, as described in § 146.84(e).

(4) A demonstration that well design and construction, in conjunction with the waiver, will ensure isolation of the injectate in lieu of requirements at 146.86(a)(1) and will meet well construction requirements in paragraph (f) of this section.

(5) A description of how the monitoring and testing and any additional plans will be tailored to the geologic sequestration project to ensure protection of USDWs above and below the injection zone(s), if a waiver is granted.

(6) Information on the location of all the public water supplies affected, reasonably likely to be affected, or served by USDWs in the area of review.

(7) Any other information requested by the Director to inform the Regional Administrator's decision to issue a waiver.

(b) To inform the Regional Administrator's decision on whether to grant a waiver of the injection depth requirements at §§ 144.6 of this chapter, 146.5(f), and 146.86(a)(1), the Director must submit, to the Regional Administrator, documentation of the following:

(1) An evaluation of the following information as it relates to siting, construction, and operation of a geologic sequestration project with a waiver:

(i) The integrity of the upper and lower confining units;

(ii) The suitability of the injection zone(s) (e.g., lateral continuity; lack of transmissive faults and fractures; knowledge of current or planned artificial penetrations into the injection zone(s) or formations below the injection zone);

(iii) The potential capacity of the geologic formation(s) to sequester carbon dioxide, accounting for the availability of alternative injection sites;

(iv) All other site characterization data, the proposed emergency and remedial response plan, and a demonstration of financial responsibility;

(v) Community needs, demands, and supply from drinking water resources;

(vi) Planned needs, potential and/or future use of USDWs and non-USDWs in the area;

(vii) Planned or permitted water, hydrocarbon, or mineral resource exploitation potential of the proposed injection formation(s) and other formations both above and below the injection zone to determine if there are any plans to drill through the formation to access resources in or beneath the proposed injection zone(s)/formation(s);

(viii) The proposed plan for securing alternative resources or treating USDW formation waters in the event of contamination related to the Class VI injection activity; and,

(ix) Any other applicable considerations or information requested by the Director.

(2) Consultation with the Public Water System Supervision Directors of all States and Tribes having jurisdiction over lands within the area of review of a well for which a waiver is sought.

(3) Any written waiver-related information submitted by the Public Water System Supervision Director(s) to the (UIC) Director.

(c) Pursuant to requirements at § 124.10 of this chapter and concurrent with the Class VI permit application notice process, the Director shall give public notice that a waiver application has been submitted. The notice shall clearly state:

(1) The depth of the proposed injection zone(s);

(2) The location of the injection well(s);

(3) The name and depth of all USDWs within the area of review;

(4) A map of the area of review;

(5) The names of any public water supplies affected, reasonably likely to be affected, or served by USDWs in the area of review; and,

(6) The results of UIC-Public Water System Supervision consultation required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(d) Following public notice, the Director shall provide all information received through the waiver application process to the Regional Administrator. Based on the information provided, the Regional Administrator shall provide written concurrence or non-concurrence regarding waiver issuance.

(1) If the Regional Administrator determines that additional information is required to support a decision, the Director shall provide the information. At his or her discretion, the Regional Administrator may require that public notice of the new information be initiated.

(2) In no case shall a Director of a State-approved program issue a waiver without receipt of written concurrence from the Regional Administrator.

(e) If a waiver is issued, within 30 days of waiver issuance, EPA shall post the following information on the Office of Water's Web site:

(1) The depth of the proposed injection zone(s);

(2) The location of the injection well(s);

(3) The name and depth of all USDWs within the area of review;

(4) A map of the area of review;

(5) The names of any public water supplies affected, reasonably likely to be affected, or served by USDWs in the area of review; and

(6) The date of waiver issuance.

(f) Upon receipt of a waiver of the requirement to inject below the lowermost USDW for geologic sequestration, the owner or operator of the Class VI well must comply with:

(1) All requirements at §§ 146.84, 146.85, 146.87, 146.88, 146.89, 146.91, 146.92, and 146.94;

(2) All requirements at § 146.86 with the following modified requirements:

(i) The owner or operator must ensure that Class VI wells with a waiver are constructed and completed to prevent movement of fluids into any unauthorized zones including USDWs, in lieu of requirements at § 146.86(a)(1).

(ii) The casing and cementing program must be designed to prevent the movement of fluids into any unauthorized zones including USDWs in lieu of requirements at § 146.86(b)(1).

(iii) The surface casing must extend through the base of the nearest USDW directly above the injection zone and be cemented to the surface; or, at the Director's discretion, another formation above the injection zone and below the nearest USDW above the injection zone.

(3) All requirements at § 146.90 with the following modified requirements:

(i) The owner or operator shall monitor the groundwater quality, geochemical changes, and pressure in the first USDWs immediately above and below the injection zone(s); and in any other formations at the discretion of the Director.

(ii) Testing and monitoring to track the extent of the carbon dioxide plume and the presence or absence of elevated pressure (e.g., the pressure front) by using direct methods to monitor for pressure changes in the injection zone(s); and, indirect methods (e.g., seismic, electrical, gravity, or electromagnetic surveys and/or down-hole carbon dioxide detection tools), unless the Director determines, based on site-specific geology, that such methods are not appropriate.

(4) All requirements at § 146.93 with the following, modified post-injection site care monitoring requirements:

(i) The owner or operator shall monitor the groundwater quality, geochemical changes and pressure in the first USDWs immediately above and below the injection zone; and in any other formations at the discretion of the Director.

(ii) Testing and monitoring to track the extent of the carbon dioxide plume and the presence or absence of elevated pressure (e.g., the pressure front) by using direct methods in the injection zone(s); and indirect methods (e.g., seismic, electrical, gravity, or electromagnetic surveys and/or down-hole carbon dioxide detection tools), unless the Director determines based on site-specific geology, that such methods are not appropriate;

(5) Any additional requirements requested by the Director designed to ensure protection of USDWs above and below the injection zone(s).
