###### Emission Standards for Owners and Operators
####### § 60.4204 What emission standards must I meet for non-emergency engines if I am an owner or operator of a stationary CI internal combustion engine?

(a) Owners and operators of pre-2007 model year non-emergency stationary CI ICE with a displacement of less than 10 liters per cylinder must comply with the emission standards in table 1 to this subpart. Owners and operators of pre-2007 model year non-emergency stationary CI ICE with a displacement of greater than or equal to 10 liters per cylinder and less than 30 liters per cylinder must comply with the Tier 1 emission standards in 40 CFR part 1042, appendix I.

(b) Owners and operators of 2007 model year and later non-emergency stationary CI ICE with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder must comply with the emission standards for new CI engines in § 60.4201 for their 2007 model year and later stationary CI ICE, as applicable.

(c) Owners and operators of non-emergency stationary CI engines with a displacement of greater than or equal to 30 liters per cylinder must meet the following requirements:

(1) For engines installed prior to January 1, 2012, limit the emissions of NOin the stationary CI internal combustion engine exhaust to the following:

(i) 17.0 grams per kilowatt-hour (g/KW-hr) (12.7 grams per horsepower-hr (g/HP-hr)) when maximum engine speed is less than 130 revolutions per minute (rpm);

(ii) 45 &#xB7; ng/KW-hr (34 &#xB7; ng/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is 130 or more but less than 2,000 rpm, where n is maximum engine speed; and

(iii) 9.8 g/KW-hr (7.3 g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is 2,000 rpm or more.

(2) For engines installed on or after January 1, 2012 and before January 1, 2016, limit the emissions of NOin the stationary CI internal combustion engine exhaust to the following:

(i) 14.4 g/KW-hr (10.7 g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is less than 130 rpm;

(ii) 44 &#xB7; ng/KW-hr (33 &#xB7; ng/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is greater than or equal to 130 but less than 2,000 rpm and where n is maximum engine speed; and

(iii) 7.7 g/KW-hr (5.7 g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is greater than or equal to 2,000 rpm.

(3) For engines installed on or after January 1, 2016, limit the emissions of NOin the stationary CI internal combustion engine exhaust to the following:

(i) 3.4 g/KW-hr (2.5 g/HP-hr) when maximum engine speed is less than 130 rpm;

(ii) 9.0 &#xB7; ng/KW-hr (6.7 &#xB7; ng/HP-hr) where n (maximum engine speed) is 130 or more but less than 2,000 rpm; and

(iii) 2.0 g/KW-hr (1.5 g/HP-hr) where maximum engine speed is greater than or equal to 2,000 rpm.

(4) Reduce particulate matter (PM) emissions by 60 percent or more, or limit the emissions of PM in the stationary CI internal combustion engine exhaust to 0.15 g/KW-hr (0.11 g/HP-hr).

(d) Owners and operators of non-emergency stationary CI ICE with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder who conduct performance tests in-use must meet the not-to-exceed (NTE) standards as indicated in § 60.4212.

(e) Owners and operators of any modified or reconstructed non-emergency stationary CI ICE subject to this subpart must meet the emission standards applicable to the model year, maximum engine power, and displacement of the modified or reconstructed non-emergency stationary CI ICE that are specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.

(f) Owners and operators of stationary CI ICE certified to the standards in 40 CFR part 1039 and equipped with AECDs as specified in 40 CFR 1039.665 must meet the Tier 1 certification emission standards for new nonroad CI engines in 40 CFR part 1039, appendix I, while the AECD is activated during a qualified emergency situation. A qualified emergency situation is defined in 40 CFR 1039.665. When the qualified emergency situation has ended and the AECD is deactivated, the engine must resume meeting the otherwise applicable emission standard specified in this section.
