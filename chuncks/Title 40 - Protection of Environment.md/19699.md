###### § 60.734 Monitoring of emissions and operations.

(a) With the exception of the process units described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of this subpart who uses a dry control device to comply with the mass emission standard shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous monitoring system to measure and record the opacity of emissions discharged into the atmosphere from the control device.

(b) In lieu of a continuous opacity monitoring system, the owner or operator of a ball clay vibrating grate dryer, a bentonite rotary dryer, a diatomite flash dryer, a diatomite rotary calciner, a feldspar rotary dryer, a fire clay rotary dryer, an industrial sand fluid bed dryer, a kaolin rotary calciner, a perlite rotary dryer, a roofing granules fluid bed dryer, a roofing granules rotary dryer, a talc rotary calciner, a titanium dioxide spray dryer, a titanium dioxide fluid bed dryer, a vermiculite fluid bed dryer, or a vermiculite rotary dryer who uses a dry control device may have a certified visible emissions observer measure and record three 6-minute averages of the opacity of visible emissions to the atmosphere each day of operation in accordance with Method 9 of appendix A of part 60.

(c) The owner or operator of a ball clay rotary dryer, a diatomite rotary dryer, a feldspar fluid bed dryer, a fuller's earth rotary dryer, a gypsum rotary dryer, a gypsum flash calciner, gypsum kettle calciner, an industrial sand rotary dryer, a kaolin rotary dryer, a kaolin multiple hearth furnace, a perlite expansion furnace, a talc flash dryer, a talc rotary dryer, a titanium dioxide direct or indirect rotary dryer or a vermiculite expansion furnace who uses a dry control device is exempt from the monitoring requirements of this section.

(d) The owner or operator of an affected facility subject to the provisions of this subpart who uses a wet scrubber to comply with the mass emission standard for any affected facility shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices that continuously measure and record the pressure loss of the gas stream through the scrubber and the scrubbing liquid flow rate to the scrubber. The pressure loss monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within 5 percent of water column gauge pressure at the level of operation. The liquid flow rate monitoring device must be certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within 5 percent of design scrubbing liquid flow rate.
