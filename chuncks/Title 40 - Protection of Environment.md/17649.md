#### PART 60 - STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR NEW STATIONARY SOURCES
##### Subpart Da - Standards of Performance for Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
###### § 60.42Da Standards for particulate matter (PM).

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, an owner or operator of an affected facility shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any affected facility for which construction, reconstruction, or modification commenced before March 1, 2005, any gases that contain PM in excess of 13 ng/J (0.03 lb/MMBtu) heat input.

(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, on and after the date the initial PM performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, an owner or operator of an affected facility shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases which exhibit greater than 20 percent opacity (6-minute average), except for one 6-minute period per hour of not more than 27 percent opacity.

(1) An owner or operator of an affected facility that elects to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for measuring PM emissions according to the requirements of this subpart is exempt from the opacity standard specified in this paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) An owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts only natural gas and/or synthetic natural gas that chemically meets the definition of natural gas is exempt from the opacity standard specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

(c) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005, but before May 4, 2011, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of either:

(1) 18 ng/J (0.14 lb/MWh) gross energy output; or

(2) 6.4 ng/J (0.015 lb/MMBtu) heat input derived from the combustion of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel.

(d) As an alternative to meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility for which construction, reconstruction, or modification commenced after February 28, 2005, but before May 4, 2011, may elect to meet the requirements of this paragraph. On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of:

(1) 13 ng/J (0.030 lb/MMBtu) heat input derived from the combustion of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, and

(2) For an affected facility that commenced construction or reconstruction, 0.1 percent of the combustion concentration determined according to the procedure in § 60.48Da(o)(5) (99.9 percent reduction) when combusting solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel, or

(3) For an affected facility that commenced modification, 0.2 percent of the combustion concentration determined according to the procedure in § 60.48Da(o)(5) (99.8 percent reduction) when combusting solid, liquid, or gaseous fuel.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification commenced after May 3, 2011, shall meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of the applicable emissions limit specified in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(i) For an affected facility which commenced construction or reconstruction:

(A) 11 ng/J (0.090 lb/MWh) gross energy output; or

(B) 12 ng/J (0.097 lb/MWh) net energy output.

(ii) For an affected facility which commenced modification, the emission limits specified in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section.

(2) During startup periods and shutdown periods, owners or operators of facilities subject to subpart UUUUU of part 63 of this chapter shall meet the work practice standards specified in Table 3 to subpart UUUUU of part 63 and use the relevant definitions in § 63.10042, and owners or operators of facilities subject to subpart DDDDD of part 63 shall meet the work practice standards specified in Table 3 to subpart DDDDD of part 63 and use the relevant definition used in § 63.7575.

(f) An owner or operator of an affected facility that meets the conditions in either paragraphs (f)(1) or (2) of this section is exempt from the PM emissions limits in this section.

(1) The affected facility combusts only gaseous or liquid fuels (excluding residual oil) with potential SOemissions rates of 26 ng/J (0.060 lb/MMBtu) or less, and that does not use a post-combustion technology to reduce emissions of SOor PM.

(2) The affected facility is operated under a PM commercial demonstration permit issued by the Administrator according to the provisions of § 60.47Da.
