###### § 60.703 Monitoring of emissions and operations.

(a) The owner or operator of an affected facility that uses an incinerator to seek to comply with the TOC emission limit specified under § 60.702(a) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:

(1) A temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of +/-1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or +/-0.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater.

(i) Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox in a position before any substantial heat exchange is encountered.

(ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.

(2) A flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow diverted from being routed to the incinerator at least once every 15 minutes for each affected facility, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

(i) The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the vent stream from being routed to the incinerator, resulting in its emission to the atmosphere.

(ii) Where the bypass line valve is secured in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration, a flow indicator is not required. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.

(b) The owner or operator of an affected facility that uses a flare to seek to comply with § 60.702(b) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:

(1) A heat sensing device, such as an ultraviolet beam sensor or thermocouple, at the pilot light to indicate the continuous presence of a flame.

(2) A flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow diverted from being routed to the flare at least once every 15 minutes for each affected facility, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

(i) The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the vent stream from being routed to the flare, resulting in its emission to the atmosphere.

(ii) Where the bypass line valve is secured in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration, a flow indicator is not required. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.

(c) The owner or operator of an affected facility that uses a boiler or process heater to seek to comply with § 60.702(a) shall install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:

(1) A flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow diverted from being routed to the boiler or process heater at least once every 15 minutes for each affected facility, except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

(i) The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the vent stream from being routed to the boiler or process heater, resulting in its emission to the atmosphere.

(ii) Where the bypass line valve is secured in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration, a flow indicator is not required. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and the vent stream is not diverted through the bypass line.

(2) A temperature monitoring device in the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of +/-1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or +/-0.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater, for boilers or process heaters of less than 44 MW (150 million Btu/hr) design heat input capacity. Any vent stream introduced with primary fuel into a boiler or process heater is exempt from this requirement.

(d) The owner or operator of an affected facility that seeks to demonstrate compliance with the TRE index value limit specified under § 60.702(c) shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to manufacturer's specifications the following equipment, unless alternative monitoring procedures or requirements are approved for that facility by the Administrator:

(1) Where an absorber is the final recovery device in the recovery system:

(i) A scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device having an accuracy of +/-1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or +/-0.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater, and a specific gravity monitoring device having an accuracy of +/-0.02 specific gravity units, each equipped with a continuous recorder; or

(ii) An organic monitoring device used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds exiting the recovery device based on a detection principle such as infra-red, photoionization, or thermal conductivity, each equipped with a continuous recorder.

(2) Where a condenser is the final recovery device in the recovery system:

(i) A condenser exit (product side) temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of +/-1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or +/-0.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater; or

(ii) An organic monitoring device used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds exiting the recovery device based on a detection principle such as infra-red, photoionization, or thermal conductivity, each equipped with a continuous recorder.

(3) Where a carbon adsorber is the final recovery device unit in the recovery system:

(i) An integrating steam flow monitoring device having an accuracy of +/-10 percent, and a carbon bed temperature monitoring device having an accuracy of +/-1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or +/-0.5 &#xB0;C, whichever is greater, both equipped with a continuous recorder; or

(ii) An organic monitoring device used to indicate the concentration level of organic compounds exiting the recovery device based on a detection principle such as infra-red, photoionization, or thermal conductivity, each equipped with a continuous recorder.

(e) An owner or operator of an affected facility seeking to demonstrate compliance with the standards specified under § 60.702 with a control device other than an incinerator, boiler, process heater, or flare; or a recovery device other than an absorber, condenser, or carbon adsorber, shall provide to the Administrator information describing the operation of the control device or recovery device and the process parameter(s) which would indicate proper operation and maintenance of the device. The Administrator may request further information and will specify appropriate monitoring procedures or requirements.
