####### Operating an UST or UST system after foreclosure.

(b)The following provisions apply to a holder who, through foreclosure, as defined in § 280.210(c), acquires a petroleum UST or UST system or facility or property on which a petroleum UST or UST system is located.

(1) A holder is not an "operator" of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with this part if there is an operator, other than the holder, who is in control of or has responsibility for the daily operation of the UST or UST system, and who can be held responsible for compliance with applicable requirements of this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281.

(2) If another operator does not exist, as provided for under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a holder is not an "operator" of the UST or UST system, for purposes of compliance with the UST technical standards as defined in § 280.200(a), the UST corrective action requirements under §§ 280.51 through 280.67, and the UST financial responsibility requirements under §§ 280.90 through 280.111, provided that the holder:

(i) Empties all of its known USTs and UST systems within 60 calendar days after foreclosure or within 60 calendar days after December 6, 1995, whichever is later, or another reasonable time period specified by the implementing agency, so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue, or 0.3 percent by weight of the total capacity of the UST system, remains in the system; leaves vent lines open and functioning; and caps and secures all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment; and

(ii) Empties those USTs and UST systems that are discovered after foreclosure within 60 calendar days after discovery or within 60 calendar days after December 6, 1995, whichever is later, or another reasonable time period specified by the implementing agency, so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue, or 0.3 percent by weight of the total capacity of the UST system, remains in the system; leaves vent lines open and functioning; and caps and secures all other lines, pumps, manways, and ancillary equipment.

(3) If another operator does not exist, as provided for under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, in addition to satisfying the conditions under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the holder must either:

(i) Permanently close the UST or UST system in accordance with §§ 280.71 through 280.74, except § 280.72(b); or

(ii) Temporarily close the UST or UST system in accordance with the following applicable provisions of § 280.70:

(A) Continue operation and maintenance of corrosion protection in accordance with § 280.31;

(B) Report suspected releases to the implementing agency; and

(C) Conduct a site assessment in accordance with § 280.72(a) if the UST system is temporarily closed for more than 12 months and the UST system does not meet either the performance standards in § 280.20 for new UST systems or the upgrading requirements in § 280.21, except that the spill and overfill equipment requirements do not have to be met. The holder must report any suspected releases to the implementing agency. For purposes of this provision, the 12-month period begins to run from December 6, 1995 or from the date on which the UST system is emptied and secured under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, whichever is later.

(4) The UST system can remain in temporary closure until a subsequent purchaser has acquired marketable title to the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located. Once a subsequent purchaser acquires marketable title to the UST or UST system or facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, the purchaser must decide whether to operate or close the UST or UST system in accordance with applicable requirements in this part or applicable state requirements in those states that have been delegated authority by EPA to administer the UST program pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281.
