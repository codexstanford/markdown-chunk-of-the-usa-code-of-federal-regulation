###### § 60.565 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

(a) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep an up-to-date, readily-accessible record of the following information measured during each performance test, and shall include the following information in the report of the initial performance test in addition to the written results of such performance tests as required under § 60.8. Where a control device is used to comply with § 60.562-1(a)(1)(i)(D) only, a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information in § 60.565(a)(11) is required. Where a boiler or process heater with a design heat input capacity of 150 million Btu/hour or greater is used to comply with § 60.562-1(a), a report containing performance test data need not be submitted, but a report containing the information in § 60.565(a)(2)(i) is required. The same information specified in this section shall be submitted in the reports of all subsequently required performance tests where either the emission control efficiency of a combustion device or the outlet concentration of TOC (minus methane and ethane) is determined.

(1) When an incinerator is used to demonstrate compliance with § 60.562-1, except § 60.562-1(a)(2):

(i) The average firebox temperature of the incinerator (or the average temperature upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed), measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the performance test period, and

(ii) The percent reduction of TOC (minus methane and ethane) achieved by the incinerator, the concentration of TOC (minus methane and ethane) (ppmv, by compound) at the outlet of the control device on a dry basis, or the emission rate in terms of kg TOC (minus methane and ethane) per Mg (lb TOC/ton) of product at the outlet of the control device, whichever is appropriate. If supplemental combustion air is used, the TOC concentration corrected to 3 percent oxygen shall be recorded and reported.

(2) When a boiler or process heater is used to demonstrate compliance with § 60.562-1, except § 60.562-1(a)(2):

(i) A description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the boiler or process heater, and

(ii) For boilers or process heaters with a design heat input capacity of less than 150 million Btu/hr, all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average combustion temperature was more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the average combustion temperature during the most recent performance test at which compliance was determined.

(3) When a flare is used to demonstrate compliance with § 60.562-1, except § 60.562-1(a)(2):

(i) All visible emission readings, heat content determinations, flow rate measurements, and exit velocity determinations made during the performance test,

(ii) Continuous records of the pilot flame heat-sensing monitoring, and

(iii) Records of all periods of operations during which the pilot flame is absent.

(4) When an incinerator, boiler, or process heater is used to demonstrate compliance with § 60.562-1(a)(2), a description of the location at which the vent stream is introduced into the incinerator, boiler, or process heater.

(5) When a flare is used to demonstrate compliance with § 60.562-1(a)(2):

(7) When a condenser is the final unit in a system to demonstrate compliance with § 60.562-1, except § 60.562-1(a)(2), the average exit (product side) temperature, measured at least every 15 minutes and averaged over the performance test period while the vent stream is normally routed and constituted.

(8) Daily measurement and daily average 14-day rolling average of the ethylene glycol concentration in the liquid effluent exiting the vacuum system servicing the polymerization reaction section, if an owner or operator is subject to § 60.562-1(c) (1)(ii)(B) or (2)(ii)(B), or of the ethylene glycol concentration in the cooling water in the cooling tower, if subject to § 60.562-1(c) (2)(ii)(C) or (2)(iii)(C).

This report shall include all valves and vent pipes that could vent the stream to the atmosphere, thereby bypassing the control device, and identify which valves are car-sealed opened and which valves are car-sealed closed.

(2) If a vent system containing valves that could divert the emission stream away from the control device is used, each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep for at least two years up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of:

(i) All periods when flow is indicated if flow indicators are installed under § 69.563(d)(1).

(ii) All times when maintenance is performed on car-sealed valves, when the car seal is broken, and when the valve position is changed (i.e., from open to closed for valves in the vent piping to the control device and from closed to open for valves that vent the stream directly or indirectly to the atmosphere bypassing the control device).

(c) Where an incinerator is used to comply with § 60.562-1, except §§ 60.562(a)(1)(i)(D) and (a)(2), each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep for at least 2 years up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of:

(1) The temperature measurements specified under § 60.563(b)(1).

(2) Records of periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded. Periods of operation during which the parameter boundaries established during the most recent performance test are exceeded are defined as follows:

The owner or operator also shall record all 3-hour periods of operation during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed during the most recent performance test at which compliance was demonstrated.

(d) Where a boiler or process heater is used to comply with § 60.562-1, except §§ 60.562-1 (a)(1)(i)(D) and (a)(2), each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall keep for at least 2 years up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of:

(6) Any change in process operations that increases the uncontrolled emission rate of the process line in which the affected facility is located, as recorded in § 60.565(h).

(7) Any change in process operations that increases the uncontrolled annual emissions or the VOC weight percent of the individual stream, as recorded in § 60.565(h).

(l) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall notify the Administrator of the specific provisions of § 60.562, § 60.560(d), or § 60.560(e), as applicable, with which the owner or operator has elected to comply. Notification shall be submitted with the notification of initial startup required by § 60.7(a)(3). If an owner or operator elects at a later date to use an alternative provision of § 60.562 with which he or she will comply or becomes subject to § 60.562 for the first time (i.e., the owner or operator can no longer meet the requirements of this subpart by complying with the uncontrolled threshold emission rate cutoff provision in § 60.560 (d) or (e)), then the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator 90 days before implementing a change and, upon implementing a change, a performance test shall be performed as specified in § 60.564.

(m) The requirements of this subsection remain in force until and unless EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a State under section 111(c) of the Act, approves alternative reporting requirements or means of compliance surveillance adopted by such State. In that event, affected sources within the State will be relieved of the obligation to comply with this subsection, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the State.
