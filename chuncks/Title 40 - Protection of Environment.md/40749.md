####### Process change records.

(d)The owner or operator shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records as specified in the following and shall report this information as specified in § 65.67(b):

(1) If the process vent is Group 2B on the basis of flow rate being less than 0.011 scmm (0.40 standard cubic foot), then the owner or operator shall keep records of any process changes as defined in § 65.63(f) that increase the process vent flow rate and any recalculation or measurement of the flow rate pursuant to § 65.63(f).

(2) If the process vent is Group 2B on the basis of organic HAP or TOC concentration being less than the applicable value in table 1 to this subpart, then the owner or operator shall keep records of any process changes as defined in § 65.63(f) that increase the organic HAP or TOC concentration of the process vent and any recalculation or measurement of the concentration pursuant to § 65.63(f).

(3) If the process vent is Group 2A or Group 2B on the basis of the TRE index value being greater than 1.0, then the owner or operator shall keep records of any process changes as defined in § 65.63(f) and any recalculation of the TRE index value pursuant to § 65.63(f).

(4) As a result of a process change, if a process vent that was Group 2B on any basis becomes a Group 2B process vent only on the basis of having a TRE greater than 4.0, then the owner or operator shall keep records of the TRE index value determination performed according to the sample site and TRE index value determination procedures of § 65.64(b)(1) and (h) or determined through engineering assessment as specified in § 65.64(i).
