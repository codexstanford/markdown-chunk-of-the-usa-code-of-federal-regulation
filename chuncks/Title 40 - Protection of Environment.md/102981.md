###### § 1065.401 Test engine selection.

While all engine configurations within a certified engine family must comply with the applicable standards in the standard-setting part, you need not test each configuration for certification.

(a) Select an engine configuration within the engine family for testing, as follows:

(1) Test the engine that we specify, whether we issue general guidance or give you specific instructions.

(2) If we do not tell you which engine to test, follow any instructions in the standard-setting part.

(3) If we do not tell you which engine to test and the standard-setting part does not include specifications for selecting test engines, use good engineering judgment to select the engine configuration within the engine family that is most likely to exceed an emission standard.

(b) In the absence of other information, the following characteristics are appropriate to consider when selecting the engine to test:

(1) Maximum fueling rates.

(2) Maximum loads.

(3) Maximum in-use speeds.

(4) Highest sales volume.

(c) For our testing, we may select any engine configuration within the engine family.
