Such capabilities shall include access for inspection and monitoring by regulatory officials and the authority to establish operator monitoring and reporting requirements.

(c) Shall make use of a permit program which ensures that the establishment of new open dumps is prohibited.

(d) Shall have administrative and judicial enforcement capabilities, including enforceable orders, fines or other administrative procedures, as necessary to ensure compliance.
