###### § 52.1601 Control strategy and regulations: Sulfur oxides.

(a) The applicable limitation on the sulfur content of fuel marketed and used in New Jersey until and including March 15, 1974, as set forth in N.J.A.C. subchapter 7:1-3.1 is approved, except that the use of coal in the following utility plants and boiler units is not approved:

(b) Before any steam or electric power generating facility in Zone 3, as defined in N.J.A.C. 7:27-10.1, burning fuel oil on June 4, 1979, having a rated hourly gross heat input greater than 200,000,000 British Thermal Units (BTU's), and capable of burning coal without major reconstruction or construction, which facility was in operation prior to May 6, 1968, or group of such facilities having a combined rated hourly capacity greater than 450,000,000 BTU's may be permitted by the State to convert to the use of coal, the State shall submit to EPA a copy of the proposed permit together with an air quality analysis employing methodology acceptable to EPA. If EPA determines, on the basis of the submitted analysis, that the proposed coal conversion will not interfere with the attainment or maintenance of air quality standards and will not be the cause for any Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increment to be exceeded, then the permit authorizing conversion may become effective immediately upon the publication of such a determination (as a Notice) in theIf EPA determines that the submitted analysis is inadequate or that it shows that the proposed conversion will interfere with attainment or maintenance of air quality standards or cause any PSD increment to be exceeded, then EPA shall so inform the State of its determination, and the permit authorizing conversion shall not become effective and conversion shall not occur until an adequate analysis is submitted or, if necessary, until a control strategy revision which would require any necessary emission reductions is submitted by the State and placed into effect as an EPA approved revision to the implementation plan. In addition, this same procedure shall apply to any State permit applied for that would authorize a relaxation in the sulfur-in-coal limitation at any such facility, as defined above in this paragraph, having already been granted a permit to convert to coal.

(c) The U.S. Gypsum Co. in Clark, New Jersey is permitted to burn fuel oil with a sulfur content of 2.0 percent, by weight, at either Boiler #1, #2 or #3 until March 31, 1985 or until Boiler #4 is ready to burn coal, whichever occurs first. Such oil burning must conform with New Jersey requirements and conditions as set forth in applicable regulations and administrative orders.
