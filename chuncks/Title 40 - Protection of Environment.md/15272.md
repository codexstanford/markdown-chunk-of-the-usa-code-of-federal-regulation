###### § 52.2589 Wisconsin construction permit permanency revision.

This plan was originally submitted as Wis. Stat. 144.396 by Wisconsin on July 12, 1979 and approved into Wisconsin's SIP on June 25, 1986 (51 FR 23056). Wis. Stat. 144.396 was renumbered Wis. Stat. 285.66 in 1995 Wisconsin Act 227, effective January 1, 1997. On December 8, 2005, Wisconsin submitted for EPA approval into the Wisconsin SIP a revision to Wis. Stats. 285.66(l), as amended in 2005 Wisconsin Act 25, effective July 26, 2005. This revision makes all conditions in Wisconsin's construction permits permanent. EPA has determined that this statutory revision is approvable under the Act.
