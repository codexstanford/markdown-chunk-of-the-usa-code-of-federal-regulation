#### PART 50 - NATIONAL PRIMARY AND SECONDARY AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS
##### § 50.2 Scope.

(a) National primary and secondary ambient air quality standards under section 109 of the Act are set forth in this part.

(b) National primary ambient air quality standards define levels of air quality which the Administrator judges are necessary, with an adequate margin of safety, to protect the public health. National secondary ambient air quality standards define levels of air quality which the Administrator judges necessary to protect the public welfare from any known or anticipated adverse effects of a pollutant. Such standards are subject to revision, and additional primary and secondary standards may be promulgated as the Administrator deems necessary to protect the public health and welfare.

(c) The promulgation of national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards shall not be considered in any manner to allow significant deterioration of existing air quality in any portion of any State or Indian country.

(d) The proposal, promulgation, or revision of national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards shall not prohibit any State or Indian country from establishing ambient air quality standards for that State or area under a tribal CAA program or any portion thereof which are more stringent than the national standards.
