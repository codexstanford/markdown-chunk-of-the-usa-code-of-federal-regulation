The Environmental Protection Agency first adopted emission standards for freshly manufactured and remanufactured locomotives under this part in 1998. EPA has migrated regulatory requirements for these engines to 40 CFR part 1033, with additional testing and compliance provisions in 40 CFR parts 1065 and 1068. The Tier 0, Tier 1, and Tier 2 standards originally adopted in this part are identified in 40 CFR part 1033, appendix I. See 40 CFR 1033.1 for information regarding the timing of the transition to 40 CFR part 1033, and for information regarding regulations that continue to apply for engines that manufacturers originally certified or otherwise produced or remanufactured under this part. Emission standards started to apply for locomotive and locomotive engines if they were-

(a) Manufactured on or after January 1, 2000;

(b) Manufactured on or after January 1, 1973 and remanufactured on or after January 1, 2000; or

(c) Manufactured before January 1, 1973 and upgraded on or after January 1, 2000.
