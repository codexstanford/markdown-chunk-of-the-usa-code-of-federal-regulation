#### PART 60 - STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR NEW STATIONARY SOURCES
##### Subpart FFFF - Emission Guidelines and Compliance Times for Other Solid Waste Incineration Units That Commenced Construction On or Before December 9, 2004
###### Introduction
####### § 60.2988 Are there any State plan requirements for this subpart that apply instead of the requirements specified in subpart B of this part?

Yes, subpart B of this part establishes general requirements for developing and processing section 111(d) plans. This subpart applies instead of the requirements in subpart B of this part for the following:

(a) State plans developed to implement this subpart must be as protective as the emission guidelines contained in this subpart. State plans must require all OSWI units and air curtain incinerators subject to this subpart as described in § 60.2994(b) to comply by December 16, 2010 or 3 years after the effective date of State plan approval, whichever is sooner. This applies instead of the option for case-by-case less stringent emission standards and longer compliance schedules in § 60.24(f).

(b) State plans developed to implement this subpart are required to include only one increment of progress for the affected incineration units. This increment is the final compliance date in § 60.21(h)(5). This applies instead of the requirement of § 60.24(e)(1).
