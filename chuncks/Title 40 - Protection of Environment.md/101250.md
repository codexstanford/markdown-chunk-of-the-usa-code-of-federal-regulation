###### Percent speed

(2)means the percentage of Maximum Test Speed.

(b) Figure 1 of this Appendix illustrates the default NTE zone for marine engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(1), except for variable-speed propulsion marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers, as follows:

(1) Subzone 1 is defined by the following boundaries:

(i) Percent power &#xF7; 100 > 0.7 &#xB7; (percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(ii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 &#x2264; (percent speed &#xF7; 90).

(iii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 ≥ 3.0 &#xB7; (1-percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(2) Subzone 2 is defined by the following boundaries:

(i) Percent power &#xF7; 100 ≥ 0.7 &#xB7; (percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(ii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 &#x2264; (percent speed &#xF7; 90).

(iii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 < 3.0 &#xB7; (1-percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(iv) Percent speed &#xF7; 100 ≥ 0.7.

(3) Note that the line separating Subzone 1 and Subzone 2 includes the following endpoints:

(i) Percent speed = 78.9 percent; Percent power = 63.2 percent.

(ii) Percent speed = 84.6 percent; Percent power = 46.1 percent.

(c) Figure 2 of this Appendix illustrates the default NTE zone for recreational marine engines certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(2), except for variable-speed marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers, as follows:

(1) Subzone 1 is defined by the following boundaries:

(i) Percent power &#xF7; 100 ≥ 0.7 &#xB7; (percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(ii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 &#x2264; (percent speed &#xF7; 90).

(iii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 ≥ 3.0 &#xB7; (1-percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(iv) Percent power &#x2264; 95 percent.

(2) Subzone 2 is defined by the following boundaries:

(i) Percent power &#xF7; 100 ≥ 0.7 &#xB7; (percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(ii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 &#x2264; (percent speed &#xF7; 90).

(iii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 < 3.0 &#xB7; (1-percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(iv) Percent speed ≥ 70 percent.

(3) Subzone 3 is defined by the following boundaries:

(i) Percent power &#xF7; 100 &#x2264; (percent speed &#xF7; 90).

(ii) Percent power > 95 percent.

(4) Note that the line separating Subzone 1 and Subzone 3 includes a point at Percent speed = 88.7 percent and Percent power = 95.0 percent. See paragraph (b)(3) of this appendix regarding the line separating Subzone 1 and Subzone 2.

(d) Figure 3 of this Appendix illustrates the default NTE zone for variable-speed marine engines used with controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers that are certified using the duty cycle specified in § 1042.505(b)(1), (2), or (3), as follows:

(1) Subzone 1 is defined by the following boundaries:

(i) Percent power &#xF7; 100 ≥ 0.7 &#xB7; (percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(ii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 ≥ 3.0 &#xB7; (1-percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(iii) Percent speed ≥ 78.9 percent.

(2) Subzone 2a is defined by the following boundaries:

(i) Percent power &#xF7; 100 ≥ 0.7 &#xB7; (percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(ii) Percent speed ≥70 percent.

(iii) Percent speed <78.9 percent, for Percent power >63.3 percent.

(iv) Percent power &#xF7; 100 <3.0 &#xB7; (1-percent speed &#xF7; 100), for Percent speed ≥78.9 percent.

(3) Subzone 2b is defined by the following boundaries:

(i) The line formed by connecting the following two points on a plot of speed-vs.-power:

(A) Percent speed = 70 percent; Percent power = 28.7 percent.

(B) Percent power = 40 percent; Speed = governed speed.

(ii) Percent power &#xF7; 100 < 0.7 &#xB7; (percent speed &#xF7; 100).

(4) Note that the line separating Subzone 1 and Subzone 2a includes the following endpoints:

(i) Percent speed = 78.9 percent; Percent power = 63.3 percent.

(ii) Percent speed = 84.6 percent; Percent power = 46.1 percent.
