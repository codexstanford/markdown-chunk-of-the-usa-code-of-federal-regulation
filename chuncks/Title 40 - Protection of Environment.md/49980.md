############### § 97.342 CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocations.

(a)(1) The baseline heat input (in mmBtu) used with respect to CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocations under paragraph (b) of this section for each CAIR NOOzone Season unit will be:

(i) For units commencing operation before January 1, 2001 the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's adjusted control period heat input for 2000 through 2004, with the adjusted control period heat input for each year calculated as follows:

(A) If the unit is coal-fired during the year, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 100 percent;

(B) If the unit is oil-fired during the year, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 60 percent; and

(C) If the unit is not subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, the unit's control period heat input for such year is multiplied by 40 percent.

(ii) For units commencing operation on or after January 1, 2001 and operating each calendar year during a period of 5 or more consecutive calendar years, the average of the 3 highest amounts of the unit's total converted control period heat input over the first such 5 years.

(2)(i) A unit's control period heat input, and a unit's status as coal-fired or oil-fired, for a calendar year under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and a unit's total tons of NOemissions during a control period in a calendar year under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, will be determined in accordance with part 75 of this chapter, to the extent the unit was otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the year, or will be based on the best available data reported to the Administrator for the unit (in a format prescribed by the Administrator), to the extent the unit was not otherwise subject to the requirements of part 75 of this chapter for the year.

(ii) A unit's converted control period heat input for a calendar year specified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section equals:

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, the control period gross electrical output of the generator or generators served by the unit multiplied by 7,900 Btu/kWh, if the unit is coal-fired for the year, or 6,675 Btu/kWh, if the unit is not coal-fired for the year, and divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu, provided that if a generator is served by 2 or more units, then the gross electrical output of the generator will be attributed to each unit in proportion to the unit's share of the total control period heat input of such units for the year;

(B) For a unit that is a boiler and has equipment used to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by the boiler during the control period, divided by 0.8 and by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu; or

(C) For a unit that is a combustion turbine and has equipment used to produce electricity and useful thermal energy for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes through the sequential use of energy, the control period gross electrical output of the enclosed device comprising the compressor, combustor, and turbine multiplied by 3,413 Btu/kWh, plus the total heat energy (in Btu) of the steam produced by any associated heat recovery steam generator during the control period divided by 0.8, and with the sum divided by 1,000,000 Btu/mmBtu.

(iii) Gross electrical output and total heat energy under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section will be determined based on the best available data reported to the Administrator for the unit (in a format prescribed by the Administrator).

(3) The Administrator will determine what data are the best available data under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by weighing the likelihood that data are accurate and reliable and giving greater weight to data submitted to a governmental entity in compliance with legal requirements or substantiated by an independent entity.

(b)(1) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the Administrator will allocate to all CAIR NOOzone Season units in a State that have a baseline heat input (as determined under paragraph (a) of this section) a total amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances equal to 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the tons of NOemissions in the applicable State trading budget under § 97.340 (except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).

(2) The Administrator will allocate CAIR NOOzone Season allowances to each CAIR NOOzone Season unit under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in an amount determined by multiplying the total amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances allocated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the ratio of the baseline heat input of such CAIR NOOzone Season unit to the total amount of baseline heat input of all such CAIR NOOzone Season units in the State and rounding to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(c) For each control period in 2009 and thereafter, the Administrator will allocate CAIR NOOzone Season allowances to CAIR NOOzone Season units in a State that are not allocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances under paragraph (b) of this section because the units do not yet have a baseline heat input under paragraph (a) of this section or because the units have a baseline heat input but all CAIR NOOzone Season allowances available under paragraph (b) of this section for the control period are already allocated, in accordance with the following procedures:

(1) The Administrator will establish a separate new unit set-aside for each control period. Each new unit set-aside will be allocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances equal to 5 percent for a control period in 2009 through 2014, and 3 percent for a control period in 2015 and thereafter, of the amount of tons of NOemissions in the applicable State trading budget under § 97.340.

(2) The CAIR designated representative of such a CAIR NOOzone Season unit may submit to the Administrator a request, in a format specified by the Administrator, to be allocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances, starting with the later of the control period in 2009 or the first control period after the control period in which the CAIR NOOzone Season unit commences commercial operation and until the first control period for which the unit is allocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances under paragraph (b) of this section. A separate CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocation request for each control period for which CAIR NOOzone Season allowances are sought must be submitted on or before February 1 before such control period and after the date on which the CAIR NOOzone Season unit commences commercial operation.

(3) In a CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the CAIR designated representative may request for a control period CAIR NOOzone Season allowances in an amount not exceeding the CAIR NOOzone Season unit(s total tons of NOemissions during the control period immediately before such control period.

(4) The Administrator will review each CAIR NOOzone Season allowance allocation request under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and will allocate CAIR NOOzone Season allowances for each control period pursuant to such request as follows:

(i) The Administrator will accept an allowance allocation request only if the request meets, or is adjusted by the Administrator as necessary to meet, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section.

(ii) On or after February 1 before the control period, the Administrator will determine the sum of the CAIR NOOzone Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) in all allowance allocation requests accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section for the control period.

(iii) If the amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is greater than or equal to the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Administrator will allocate the amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section) to each CAIR NOOzone Season unit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.

(iv) If the amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period is less than the sum under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, then the Administrator will allocate to each CAIR NOOzone Season unit covered by an allowance allocation request accepted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section the amount of the CAIR NOOzone Season allowances requested (as adjusted under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section), multiplied by the amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances in the new unit set-aside for the control period, divided by the sum determined under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(v) The Administrator will notify each CAIR designated representative that submitted an allowance allocation request of the amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances (if any) allocated for the control period to the CAIR NOOzone Season unit covered by the request.

(d) If, after completion of the procedures under paragraph (c)(4) of this section for a control period, any unallocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances remain in the new unit set-aside under paragraph (c) of this section for a State for the control period, the Administrator will allocate to each CAIR NOOzone Season unit that was allocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances under paragraph (b) of this section in the State an amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances equal to the total amount of such remaining unallocated CAIR NOOzone Season allowances, multiplied by the unit's allocation under paragraph (b) of this section, divided by 95 percent for a control period during 2009 through 2014, and 97 percent for a control period during 2015 and thereafter, of the amount of tons of NOemissions in the applicable State trading budget under § 97.340, and rounded to the nearest whole allowance as appropriate.

(e) If the Administrator determines that CAIR NOOzone Season allowances were allocated under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, or paragraph (d) of this section for a control period and that the recipient of the allocation is not actually a CAIR NOOzone Season unit under § 97.304 in such control period, then the Administrator will notify the CAIR designated representative and will act in accordance with the following procedures:

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section, the Administrator will not record such CAIR NOOzone Season allowances under § 97.353.

(2) If the Administrator already recorded such CAIR NOOzone Season allowances under § 97.353 and if the Administrator makes such determinations before making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.354(b) for the control period, then the Administrator will deduct from the account in which such CAIR NOOzone Season allowances were recorded under § 97.353 an amount of CAIR NOOzone Season allowances allocated for the same or a prior control period equal to the amount of such already recorded CAIR NOOzone Season allowances. The CAIR designated representative shall ensure that there are sufficient CAIR NOOzone Season allowances in such account for completion of the deduction.

(3) If the Administrator already recorded such CAIR NOOzone Season allowances under § 97.353 and if the Administrator makes such determinations after making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.354(b) for the control period, then the Administrator will apply paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate, to any subsequent control period for which CAIR NOOzone Season allowances were allocated to such recipient.

(4) The Administrator will transfer the CAIR NOOzone Season allowances that are not recorded, or that are deducted, in accordance with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), and (3) of this section to a new unit set-aside for the State in which such recipient is located.
