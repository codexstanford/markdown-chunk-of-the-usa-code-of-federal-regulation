#### PART 109 - CRITERIA FOR STATE, LOCAL AND REGIONAL OIL REMOVAL CONTINGENCY PLANS
##### § 109.3 Purpose and scope.

The guidelines in this part establish minimum criteria for the development and implementation of State, local, and regional contingency plans by State and local governments in consultation with private interests to insure timely, efficient, coordinated and effective action to minimize damage resulting from oil discharges. Such plans will be directed toward the protection of the public health or welfare of the United States, including, but not limited to, fish, shellfish, wildlife, and public and private property, shorelines, and beaches. The development and implementation of such plans shall be consistent with the National Oil and Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan. State, local and regional oil removal contingency plans shall provide for the coordination of the total response to an oil discharge so that contingency organizations established thereunder can function independently, in conjunction with each other, or in conjunction with the National and Regional Response Teams established by the National Oil and Hazardous Materials Pollution Contingency Plan.
