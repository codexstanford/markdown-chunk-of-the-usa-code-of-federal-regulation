(d) In the event the Administrator or the Regional Administrator, as the case may be, determines that a request filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section does not comply with the requirements of such paragraph (a) of this section or that such request does not present substantial issues of public interest, he shall advise, in writing, the person requesting the adjudicatory hearing of his determination.

(e) Any person requesting an adjudicatory hearing or requesting admission as a party to an adjudicatory hearing shall state in his written request, and shall by filing such request consent, that he and his employees and agents shall submit themselves to direct and cross-examination at any such hearing and to the taking of an oath administered by the Presiding Officer.
