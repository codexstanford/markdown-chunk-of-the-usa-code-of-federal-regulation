###### § 300.525 State involvement in removal actions.

(a) States may undertake Fund-financed removal actions pursuant to a cooperative agreement with EPA. State-lead removal actions taken pursuant to cooperative agreements must be conducted in accordance with § 300.415 on removal actions, and 40 CFR part 35, subpart O.

(b) States are not required under section 104(c)(3) of CERCLA to share in the cost of a Fund-financed removal action, unless the removal is conducted at an NPL site that was operated by a state or political subdivision at the time of disposal of hazardous substances therein and a Fund-financed remedial action is ultimately undertaken at the site. In this situation, states are required to share, 50 percent or greater, in the cost of all removal (including remedial planning) and remedial action costs at the time of the remedial action.

(c) States are encouraged to provide for post-removal site control as discussed in § 300.415(k) for all Fund-financed removal actions.

(d) States shall be responsible for identifying potential state ARARs for all Fund-financed removal actions and for providing such ARARs to EPA in a timely manner for all EPA-lead removal actions.

(e) EPA shall consult with a state on all removal actions to be conducted in that state.
