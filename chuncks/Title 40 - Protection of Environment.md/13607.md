(h) Approval-On January 5, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for the 1990 base year emission inventory. The inventory was submitted by the State of Michigan to satisfy Federal requirements under section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, as a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor moderate ozone nonattainment area. This area includes Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties.

(i) Approval-On November 12, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a request to redesignate the Detroit-Ann Arbor (consisting of Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties) ozone nonattainment area to attainment for ozone. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1993 attainment year) emission inventory for NOand VOC, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories (including interim years) to the year 2005 for NOand VOC, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the ozone NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. Appropriateness of a contingency measure will be determined by an urban airshed modeling analysis. The Governor or his designee will select the contingency measure(s) to be implemented based on the analysis and the MDNR's recommendation. The menu of contingency measures includes basic motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program upgrades, Stage I vapor recovery expansion, Stage II vapor recovery, intensified RACT for degreasing operations, NORACT, and RVP reduction to 7.8 psi. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Michigan Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned counties.

(j) [Reserved]

(k) Determination-USEPA is determining that, as of July 20, 1995, the Grand Rapids and Muskegon ozone nonattainment areas have attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the areas for so long as the areas do not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in either the Grand Rapids or Muskegon ozone nonattainment area, the determination shall no longer apply for the area that experiences the violation.

(l) Approval-EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen (NO) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general conformity exemptions for the Grand Rapids (Kent and Ottawa Counties) and Muskegon (Muskegon County) moderate nonattainment areas as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal.
