###### § 52.1834 Minor source permit to operate program.

Emission limitations and related provisions, which, in accordance with Rule 33-15-14-03, are established as federally enforceable conditions in North Dakota minor source operating permits, shall be enforceable by EPA. EPA reserves the right to deem permit conditions not federally enforceable. Such a determination will be made according to appropriate procedures and will be based upon the permit, permit approval procedures, or permit requirements which do not conform with the operating permit program requirements of EPA's underlying regulations.
