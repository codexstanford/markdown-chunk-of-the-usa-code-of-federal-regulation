####### § 63.4530 What records must I keep?

You must collect and keep records of the data and information specified in this section. Failure to collect and keep these records is a deviation from the applicable standard.

(a) A copy of each notification and report that you submitted to comply with this subpart, and the documentation supporting each notification and report. If you are using the predominant activity alternative under § 63.4490(c), you must keep records of the data and calculations used to determine the predominant activity. If you are using the facility-specific emission limit alternative under § 63.4490(c), you must keep records of the data used to calculate the facility-specific emission limit for the initial compliance demonstration. You must also keep records of any data used in each annual predominant activity determination and in the calculation of the facility-specific emission limit for each 12-month compliance period included in the semi-annual compliance reports.

(b) A current copy of information provided by materials suppliers or manufacturers, such as manufacturer's formulation data, or test data used to determine the mass fraction of organic HAP and density for each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material, and the mass fraction of coating solids for each coating. If you conducted testing to determine mass fraction of organic HAP, density, or mass fraction of coating solids, you must keep a copy of the complete test report. If you use information provided to you by the manufacturer or supplier of the material that was based on testing, you must keep the summary sheet of results provided to you by the manufacturer or supplier. You are not required to obtain the test report or other supporting documentation from the manufacturer or supplier.

(c) For each compliance period, the records specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.

(1) A record of the coating operations on which you used each compliance option and the time periods (beginning and ending dates and times) for each option you used.

(2) For the compliant material option, a record of the calculation of the organic HAP content for each coating, using Equation 1 of § 63.4541.

(3) For the emission rate without add-on controls option, a record of the calculation of the total mass of organic HAP emissions for the coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used each month using Equations 1, 1A through 1C, and 2 of § 63.4551 and, if applicable, the calculation used to determine mass of organic HAP in waste materials according to § 63.4551(e)(4); the calculation of the total mass of coating solids used each month using Equation 2 of § 63.4551; and the calculation of each 12-month organic HAP emission rate using Equation 3 of § 63.4551.

(4) For the emission rate with add-on controls option, records of the calculations specified in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (v) of this section.

(i) The calculation of the total mass of organic HAP emissions for the coatings, thinners and/or other additives, and cleaning materials used each month using Equations 1 and 1A through 1C of § 63.4551; and, if applicable, the calculation used to determine mass of organic HAP in waste materials according to § 63.4551(e)(4);

(ii) The calculation of the total mass of coating solids used each month using Equation 2 of § 63.4551;

(iii) The calculation of the mass of organic HAP emission reduction by emission capture systems and add-on control devices using Equations 1 and 1A through 1D of § 63.4561 and Equations 2, 3, and 3A through 3C of § 63.4561, as applicable;

(iv) The calculation of each month's organic HAP emission rate using Equation 4 of § 63.4561; and

(v) The calculation of each 12-month organic HAP emission rate using Equation 5 of § 63.4561.

(d) A record of the name and mass of each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each compliance period. If you are using the compliant material option for all coatings at the source, you may maintain purchase records for each material used rather than a record of the mass used.

(e) A record of the mass fraction of organic HAP for each coating, thinner and/or other additive, and cleaning material used during each compliance period.

(f) A record of the mass fraction of coating solids for each coating used during each compliance period.

(g) If you use an allowance in Equation 1 of § 63.4551 for organic HAP contained in waste materials sent to or designated for shipment to a treatment, storage, and disposal facility (TSDF) according to § 63.4551(e)(4), you must keep records of the information specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) The name and address of each TSDF to which you sent waste materials for which you use an allowance in Equation 1 of § 63.4551, a statement of which subparts under 40 CFR parts 262, 264, 265, and 266 apply to the facility; and the date of each shipment.

(2) Identification of the coating operations producing waste materials included in each shipment and the month or months in which you used the allowance for these materials in Equation 1 of § 63.4551.

(3) The methodology used in accordance with § 63.4551(e)(4) to determine the total amount of waste materials sent to or the amount collected, stored, and designated for transport to a TSDF each month; and the methodology to determine the mass of organic HAP contained in these waste materials. This must include the sources for all data used in the determination, methods used to generate the data, frequency of testing or monitoring, and supporting calculations and documentation, including the waste manifest for each shipment.

(h) Before January 5, 2021, you must keep records of the date, time, and duration of each deviation. On and after January 5, 2021, for each deviation from an emission limitation reported under § 63.4520(a)(5) through (7), a record of the information specified in paragraphs (h)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable.

(1) The date, time, and duration of the deviation, as reported under § 63.4520(a)(5) through (7).

(2) A list of the affected sources or equipment for which the deviation occurred and the cause of the deviation, as reported under § 63.4520(a)(5) through (7).

(3) An estimate of the quantity of each regulated pollutant emitted over any applicable emission limit in § 63.4490 or any applicable operating limit in Table 1 to this subpart, and a description of the method used to calculate the estimate, as reported under § 63.4520(a)(5) through (7).

(4) A record of actions taken to minimize emissions in accordance with § 63.4500(b) and any corrective actions taken to return the affected unit to its normal or usual manner of operation.

(i) If you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, you must also keep the records specified in paragraphs (i)(1) through (8) of this section.

(1) Before January 5, 2021, for each deviation, a record of whether the deviation occurred during a period of SSM. On and after January 5, 2021, a record of whether the deviation occurred during a period of SSM is not required.

(2) Before January 5, 2021, the records in § 63.6(e)(3)(iii) through (v) related to SSM. On and after January 5, 2021, the records in § 63.6(e)(3)(iii) through (v) related to SSM are not required.

(3) The records required to show continuous compliance with each operating limit specified in Table 1 to this subpart that applies to you.

(4) For each capture system that is a PTE, the data and documentation you used to support a determination that the capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and has a capture efficiency of 100 percent, as specified in § 63.4565(a).

(5) For each capture system that is not a PTE, the data and documentation you used to determine capture efficiency according to the requirements specified in §§ 63.4564 and 63.4565(b) through (e), including the records specified in paragraphs (i)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section that apply to you.
