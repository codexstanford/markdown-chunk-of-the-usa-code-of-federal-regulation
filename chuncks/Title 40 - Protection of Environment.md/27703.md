###### § 63.706 Recordkeeping requirements.

(a) Except as stipulated in § 63.703 (b), (c)(5), and (h), the owner or operator of a magnetic tape manufacturing operation subject to this subpart shall fulfill all applicable recordkeeping requirements in § 63.10 of subpart A, as outlined in Table 1.

(b) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart that is also subject to the requirements of § 63.703(e)(1)(ii) (a minimum freeboard ratio of 75 percent), shall record whether or not the minimum freeboard ratio has been achieved every time that HAP solvent is added to the wash sink. A measurement of the actual ratio is not necessary for each record as long as the owner or operator has a reliable method for making the required determination. For example, the record may be made by comparing the HAP solvent level to a permanent mark on the sink that corresponds to a 75 percent freeboard ratio. A HAP solvent level in the sink higher than the mark would indicate the minimum ratio has not been achieved.

(c) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to this subpart that is subject to the requirements of § 63.704(c)(10) shall:

(1) If complying with § 63.704(c)(10)(i), maintain hourly records of whether the flow indicator was operating and whether flow was detected at any time during the hour, as well as records of the times and durations of all periods when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the monitor is not operating;

(2) If complying with § 63.704(c)(10) (ii), (iii), or (iv), maintain a record of monthly inspections, and the records of the times and durations of all periods when:

(i) Flow was diverted through any bypass line such that the seal mechanism was broken;

(ii) The key for a lock-and-key type lock had been checked out;

(iii) The valve position on any bypass line changed to the open position; or

(iv) The diversion of flow through any bypass line caused a shutdown of HAP-emitting operations.

(d) The owner or operator of an affected source that is complying with § 63.703(c) by performing a material balance in accordance with § 63.705(c)(1) shall:

(1) Maintain a record of each 7-day rolling average calculation; and

(2) Maintain a record of the certification of the accuracy of the device that measures the amount of HAP or VOC recovered.

(e) The owner or operator of a magnetic tape manufacturing operation subject to the provisions of § 63.703 (b) and (h) shall maintain records of the calculations used to determine the limits on the amount of HAP utilized as specified in § 63.703(b)(2), and of the HAP utilized in each month and the sum over each 12-month period.

(f) The owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of § 63.703(c)(5) shall keep records of the HAP content of each batch of coating applied as calculated according to § 63.705(c)(5), and records of the formulation data that support the calculations. When a batch of coating applied is identical to a previous batch applied, only one set of records is required to be kept.

(g) The owner or operator of an affected source that is complying with § 63.703(c)(1) through the use of a nonregenerative carbon adsorber and demonstrating initial compliance in accordance with § 63.705(c)(6) shall maintain records to support the outlet VOC or HAP concentration value or the carbon replacement time established as the site-specific operating parameter to demonstrate compliance.

(h) In accordance with § 63.10(b)(1) of subpart A, the owner or operator of an affected source subject to the provisions of this subpart shall retain all records required by this subpart and subpart A for at least 5 years following their collection.
