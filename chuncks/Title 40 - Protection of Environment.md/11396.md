###### § 52.346 Air quality monitoring requirements.

In a letter and submittal dated July 7, 1993, from the Governor of Colorado to the EPA Region VIII Administrator, the State submitted a revised Air Quality Monitoring State Implementation Plan. The plan was adopted by the State on March 18, 1993, and completely replaces the previous version of the Air Quality Monitoring plan as identified at 40 CFR 52.320 (c)(17). The revisions updated the plan to bring it into conformance with the Federal requirements for air quality monitoring as found in 40 CFR part 58. The State commits to meet these Federal requirements.
