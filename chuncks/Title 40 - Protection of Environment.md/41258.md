###### § 68.152 Substantiating claims of confidential business information.

(a) An owner or operator claiming that information is confidential business information must substantiate that claim by providing documentation that demonstrates that the claim meets the substantive criteria set forth in 40 CFR 2.301.

(b) Information that is submitted as part of the substantiation may be claimed confidential by marking it as confidential business information. Information not so marked will be treated as public and may be disclosed without notice to the submitter. If information that is submitted as part of the substantiation is claimed confidential, the owner or operator must provide a sanitized and unsanitized version of the substantiation.

(c) The owner, operator, or senior official with management responsibility of the stationary source shall sign a certification that the signer has personally examined the information submitted and that based on inquiry of the persons who compiled the information, the information is true, accurate, and complete, and that those portions of the substantiation claimed as confidential business information would, if disclosed, reveal trade secrets or other confidential business information.
