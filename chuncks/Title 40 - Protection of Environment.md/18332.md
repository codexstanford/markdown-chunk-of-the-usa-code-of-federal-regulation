###### § 60.166 Test methods and procedures.

(a) In conducting performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).

(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO) and visible emission standards in §§ 60.162, 60.163, and 60.164 as follows:

(1) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration. The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf).

(2) The continuous monitoring system of § 60.165(b)(2) shall be used to determine the SOconcentrations on a dry basis. The sampling time for each run shall be 6 hours, and the average SOconcentration shall be computed for the 6-hour period as in § 60.165(c). The monitoring system drift during the run may not exceed 2 percent of the span value.

(3) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.
