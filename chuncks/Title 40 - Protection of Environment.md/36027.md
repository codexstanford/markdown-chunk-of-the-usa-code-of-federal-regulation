###### Calculating Organic HAP Emissions Factors for Open Molding and Centrifugal Casting
####### § 63.5796 What are the organic HAP emissions factor equations in Table 1 to this subpart, and how are they used in this subpart?

Emissions factors are used in this subpart to determine compliance with certain organic HAP emissions limits in Tables 3 and 5 to this subpart. You may use the equations in Table 1 to this subpart to calculate your emissions factors. Equations are available for each open molding operation and centrifugal casting operation and have units of pounds of organic HAP emitted per ton (lb/ton) of resin or gel coat applied. These equations are intended to provide a method for you to demonstrate compliance without the need to conduct for a HAP emissions test. In lieu of these equations, you can elect to use site-specific organic HAP emissions factors to demonstrate compliance provided your site-specific organic HAP emissions factors are incorporated in the facility's air emissions permit and are based on actual facility HAP emissions test data. You may also use the organic HAP emissions factors calculated using the equations in Table 1 to this subpart, combined with resin and gel coat use data, to calculate your organic HAP emissions.
