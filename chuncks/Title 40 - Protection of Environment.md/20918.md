###### Testing Requirements for Owners and Operators
####### § 60.4212 What test methods and other procedures must I use if I am an owner or operator of a stationary CI internal combustion engine with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder?

Owners and operators of stationary CI ICE with a displacement of less than 30 liters per cylinder who conduct performance tests pursuant to this subpart must do so according to paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.

(a) The performance test must be conducted according to the in-use testing procedures in 40 CFR part 1039, subpart F, for stationary CI ICE with a displacement of less than 10 liters per cylinder, and according to 40 CFR part 1042, subpart F, for stationary CI ICE with a displacement of greater than or equal to 10 liters per cylinder and less than 30 liters per cylinder. Alternatively, stationary CI ICE that are complying with Tier 2 or Tier 3 emission standards as described in 40 CFR part 1039, appendix I, or with Tier 2 emission standards as described in 40 CFR part 1042, appendix I, may follow the testing procedures specified in § 60.4213, as appropriate.

(b) Exhaust emissions from stationary CI ICE that are complying with the emission standards for new CI engines in 40 CFR part 1039 must not exceed the not-to-exceed (NTE) standards for the same model year and maximum engine power as required in 40 CFR 1039.101(e) and 40 CFR 1039.102(g)(1), except as specified in 40 CFR 1039.104(d). This requirement starts when NTE requirements take effect for nonroad diesel engines under 40 CFR part 1039.

(c) Exhaust emissions from stationary CI ICE subject to Tier 2 or Tier 3 emission standards as described in 40 CFR part 1039, appendix I, or Tier 2 emission standards as described in 40 CFR part 1042, appendix I, must not exceed the NTE numerical requirements, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the applicable standard, determined from the following equation:

(d) Exhaust emissions from stationary CI ICE that are complying with the emission standards for pre-2007 model year engines in § 60.4204(a), § 60.4205(a), or § 60.4205(c) must not exceed the NTE numerical requirements, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the applicable standard in § 60.4204(a), § 60.4205(a), or § 60.4205(c), determined from the equation in paragraph (c) of this section.

Alternatively, stationary CI ICE that are complying with the emission standards for pre-2007 model year engines in § 60.4204(a), § 60.4205(a), or § 60.4205(c) may follow the testing procedures specified in § 60.4213, as appropriate.

(e) Exhaust emissions from stationary CI ICE that are complying with the emission standards for new CI engines in 40 CFR part 1042 must not exceed the NTE standards for the same model year and maximum engine power as required in 40 CFR 1042.101(c).
