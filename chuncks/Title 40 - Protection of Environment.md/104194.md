###### § 1068.601 Overview.

The regulations of this chapter involve numerous provisions that may result in EPA making a decision or judgment that you may consider adverse to your interests. For example, our decisions might require you to pay penalties, or you might consider that our decisions will limit your business activities or put you at a competitive disadvantage. As specified in the regulations in this chapter, this might involve an opportunity for an informal hearing or a formal hearing that follows specific procedures and is directed by a Presiding Officer. The regulations in this chapter generally specify when we would hold a hearing. In limited circumstances, we may grant a request for a hearing related to adverse decisions regarding regulatory provisions for which we do not specifically describe the possibility of asking for a hearing.
