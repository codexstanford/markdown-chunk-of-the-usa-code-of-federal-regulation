###### § 60.535 What procedures must I use for EPA approval of a test laboratory or EPA approval of a third-party certifier?
####### Revocation of third-party certifier approval.

(e)(1) The Administrator will revoke a third-party certifier's EPA approval if it is determined that the certifier;

(i) Is no longer accredited by the accreditation body;

(ii) Does not follow required procedures or practices; or

(iii) Has falsified certification data or otherwise misrepresented emission data.

(2) Revocation of approval under this paragraph (e) will not take effect until the certifier concerned is given written notice by the Administrator setting forth the basis for the proposed determination and an opportunity for a hearing under § 60.539. However, if revocation is upheld, all certifications by the certifier after written notice was given will, at the discretion of the Administrator, be declared invalid.
