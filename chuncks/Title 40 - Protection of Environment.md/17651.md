#### PART 60 - STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR NEW STATIONARY SOURCES
##### Subpart Da - Standards of Performance for Electric Utility Steam Generating Units
###### § 60.42Da Standards for particulate matter (PM).
############# § 60.44Da Standards for nitrogen oxides (NO).

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any affected facility for which construction, reconstruction, or modification commenced before July 10, 1997 any gases that contain NO(expressed as NO) in excess of the applicable emissions limit in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain NOin excess of the emissions limit listed in the following table as applicable to the fuel type combusted and as determined on a 30-boiler operating day rolling average basis.

(2) When two or more fuels are combusted simultaneously in an affected facility, the applicable emissions limit (E) is determined by proration using the following formula:

(b)-(c) [Reserved]

(d) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification after July 9, 1997, but before March 1, 2005, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain NO(expressed as NO) in excess of the applicable emissions limit specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section as determined on a 30-boiler operating day rolling average basis.

(1) For an affected facility which commenced construction, any gases that contain NOin excess of 200 ng/J (1.6 lb/MWh) gross energy output.

(2) For an affected facility which commenced reconstruction, any gases that contain NOin excess of 65 ng/J (0.15 lb/MMBtu) heat input.

(e) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005 but before May 4, 2011, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain NO(expressed as NO) in excess of the applicable emissions limit specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section as determined on a 30-boiler operating day rolling average basis.

(1) For an affected facility which commenced construction, any gases that contain NOin excess of 130 ng/J (1.0 lb/MWh) gross energy output.

(2) For an affected facility which commenced reconstruction, any gases that contain NOin excess of either:

(i) 130 ng/J (1.0 lb/MWh) gross energy output; or

(ii) 47 ng/J (0.11 lb/MMBtu) heat input.

(3) For an affected facility which commenced modification, any gases that contain NOin excess of either:

(i) 180 ng/J (1.4 lb/MWh) gross energy output; or

(ii) 65 ng/J (0.15 lb/MMBtu) heat input.

(f) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, the owner or operator of an IGCC electric utility steam generating unit subject to the provisions of this subpart and for which construction, reconstruction, or modification commenced after February 28, 2005 but before May 4, 2011, shall meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) Except as provided for in paragraphs (f)(2) and (3) of this section, the owner or operator shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain NO(expressed as NO) in excess of 130 ng/J (1.0 lb/MWh) gross energy output.

(2) When burning liquid fuel exclusively or in combination with solid-derived fuel such that the liquid fuel contributes 50 percent or more of the total heat input to the combined cycle combustion turbine, the owner or operator shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain NO(expressed as NO) in excess of 190 ng/J (1.5 lb/MWh) gross energy output.

(3) In cases when during a 30-boiler operating day rolling average compliance period liquid fuel is burned in such a manner to meet the conditions in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for only a portion of the clock hours in the 30-day compliance period, the owner or operator shall not cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain NO(expressed as NO) in excess of the computed weighted-average emissions limit based on the proportion of gross energy output (in MWh) generated during the compliance period for each of emissions limits in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section.

(g) Except as provided in paragraphs (h) of this section and § 60.45Da, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification after May 3, 2011, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain NO(expressed as NO) in excess of the applicable emissions limit specified in paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) For an affected facility which commenced construction or reconstruction, any gases that contain NOin excess of either:

(i) 88 ng/J (0.70 lb/MWh) gross energy output; or

(ii) 95 ng/J (0.76 lb/MWh) net energy output.

(2) For an affected facility which commenced construction or reconstruction and that burns 75 percent or more coal refuse (by heat input) on a 12-month rolling average basis, any gases that contain NOin excess of either:

(i) 110 ng/J (0.85 lb/MWh) gross energy output; or

(ii) 120 ng/J (0.92 lb/MWh) net energy output.

(3) For an affected facility which commenced modification, any gases that contain NOin excess of 140 ng/J (1.1 lb/MWh) gross energy output.

(h) The NOemissions limits under this section do not apply to an owner or operator of an affected facility which is operating under a commercial demonstration permit issued by the Administrator in accordance with the provisions of § 60.47Da.
