############# § 60.42b Standard for sulfur dioxide (SO).

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), or (j) of this section, on and after the date on which the performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005, that combusts coal or oil shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain SOin excess of 87 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) or 10 percent (0.10) of the potential SOemission rate (90 percent reduction) and the emission limit determined according to the following formula:

For facilities complying with the percent reduction standard, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in this paragraph. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels or heat derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.

(b) On and after the date on which the performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005, that combusts coal refuse alone in a fluidized bed combustion steam generating unit shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain SOin excess of 87 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) or 20 percent (0.20) of the potential SOemission rate (80 percent reduction) and 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/MMBtu) heat input. If coal or oil is fired with coal refuse, the affected facility is subject to paragraph (a) or (d) of this section, as applicable. For facilities complying with the percent reduction standard, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in this paragraph. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels or heat derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.

(c) On and after the date on which the performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts coal or oil, either alone or in combination with any other fuel, and that uses an emerging technology for the control of SOemissions, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain SOin excess of 50 percent of the potential SOemission rate (50 percent reduction) and that contain SOin excess of the emission limit determined according to the following formula:

For facilities complying with the percent reduction standard, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in this paragraph. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels, or from the heat input derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.

(d) On and after the date on which the performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005 and listed in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), (3), or (4) of this section shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain SOin excess of 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts coal, or 215 ng/J (0.5 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts oil other than very low sulfur oil. Percent reduction requirements are not applicable to affected facilities under paragraphs (d)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this section. For facilities complying with paragraphs (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in this paragraph. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels or heat derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.

(1) Affected facilities that have an annual capacity factor for coal and oil of 30 percent (0.30) or less and are subject to a federally enforceable permit limiting the operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor for coal and oil of 30 percent (0.30) or less;

(2) Affected facilities located in a noncontinental area; or

(3) Affected facilities combusting coal or oil, alone or in combination with any fuel, in a duct burner as part of a combined cycle system where 30 percent (0.30) or less of the heat entering the steam generating unit is from combustion of coal and oil in the duct burner and 70 percent (0.70) or more of the heat entering the steam generating unit is from the exhaust gases entering the duct burner; or

(4) The affected facility burns coke oven gas alone or in combination with natural gas or very low sulfur distillate oil.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, compliance with the emission limits, fuel oil sulfur limits, and/or percent reduction requirements under this section are determined on a 30-day rolling average basis.

(f) Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, compliance with the emission limits or fuel oil sulfur limits under this section is determined on a 24-hour average basis for affected facilities that (1) have a federally enforceable permit limiting the annual capacity factor for oil to 10 percent or less, (2) combust only very low sulfur oil, and (3) do not combust any other fuel.

(g) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section and § 60.45b(a), the SOemission limits and percent reduction requirements under this section apply at all times, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction.

(h) Reductions in the potential SOemission rate through fuel pretreatment are not credited toward the percent reduction requirement under paragraph (c) of this section unless:

(1) Fuel pretreatment results in a 50 percent or greater reduction in potential SOemissions and

(2) Emissions from the pretreated fuel (without combustion or post-combustion SOcontrol) are equal to or less than the emission limits specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(i) An affected facility subject to paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section may combust very low sulfur oil or natural gas when the SOcontrol system is not being operated because of malfunction or maintenance of the SOcontrol system.

(j) Percent reduction requirements are not applicable to affected facilities combusting only very low sulfur oil. The owner or operator of an affected facility combusting very low sulfur oil shall demonstrate that the oil meets the definition of very low sulfur oil by: (1) Following the performance testing procedures as described in § 60.45b(c) or § 60.45b(d), and following the monitoring procedures as described in § 60.47b(a) or § 60.47b(b) to determine SOemission rate or fuel oil sulfur content; or (2) maintaining fuel records as described in § 60.49b(r).

(k)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (k)(2), (k)(3), and (k)(4) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commences construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005, and that combusts coal, oil, natural gas, a mixture of these fuels, or a mixture of these fuels with any other fuels shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that contain SOin excess of 87 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input or 8 percent (0.08) of the potential SOemission rate (92 percent reduction) and 520 ng/J (1.2 lb/MMBtu) heat input. For facilities complying with the percent reduction standard and paragraph (k)(3) of this section, only the heat input supplied to the affected facility from the combustion of coal and oil is counted in paragraph (k) of this section. No credit is provided for the heat input to the affected facility from the combustion of natural gas, wood, municipal-type solid waste, or other fuels or heat derived from exhaust gases from other sources, such as gas turbines, internal combustion engines, kilns, etc.

(2) Units firing only very low sulfur oil, gaseous fuel, a mixture of these fuels, or a mixture of these fuels with any other fuels with a potential SOemission rate of 140 ng/J (0.32 lb/MMBtu) heat input or less are exempt from the SOemissions limit in paragraph (k)(1) of this section.
