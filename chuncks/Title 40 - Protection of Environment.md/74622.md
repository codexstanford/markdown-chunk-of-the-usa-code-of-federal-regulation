###### § 430.27 Pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and must achieve the following pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).

(a)(1) The following pretreatment standards apply with respect to each fiber line that is a new source, unless the indirect discharger discloses to the pretreatment control authority in a report submitted under 40 CFR 403.12 that it uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes at that fiber line:

(2) The following pretreatment standards apply with respect to each new source fiber line operated by an indirect discharger subject to this section if the indirect discharger discloses to the pretreatment control authority in a report submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), or (e) that it uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes at that fiber line:

(b) The following pretreatment standards apply to all new source indirect dischargers, regardless of when they commenced discharge, in accordance with the previous subcategorization scheme. An indirect discharger is not required to meet these pretreatment standards if it certifies to the pretreatment control authority that it is not using these compounds as biocides. In cases when POTWs find it necessary to impose mass-based effluent limitations, equivalent mass limitations are provided as guidance:

(c) An indirect discharger must demonstrate compliance with the pretreatment standards in paragraph (a)(1) of this section by monitoring at the point where the wastewater containing those pollutants leaves the bleach plant.
