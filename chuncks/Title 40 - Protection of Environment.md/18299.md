###### § 60.142a Standards for particulate matter.

(a) Except as provided under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, on and after the date on which the performance test under § 60.8 is required to be completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any affected facility any secondary emissions that:

(1) Exit from the BOPF shop roof monitor (or other building openings) and exhibit greater than 10 percent opacity during the steel production cycle of any top-blown BOPF or during hot metal transfer or skimming operations for any bottom-blown BOPF; except that an opacity greater than 10 percent but less than 20 percent may occur once per steel production cycle.

(2) Exit from a control device used solely for the collection of secondary emissions from a top-blown BOPF or from hot metal transfer or skimming for a top-blown or a bottom-blown BOPF and contain particulate matter in excess of 23 mg/dscm (0.010 gr/dscf).

(3) Exit from a control device used solely for the collection of secondary emissions from a top-blown BOPF or from hot metal transfer or skimming for a top-blown or a bottom-blown BOPF and exhibit more than 5 percent opacity.

(b) A fume suppression system used to control secondary emissions from an affected facility is not subject to paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section.

(c) A control device used to collect both primary and secondary emissions from a BOPF is not subject to paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section.
