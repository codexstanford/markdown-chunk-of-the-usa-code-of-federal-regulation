###### § 264.96 Compliance period.

(a) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit the compliance period during which the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 applies. The compliance period is the number of years equal to the active life of the waste management area (including any waste management activity prior to permitting, and the closure period.)

(b) The compliance period begins when the owner or operator initiates a compliance monitoring program meeting the requirements of § 264.99.

(c) If the owner or operator is engaged in a corrective action program at the end of the compliance period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the compliance period is extended until the owner or operator can demonstrate that the ground-water protection standard of § 264.92 has not been exceeded for a period of three consecutive years.
