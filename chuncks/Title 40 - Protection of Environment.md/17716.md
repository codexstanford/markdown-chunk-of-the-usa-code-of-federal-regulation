(iv) Construction of the affected facility commenced after June 19, 1984, and before November 25, 1986.

(4) An affected facility burning coke oven gas alone or in combination with other fuels not subject to a PM standard under § 60.43b and not using a post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) for reducing PM or SOemissions is not subject to the PM limits under § 60.43b(a).

(b) On and after the date on which the performance test is completed or required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005, and that combusts oil (or mixtures of oil with other fuels) and uses a conventional or emerging technology to reduce SOemissions shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/MMBtu) heat input.

(c) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification on or before February 28, 2005, and that combusts wood, or wood with other fuels, except coal, shall cause to be discharged from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of the following emission limits:

(1) 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility has an annual capacity factor greater than 30 percent (0.30) for wood.

(2) 86 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input if (i) The affected facility has an annual capacity factor of 30 percent (0.30) or less for wood;

(ii) Is subject to a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 30 percent (0.30) or less for wood; and

(iii) Has a maximum heat input capacity of 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less.

(d) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts municipal-type solid waste or mixtures of municipal-type solid waste with other fuels, shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of the following emission limits:

(1) 43 ng/J (0.10 lb/MMBtu) heat input;

(i) If the affected facility combusts only municipal-type solid waste; or

(ii) If the affected facility combusts municipal-type solid waste and other fuels and has an annual capacity factor for the other fuels of 10 percent (0.10) or less.

(2) 86 ng/J (0.20 lb/MMBtu) heat input if the affected facility combusts municipal-type solid waste or municipal-type solid waste and other fuels; and

(i) Has an annual capacity factor for municipal-type solid waste and other fuels of 30 percent (0.30) or less;

(ii) Has a maximum heat input capacity of 73 MW (250 MMBtu/hr) or less;

(iii) Has a federally enforceable requirement limiting operation of the affected facility to an annual capacity factor of 30 percent (0.30) or less for municipal-type solid waste, or municipal-type solid waste and other fuels; and

(iv) Construction of the affected facility commenced after June 19, 1984, but on or before November 25, 1986.

(e) For the purposes of this section, the annual capacity factor is determined by dividing the actual heat input to the steam generating unit during the calendar year from the combustion of coal, wood, or municipal-type solid waste, and other fuels, as applicable, by the potential heat input to the steam generating unit if the steam generating unit had been operated for 8,760 hours at the maximum heat input capacity.

(f) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that combusts coal, oil, wood, or mixtures of these fuels with any other fuels shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere any gases that exhibit greater than 20 percent opacity (6-minute average), except for one 6-minute period per hour of not more than 27 percent opacity. An owner or operator of an affected facility that elects to install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) for measuring PM emissions according to the requirements of this subpart and is subject to a federally enforceable PM limit of 0.030 lb/MMBtu or less is exempt from the opacity standard specified in this paragraph.

(g) The PM and opacity standards apply at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction.

(h)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(2), (h)(3), (h)(4), (h)(5), and (h)(6) of this section, on and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, no owner or operator of an affected facility that commenced construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005, and that combusts coal, oil, wood, a mixture of these fuels, or a mixture of these fuels with any other fuels shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from that affected facility any gases that contain PM in excess of 13 ng/J (0.030 lb/MMBtu) heat input,

(5) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, an owner or operator of an affected facility not located in a noncontinental area that commences construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005, and that combusts only oil that contains no more than 0.30 weight percent sulfur, coke oven gas, a mixture of these fuels, or either fuel (or a mixture of these fuels) in combination with other fuels not subject to a PM standard in § 60.43b and not using a post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) to reduce SOor PM emissions is not subject to the PM limits in (h)(1) of this section.

(6) On and after the date on which the initial performance test is completed or is required to be completed under § 60.8, whichever date comes first, an owner or operator of an affected facility located in a noncontinental area that commences construction, reconstruction, or modification after February 28, 2005, and that combusts only oil that contains no more than 0.5 weight percent sulfur, coke oven gas, a mixture of these fuels, or either fuel (or a mixture of these fuels) in combination with other fuels not subject to a PM standard in § 60.43b and not using a post-combustion technology (except a wet scrubber) to reduce SOor PM emissions is not subject to the PM limits in (h)(1) of this section.
