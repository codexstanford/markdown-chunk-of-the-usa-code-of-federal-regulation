###### § 209.25 Accelerated decision; dismissal.

(a) The administrative law judge, upon motion of any party or sua sponte, may at any time render an accelerated decision in favor of the Agency or the respondent as to all or any part of the proceeding, without further hearing or upon such limited additional evidence such as affidavits as he or she may require, or dismiss any party with prejudice, under any of the following conditions:

(1) Failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or direct or collateral estoppel;

(2) No genuine issue of material fact exists and a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, as to all or any part of a proceeding; or

(3) Such other reasons as are just, including failure to obey a procedural order of the administrative law judge.

(b) If under this section an accelerated decision is issued as to all the issues and claims joined in the proceedings, the decision shall be treated as the decision of the administrative law judge as provided in § 209.30.

(c) If under this section, judgment is rendered on less than all issues or claims in the proceeding, the administrative law judge shall determine what material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good faith controverted. The administrative law judge shall thereupon issue an order specifying the facts which appear without substantial controversy, and the issues and claims upon which the hearing will proceed.
