###### Emission Limitations
####### § 63.3490 What emission limits must I meet?

(a) For a new or reconstructed affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to no more than the emission limit(s) in Table 1 to this subpart that apply to you during each 12-month compliance period, determined according to the requirements in § 63.3521, § 63.3531, or § 63.3541; or if you control emissions with an emissions control system using the control efficiency/outlet concentration option as specified in § 63.3491(d), you must reduce organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to no more than the limit(s) in Table 3 to this subpart, determined according to the requirements of § 63.3551. If you perform surface coating in more than one subcategory or utilize more than one coating type within a subcategory, then you must meet the individual emission limit(s) for each subcategory and coating type included.

(b) For an existing affected source, you must limit organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to no more than the emission limit(s) in Table 2 to this subpart that apply to you during each 12-month compliance period, determined according to the requirements in § 63.3521, § 63.3531, or § 63.3541; or if you control emissions with an emissions control system using the control efficiency/outlet concentration option as specified in § 63.3491(d), you must reduce organic HAP emissions to the atmosphere to no more than the limit(s) in Table 3 to this subpart, determined according to the requirements of § 63.3551. If you perform surface coating in more than one subcategory or utilize more than one coating type within a subcategory, then you must meet the individual emission limit(s) for each subcategory and coating type included.

(c) If you perform surface coating in different subcategories as described in § 63.3481(a)(1) through (4), then the coating operations in each subcategory constitute a separate affected source, and you must conduct separate compliance demonstrations for each applicable subcategory and coating type emission limit in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and reflect those separate determinations in notifications, reports, and records required by §§ 63.3510, 63.3511, and 63.3512, respectively.
