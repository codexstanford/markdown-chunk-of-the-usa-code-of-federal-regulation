(b)The Administrator will deduct CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances available under paragraph (a) of this section for compliance with the CSAPR SOGroup 1 assurance provisions for a State for a control period in a given year in accordance with the following procedures:

(1) By June 1 of each year from 2018 through 2021 and August 1 of each year thereafter, the Administrator will:

(i) Calculate, for each State (and Indian country within the borders of such State), the total SOemissions from all CSAPR SOGroup 1 units at CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources in the State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) during the control period in the year before the year of this calculation deadline and the amount, if any, by which such total SOemissions exceed the State assurance level as described in § 97.606(c)(2)(iii); and

(ii) For the set of any States (and Indian country within the borders of such States) for which the results of the calculations required in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section indicate that total SOemissions exceed the respective State assurance levels for such control period-

(A) Calculate, for each such State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) and such control period and each common designated representative for such control period for a group of one or more CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources and units in such State (and such Indian country), the common designated representative's share of the total SOemissions from all CSAPR SOGroup 1 units at CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources in such State (and such Indian country), the common designated representative's assurance level, and the amount (if any) of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances that the owners and operators of such group of sources and units must hold in accordance with the calculation formula in § 97.606(c)(2)(i); and

(B) Promulgate a notice of data availability of the results of the calculations required in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, including separate calculations of the SOemissions from each CSAPR SOGroup 1 source in each such State (and Indian country within the borders of such State).

(2) The Administrator will provide an opportunity for submission of objections to the calculations referenced by each notice of data availability required in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(i) Objections shall be submitted by the deadline specified in such notice and shall be limited to addressing whether the calculations referenced in such notice are in accordance with § 97.606(c)(2)(iii), §§ 97.606(b) and 97.630 through 97.635, the definitions of "common designated representative", "common designated representative's assurance level", and "common designated representative's share" in § 97.602, and the calculation formula in § 97.606(c)(2)(i).

(ii) The Administrator will adjust the calculations to the extent necessary to ensure that they are in accordance with the provisions referenced in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. By October 1 immediately after the promulgation of such notice, the Administrator will promulgate a notice of data availability of the results of the calculations incorporating any adjustments that the Administrator determines to be necessary and the reasons for accepting or rejecting any objections submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

(3) For any State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) referenced in each notice of data availability required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section as having CSAPR SOGroup 1 units with total SOemissions exceeding the State assurance level for a control period in a given year, the Administrator will establish one assurance account for each set of owners and operators referenced, in the notice of data availability required under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, as all of the owners and operators of a group of CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources and units in the State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) having a common designated representative for such control period and as being required to hold CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances.

(4)(i) As of midnight of November 1 immediately after the promulgation of each notice of data availability required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the owners and operators described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall hold in the assurance account established for them and for the appropriate CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources, CSAPR SOGroup 1 units, and State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) under paragraph (b)(3) of this section a total amount of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances, available for deduction under paragraph (a) of this section, equal to the amount such owners and operators are required to hold with regard to such sources, units and State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) as calculated by the Administrator and referenced in such notice.

(ii) Notwithstanding the allowance-holding deadline specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, if November 1 is not a business day, then such allowance-holding deadline shall be midnight of the first business day thereafter.

(5) After November 1 (or the date described in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section) immediately after the promulgation of each notice of data availability required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section and after the recordation, in accordance with § 97.623, of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowance transfers submitted by midnight of such date, the Administrator will determine whether the owners and operators described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section hold, in the assurance account for the appropriate CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources, CSAPR SOGroup 1 units, and State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) established under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the amount of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances available under paragraph (a) of this section that the owners and operators are required to hold with regard to such sources, units, and State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) as calculated by the Administrator and referenced in the notice required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart and any revision, made by or submitted to the Administrator after the promulgation of the notice of data availability required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for a control period in a given year, of any data used in making the calculations referenced in such notice, the amounts of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances that the owners and operators are required to hold in accordance with § 97.606(c)(2)(i) for such control period shall continue to be such amounts as calculated by the Administrator and referenced in such notice required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, except as follows:

(i) If any such data are revised by the Administrator as a result of a decision in or settlement of litigation concerning such data on appeal under part 78 of this chapter of such notice, or on appeal under section 307 of the Clean Air Act of a decision rendered under part 78 of this chapter on appeal of such notice, then the Administrator will use the data as so revised to recalculate the amounts of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances that owners and operators are required to hold in accordance with the calculation formula in § 97.606(c)(2)(i) for such control period with regard to the CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources, CSAPR SOGroup 1 units, and State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) involved, provided that such litigation under part 78 of this chapter, or the proceeding under part 78 of this chapter that resulted in the decision appealed in such litigation under section 307 of the Clean Air Act, was initiated no later than 30 days after promulgation of such notice required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

(ii) [Reserved]

(iii) If the revised data are used to recalculate, in accordance with paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the amount of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances that the owners and operators are required to hold for such control period with regard to the CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources, CSAPR SOGroup 1 units, and State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) involved-

(A) Where the amount of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances that the owners and operators are required to hold increases as a result of the use of all such revised data, the Administrator will establish a new, reasonable deadline on which the owners and operators shall hold the additional amount of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances in the assurance account established by the Administrator for the appropriate CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources, CSAPR SOGroup 1 units, and State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The owners' and operators' failure to hold such additional amount, as required, before the new deadline shall not be a violation of the Clean Air Act. The owners' and operators' failure to hold such additional amount, as required, as of the new deadline shall be a violation of the Clean Air Act. Each CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowance that the owners and operators fail to hold as required as of the new deadline, and each day in such control period, shall be a separate violation of the Clean Air Act.

(B) For the owners and operators for which the amount of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances required to be held decreases as a result of the use of all such revised data, the Administrator will record, in all accounts from which CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances were transferred by such owners and operators for such control period to the assurance account established by the Administrator for the appropriate CSAPR SOGroup 1 sources, CSAPR SOGroup 1 units, and State (and Indian country within the borders of such State) under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a total amount of the CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances held in such assurance account equal to the amount of the decrease. If CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances were transferred to such assurance account from more than one account, the amount of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances recorded in each such transferor account will be in proportion to the percentage of the total amount of CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowances transferred to such assurance account for such control period from such transferor account.

(C) Each CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowance held under paragraph (b)(6)(iii)(A) of this section as a result of recalculation of requirements under the CSAPR SOGroup 1 assurance provisions for such control period must be a CSAPR SOGroup 1 allowance allocated for a control period in a year before or the year immediately following, or in the same year as, the year of such control period.
