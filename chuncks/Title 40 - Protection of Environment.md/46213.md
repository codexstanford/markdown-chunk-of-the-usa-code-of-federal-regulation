####### VVT slow response.

(B)The OBD system must detect a malfunction prior to any failure or deterioration in the capability of the VVT system to achieve the commanded valve timing and/or control within a manufacturer-specified time that would cause an engine's emissions to exceed the emission thresholds for "other monitors" as shown in Table 2 of this paragraph (h).

(C) For engines in which no failure or deterioration of the VVT system could result in an engine's emissions exceeding the applicable emissions thresholds of paragraphs (h)(9)(ii)(A) and (h)(9)(ii)(B) of this section, the OBD system must detect a malfunction of the VVT system when proper functional response of the system to computer commands does not occur.
