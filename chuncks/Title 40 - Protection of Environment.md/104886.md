####### § 1090.1510 E15 labeling provisions.

Any retailer or WPC dispensing E15 must apply a label to the fuel dispenser as follows:

(a) Position the label to clearly identify which control the consumer will use to select E15. If the dispenser is set up to dispense E15 without the consumer taking action to select the fuel, position the label on a vertical surface in a prominent place, approximately at eye level.

(b) Figure 1 of this paragraph shows the required content and formatting. Use black letters on an orange background for the lower portion and the diagonal "Attention" field and use orange letters on a black background for the rest of the upper portion. Font size is shown in Figure 1. Set vertical position and line spacing as appropriate for each field. Dimensions are nominal values.
