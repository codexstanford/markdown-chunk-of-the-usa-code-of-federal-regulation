(ii) "Until this notice of delegation is superseded by another notice of delegation under 40 CFR 97.215(d), I agree to maintain an e-mail account and to notify the Administrator immediately of any change in my e-mail address unless all delegation of authority by me under 40 CFR 97.215 is terminated.".
