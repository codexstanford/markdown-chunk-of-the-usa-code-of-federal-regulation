#### PART 70 - STATE OPERATING PERMIT PROGRAMS
##### § 70.13 Documents that may be considered in reviewing petitions.

The information that the Administrator considers in making a determination whether to grant or deny a petition submitted under § 70.8(d) of this part on a proposed permit generally includes the petition itself, including attachments to the petition, and the administrative record for the proposed permit. For purposes of this paragraph, the administrative record for a particular proposed permit includes the draft and proposed permits; any permit applications that relate to the draft or proposed permits; the statement required by § 70.7(a)(5) (sometimes referred to as the `statement of basis'); any comments the permitting authority received during the public participation process on the draft permit; the permitting authority's written responses to comments, including responses to all significant comments raised during the public participation process on the draft permit; and all materials available to the permitting authority that are relevant to the permitting decision and that the permitting authority made available to the public according to § 70.7(h)(2) of this part. If a final permit is available during the agency's review of a petition on a proposed permit, that document may also be considered as part of making a determination whether to grant or deny the petition.
