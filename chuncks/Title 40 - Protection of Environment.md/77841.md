(1) For initial general label values, no later than five working days before the date that the model type is initially offered for sale;

(2) For specific label values, no later than five working days before any vehicles are offered for sale;

(3) For model types having label values updated because of running changes (as required under § 600.314(b)), the submission must be made at least five working days before the date of implementation of the running change.

(b) A manufacturer may not proceed with any label calculation until the data from each vehicle used in such calculation satisfies the requirements of § 600.008, except as allowed under the provisions of § 600.314-01(e) and approved by the Administrator.

(c) If the Administrator has waived any testing in paragraph (b) of this section and subsequently finds that the decision to waive testing was based on an incorrect data submission or that a fuel economy offset exists (based on subsequent testing of that manufacturer's product line), the Administrator may require confirmation of the data generated by any such waived vehicle.
