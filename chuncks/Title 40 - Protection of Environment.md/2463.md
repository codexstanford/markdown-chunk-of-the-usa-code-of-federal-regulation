####### § 35.4005 What is a Technical Assistance Grant?

A Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) provides money for your group to obtain technical assistance in interpreting information with regard to a Superfund site. EPA awards TAGs to promote public participation in decision making at eligible sites. A TAG allows your group to procure independent technical advisors to help you interpret and comment on site-related information and decisions. Examples of how a technical advisor can help your group include, but are not limited to:

(a) Reviewing preliminary site assessment/site investigation data;

(b) Participating in public meetings to help interpret information about site conditions, proposed remedies, and the implementation of a remedy;

(c) Visiting the site vicinity periodically during cleanup, if possible, to observe progress and provide technical updates to your group; and

(d) Evaluate future land use options based on land use assumptions found in the "remedial investigation/feasibility study."
