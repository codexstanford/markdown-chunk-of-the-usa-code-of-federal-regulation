() The percent reduction shall be measured according to the procedures in § 63.116 of this subpart if a combustion control device is used. For a flare meeting the criteria in § 63.116(a) of this subpart, or a boiler or process heater meeting the criteria in § 63.116(b) of this subpart, the percent reduction shall be 98 percent. If a non-combustion control device is used, percent reduction shall be demonstrated by a performance test at the inlet and outlet of the device, or, if testing is not feasible, by a control design evaluation and documented engineering calculations.
