###### § 610.50 Test configurations.

(a) In addition to the tuneup to manufacturer's specifications per § 610.41, all vehicles in the durability fleet will have installed the following new parts: Air, oil, and fuel filters, spark plugs, points, condenser, rotor, distributor cap, PCV valve, and emission control devices such as vacuum control valves and EGR valves.

(b) Vehicles included in the durability fleet will be subjected at zero device-miles to the same test sequence for fuel economy and exhaust emissions as specified in subpart D. Subsequently, they will be tested at 3,000 device-mile intervals, up to and including the final mileage point of 15,000 device-miles. Testing at these mileage points will be performed with the vehicle equipped with the full retrofit system.

(c) After the 15,000-mile test the vehicle will be tuned as necessary and the device adjusted to the manufacturer's specifications as required. The fully restored retrofitted configuration will then be tested. The device will then be removed from the vehicle and the vehicle set to vehicle manufacturer's specifications. A tuned baseline test will then be conducted.
