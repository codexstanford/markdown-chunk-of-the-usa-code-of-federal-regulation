(ii) Records of annual afterburner inspections.

(3) For each scrap dryer/delacquering kiln/decoating kiln and group 1 furnace, subject to D/F and HCl emission standards with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter, records of 15-minute block average inlet temperatures for each lime-injected fabric filter, including any period when the 3-hour block average temperature exceeds the compliant operating parameter value +14 &#xB0;C (+ 25 &#xB0;F), with a brief explanation of the cause of the excursion and the corrective action taken.

(4) For each affected source and emission unit with emissions controlled by a lime-injected fabric filter:

(i) Records of inspections at least once every 8-hour period verifying that lime is present in the feeder hopper or silo and flowing, including any inspection where blockage is found, with a brief explanation of the cause of the blockage and the corrective action taken, and records of inspections at least once every 4-hour period for the subsequent 3 days. If flow monitors, pressure drop sensors or load cells are used to verify that lime is present in the hopper and flowing, records of all monitor or sensor output including any event where blockage was found, with a brief explanation of the cause of the blockage and the corrective action taken;

(ii) If lime feeder setting is monitored, records of daily and monthly inspections of feeder setting, including records of any deviation of the feeder setting from the setting used in the performance test, with a brief explanation of the cause of the deviation and the corrective action taken. If a lime feeder has been repaired or replaced, this action must be documented along with records of the new feeder calibration and the feed mechanism set points necessary to maintain the lb/hr feed rate operating limit. These records must be maintained on site and available upon request.

(iii) If lime addition rate for a noncontinuous lime injection system is monitored pursuant to the approved alternative monitoring requirements in § 63.1510(v), records of the time and mass of each lime addition during each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test and calculations of the average lime addition rate (lb/ton of feed/charge).

(5) For each group 1 furnace (with or without add-on air pollution control devices) or in-line fluxer, records of 15-minute block average weights of gaseous or liquid reactive flux injection, total reactive flux injection rate and calculations (including records of the identity, composition, and weight of each addition of gaseous, liquid or solid reactive flux), including records of any period the rate exceeds the compliant operating parameter value and corrective action taken.

(6) For each continuous monitoring system, records required by § 63.10(c).

(7) For each affected source and emission unit subject to an emission standard in kg/Mg (lb/ton) of feed/charge, records of feed/charge (or throughput) weights for each operating cycle or time period used in the performance test.

(8) Approved site-specific monitoring plan for a group 1 furnace without add-on air pollution control devices with records documenting conformance with the plan.

(9) Records of all charge materials for each thermal chip dryer, dross-only furnace, and group 1 melting/holding furnaces without air pollution control devices processing only clean charge.

(10) Operating logs for each group 1 sidewell furnace with add-on air pollution control devices documenting conformance with operating standards for maintaining the level of molten metal above the top of the passage between the sidewell and hearth during reactive flux injection and for adding reactive flux only to the sidewell or a furnace hearth equipped with a control device for PM, HCl, and D/F emissions.
