###### § 303.30 Criteria for payment of award.

Upon the filing of an eligible claim in accordance with the procedures as set forth in § 303.33, the Agency's Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Monitoring, or his Deputy for Criminal Enforcement, in making the decision to grant an award, and if so, in what amount, shall consider all relevant criteria, giving such weight and importance to each separate criterion as appears warranted in his judgment alone. Relevant criteria include one or more of the following:

(a) Whether the claimant's information constituted the initial, unsolicited notice to the Government of the violation;

(b) Whether the Government would readily have obtained knowledge of the violation in a timely manner absent claimant's information;

(c) Importance of the case, egregiousness of the violation, potential for or existence of environmental harm;

(d) Concealment of a person criminally culpable or existence of an organized criminal conspiracy to conceal the offense(s) committed by the named defendant(s);

(e) Willingness of the claimant to assist the Government's prosecution of the offense(s), which assistance includes providing further information and grand jury testimony, participating in trial preparation, and trial testimony if consistent with the limits on claimant identity disclosure as set forth in § 303.31.

(f) Value of the claimant's assistance in comparison to that given by all other sources of information and evidence which led to arrest and conviction.
