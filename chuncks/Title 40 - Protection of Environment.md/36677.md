###### Continuous Compliance Requirements
####### § 63.7330 What are my monitoring requirements?

(a) For each baghouse applied to pushing emissions from a coke oven battery, you must at all times monitor the relative change in particulate matter loadings using a bag leak detection system according to the requirements in § 63.7331(a) and conduct inspections at their specified frequency according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section.

(1) Monitor the pressure drop across each baghouse cell each day to ensure pressure drop is within the normal operating range identified in the manual;

(2) Confirm that dust is being removed from hoppers through weekly visual inspections or equivalent means of ensuring the proper functioning of removal mechanisms;

(3) Check the compressed air supply for pulse-jet baghouses each day;

(4) Monitor cleaning cycles to ensure proper operation using an appropriate methodology;

(5) Check bag cleaning mechanisms for proper functioning through monthly visual inspection or equivalent means;

(6) Make monthly visual checks of bag tension on reverse air and shaker-type baghouses to ensure that bags are not kinked (kneed or bent) or laying on their sides. You do not have to make this check for shaker-type baghouses using self-tensioning (spring-loaded) devices;

(7) Confirm the physical integrity of the baghouse through quarterly visual inspections of the baghouse interior for air leaks; and

(8) Inspect fans for wear, material buildup, and corrosion through quarterly visual inspections, vibration detectors, or equivalent means.

(b) For each venturi scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you must at all times monitor the pressure drop and water flow rate using a CPMS according to the requirements in § 63.7331(e).

(c) For each hot water scrubber applied to pushing emissions, you must at all times monitor the water pressure and temperature using a CPMS according to the requirements in § 63.7331(f).

(d) For each capture system applied to pushing emissions, you must at all times monitor the volumetric flow rate according to the requirements in § 63.7331(g), the fan motor amperes according to the requirements in § 63.7331(h), or the static pressure or the fan RPM according to the requirements in § 63.7331(i).

(e) For each by-product coke oven battery, you must monitor at all times the opacity of emissions exiting each stack using a COMS according to the requirements in § 63.7331(j).

(f) For each multicyclone applied to pushing emissions, you must monitor at all times the pressure drop using a CPMS according to the requirements in § 63.7331(k).
