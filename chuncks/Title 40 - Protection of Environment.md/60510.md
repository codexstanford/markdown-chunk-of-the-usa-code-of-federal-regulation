###### § 180.123a Inorganic bromide residues in peanut hay and peanut hulls; statement of policy.

(a) Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration show that peanut hay and peanut shells have been used as feed for meat and dairy animals. While many growers now harvest peanuts with combines and leave the hay on the ground to be incorporated into the soil, some growers follow the practice of curing peanuts on the vines in a stack and save the hay for animal feed. Peanut shells or hulls have been used to a minor extent as roughage for cattle feed. It has been established that the feeding to cattle of peanut hay and peanut hulls containing residues of inorganic bromides will contribute considerable residues of inorganic bromides to the meat and milk.

(b) There are no tolerances for inorganic bromides in meat and milk to cover residues from use of such peanut hulls as animal feed. Peanut hulls containing residues of inorganic bromides from the use of methyl bromide are unsuitable as an ingredient in the feed of meat and dairy animals and should not be represented, sold, or used for that purpose.
