###### Core Program Cooperative Agreements
####### § 35.6215 Eligibility for Core Program Cooperative Agreements.

(a) States and Indian Tribes may apply for Core Program Cooperative Agreements in order to conduct CERCLA implementation activities that are not directly assignable to specific sites, but are intended to develop and maintain a State's or Indian Tribe's ability to participate in the CERCLA response program.

(b) Only the State or Indian Tribal government agency designated as the single point of contact with EPA for CERCLA implementation is eligible to receive a Core Program Cooperative Agreement.

(c) When it is more economical for a government entity other than the recipient (such as a political subdivision or State Attorney General) to implement tasks funded through a Core Program Cooperative Agreement, benefits to such entities must be provided for in an intergovernmental agreement.
