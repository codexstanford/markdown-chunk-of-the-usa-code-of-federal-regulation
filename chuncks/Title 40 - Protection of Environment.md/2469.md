###### Who Is Eligible?
####### § 35.4025 Is there any way my group can get a TAG if it is currently ineligible?

You can make your group eligible by establishing an identity separate from that of the PRP or other ineligible entity by making a reasonable demonstration of independence from the ineligible entity. Such a demonstration requires, at a minimum, a showing that your group has a separate and distinct:

(a) Formal legal identity (for example, your group has different officers); and

(b) Substantive existence (meaning, is not affiliated with an ineligible entity), including its own finances.

(1) In determining whether your group has a different substantive existence from the ineligible entity, you must establish for us that your group:

(i) Is not controlled either directly or indirectly, by the ineligible entity; and

(ii) Does not control, either directly or indirectly, an ineligible entity.

(2) You must also establish for EPA that a third group does not have the power to control both your group and an ineligible entity.
