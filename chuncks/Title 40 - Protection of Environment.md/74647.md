###### § 430.56 Pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and must achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES).

(a) The following pretreatment standards must be attained on or before April 16, 2001.

(1) The following pretreatment standards apply to all indirect dischargers in the calcium-, magnesium-, or sodium-based sulfite pulp segment:

(2)(i) The following pretreatment standards apply to all indirect dischargers in the ammonium-based sulfite pulp segment:

(ii) The following pretreatment standards apply with respect to each new source fiber line operated by an indirect discharger producing ammonium-based sulfite pulps if the indirect discharger discloses to the pretreatment control authority in a report submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(b) that it uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes at that fiber line:

(3)(i) The following pretreatment standards apply to all indirect dischargers in the specialty grade sulfite pulp segment:

(ii) The following pretreatment standards apply with respect to each fiber line operated by an indirect discharger producing specialty grade sulfite pulps if the indirect discharger discloses to the pretreatment control authority in a report submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), or (e) that it uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes at that fiber line. These pretreatment standards must be attained on or before April 16, 2001:

(b) The following pretreatment standards apply to each indirect discharger, in accordance with the previous subcategorization scheme, unless it certifies to the pretreatment control authority that it is not using these compounds as biocides. In cases when POTWs find it necessary to impose mass effluent limitations, equivalent mass limitations are provided as guidance:

(c) An indirect discharger must demonstrate compliance with the pretreatment standards in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, as applicable, by monitoring for all pollutants at the point where the wastewater containing those pollutants leaves the bleach plant.
