###### § 307.22 Preauthorization of response actions.

(a) No person may submit a claim to the Fund for a response action unless that person notifies the Administrator of EPA or his designee prior to taking such response action and receives preauthorization by EPA. In order to obtain preauthorization, any person intending to submit a claim to the Fund must fulfill the following requirements before commencing a response action:

(1) Notify the lead agency through the National Response Center (as described in 40 CFR 300.125), if there is acute threat of fire, explosion, or direct human contact with hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants or other emergency situation, to determine if there is sufficient time to submit an application for preauthorization;

(2) Submit an application for preauthorization (EPA Form 2075-3, found at appendix A of this part) to the Administrator or his designee; and

(3) Obtain the approval of the Administrator or his designee before initiating the response action.

(b) All applications for preauthorization must include, where available;

(1) A description of the location and nature of the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant (e.g., type and location of vessel or facility, population at risk, routes of exposure);

(2) A description of the nature and quantity of the hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant which has been or may be released, including whether the substance is on the list of hazardous substances set forth pursuant to section 102 of CERCLA;

(3) The identity of any potentially responsible parties known to the applicant (including the applicant), and any contact with such parties, including, but not limited to, any correspondence, agreements, or litigation with such parties;

(4) Evidence of the applicant's eligibility to file a claim pursuant to § 307.20;

(6) A description of the applicant's capability (including financial and technical capability) to implement the proposed response action;

(10) The proposed contracting procedures;

(11) Proposed procedures for project management, EPA oversight, and reporting of progress of the project; and

(12) The assurances of timely initiation and completion.

(c) Applications for preauthorization to undertake a removal action shall, in addition to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, include:

(1) A summary or copy of the preliminary assessment; and

(2) A description of the proposed removal action for which the claim will be made, which environmental requirements are applicable or relevant and appropriate, and how the removal will comply with such requirements.

(d) Applications for preauthorization to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study shall, in addition to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, include:

(1) The scope of the proposed study;

(2) A proposed site sampling plan and quality assurance procedures;

(3) The plan for the development of alternatives;

(4) Approaches to consideration of alternatives to land disposal;

(5) Plans for initial screening of alternatives;

(6) Proposed procedures for the detailed analysis of alternatives; and

(7) Proposed considerations in selection of the remedy.

(e) Applications for preauthorization to undertake a remedial alternative other than that selected by EPA, or where EPA has not selected a remedy, shall, in addition to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, include a discussion of how the proposed remedy:

(1) Differs from the one selected by EPA, if applicable;

(2) Achieves protection of public health and welfare and the environment and complies with legally applicable or otherwise relevant and appropriate Federal, State, and local requirements pursuant to 40 CFR 300.400(g) or waivers to those requirements in 40 CFR 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(C). The application shall also include a discussion of pertinent Federal and State guidance, advisories, and criteria;

(3) Will be cost-effective as set out in section 121(a) of CERCLA and 40 CFR 300.430(f)(1)(ii)(D);

(1) A description of the proposed remedial action for which the claim will be made;

(2) A proposed site sampling plan and quality assurance procedures;

(3) Documentation of reasonable effort to obtain the cooperation of the State or Indian Tribe;

(4) A bond or other financial assurance to cover the costs of necessary long-term operation and maintenance of the response action or written assurance from the State to provide such long-term operation and maintenance;

(5) Proposed procedures using sealed bidding to select the construction contractor, or an explanation of why the applicant intends to use any other method; and

(6) Documentation showing that the response will be carried out in accordance with applicable or relevant and appropriate environmental requirements. Documentation should include the potential impacts on any environmentally sensitive areas.

(g) Claims of business confidentiality may be asserted for information submitted to EPA under this subpart. Information claimed confidential will be disclosed by EPA only to the extent permitted by CERCLA, this subpart, and part 2, subpart B, of this chapter.

(1) Any claim of business confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Claims must be asserted as prescribed on the forms. Items claimed confidential on the forms and attachments to the forms must be clearly marked by circling or bracketing them.

(2) The applicant or response claimant must provide EPA with two copies of its submittal if any information is claimed confidential.

(i) One copy of the submittal must be complete, with items claimed confidential clearly marked in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

(ii) The second copy must be complete except that all information claimed as confidential in the first copy must be deleted. EPA may make this second copy available to the public.

(iii) If the applicant does not provide a redacted copy, the application for preauthorization is incomplete. If the claimant does not provide a redacted copy, the claim against the Fund will not be perfected by EPA. EPA will not process such submittals until it receives the redacted copy.

(3) If a submitter of a response claim or an application for preauthorization does not assert a claim of business confidentiality for information at the time the information is submitted to EPA, the Agency may make the information public without further notice to the submitter.

(h) In addition to the foregoing, an application for preauthorization filed by a potentially responsible party for partial reimbursement of response costs shall include:

(1) A copy of the settlement agreement, or the most recent draft of any pending agreement, reached between such parties and the Federal Government; and

(2) If the application is to undertake a remedial investigation and feasibility study, an affirmation that the applicant will not directly or indirectly benefit from the preauthorization as a response action contractor, or as a person hired or retained by such a contractor with respect to the site at issue and an agreement to reimburse the Fund for any costs incurred under, or in connection with, the oversight contract or arrangement for the remedial investigation and feasibility study.

(i) If it is subsequently determined that the preauthorized response actions require modification or if it appears that project costs will exceed approved costs, a revised application for preauthorization must be approved by EPA before different, or additional, actions can be undertaken, if such actions are to be eligible for compensation from the Fund.

(j) Unless otherwise specified and agreed to by EPA, the terms, provisions, or requirements of a court judgment, Consent Decree, administrative order (whether unilateral or on consent), or any other consensual agreement with EPA requiring a response action do not constitute preauthorization to present a claim to the Fund.
