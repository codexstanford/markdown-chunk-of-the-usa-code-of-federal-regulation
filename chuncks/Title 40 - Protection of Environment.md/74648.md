###### § 430.57 Pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must: comply with 40 CFR part 403; and achieve the following pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS).

(a) (1) The following pretreatment standards apply to each indirect discharger in the calcium-,

(2)(i) The following standards apply to each indirect discharger in the ammonium-based sulfite pulp segment that is a new source:

(ii) The following pretreatment standards apply with respect to each new source fiber line operated by an indirect discharger producing ammonium-based sulfite pulps if the indirect discharger discloses to the pretreatment control authority in a report submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), or (e) that it uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes at that fiber line:

(3)(i) The following pretreatment standards apply to each indirect discharger in the specialty grade sulfite pulp segment that is a new source:

(ii) The following pretreatment standards apply with respect to each new source fiber line operated by an indirect discharger producing specialty grade sulfite pulps if the indirect discharger discloses to the pretreatment control authority in a report submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), or (e) that it uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes at that fiber line:

(b) The following pretreatment standards shall apply to each new source indirect dischargers unless the indirect discharger certifies to the pretreatment control authority that it is not using these compounds as biocides. In cases when POTWs find it necessary to impose mass effluent standards, equivalent mass standards are provided as guidance:
