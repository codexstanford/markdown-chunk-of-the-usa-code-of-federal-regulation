###### § 63.1655 Maintenance requirements.

(a) The owner or operator of an affected source must comply with the requirements of § 63.6(e) of subpart A.

(b)(1) The owner or operator must develop and implement a written maintenance plan for each air pollution control device associated with submerged arc furnaces, metal oxygen refining processes, and crushing and screening operations subject to the provisions of this part. The owner or operator must keep the maintenance plan on record and available for the Administrator's inspection for the life of the air pollution control device or until the affected source is no longer subject to the provisions of this part.

(2) To satisfy the requirement to develop maintenance plans, the owner or operator may use the affected source's standard operating procedures (SOP) manual or other plan, provided the alternative plan meets the requirements of this paragraph and is made available for inspection when requested by the Administrator.

(c) The procedures specified in the maintenance plan must include a preventive maintenance schedule that is consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions and, for baghouses, ensure that the requirements specified in § 63.1657(a) are met.

(d) The owner or operator must perform monthly inspections of the equipment that is important to the performance of the furnace capture system. This inspection must include an examination of the physical condition of the equipment, suitable for detecting holes in ductwork or hoods, flow constrictions in ductwork due to dents or accumulated dust, and operational status of flow rate controllers (pressure sensors, dampers, damper switches, etc.). Any deficiencies must be recorded and proper maintenance and repairs performed.
