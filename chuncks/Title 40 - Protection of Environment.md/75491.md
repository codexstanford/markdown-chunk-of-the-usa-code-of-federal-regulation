Except as provided in subpart L of this part and 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(b) The concentration of pollutants discharged in mine drainage from mines producing less than 5000 metric tons (5512 short tons) or discharged from mills processing less than 5000 metric tons (5512 short tons) of tungsten ores per year by methods other than ore leaching shall not exceed:

(c) The concentration of pollutants discharged from mills processing 5000 metric tons (5512 short tons) or more of tungsten ores per year by purely physical methods including ore crushing, washing, jigging, heavy media separation, and magnetic and electrostatic separation shall not exceed:
