####### § 63.5737 How do I demonstrate compliance with the resin and gel coat application equipment cleaning standards?

(a) Determine and record the organic HAP content of the cleaning solvents subject to the standards specified in § 63.5734 using the methods specified in § 63.5758.

(b) If you recycle cleaning solvents on site, you may use documentation from the solvent manufacturer or supplier or a measurement of the organic HAP content of the cleaning solvent as originally obtained from the solvent supplier for demonstrating compliance, subject to the conditions in § 63.5758 for demonstrating compliance with organic HAP content limits.

(c) At least once per month, you must visually inspect any containers holding organic HAP-containing solvents used for removing cured resin and gel coat to ensure that the containers have covers with no visible gaps. Keep records of the monthly inspections and any repairs made to the covers.
