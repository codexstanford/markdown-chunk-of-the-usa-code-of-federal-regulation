###### § 63.1313 Emission standards.

(a) Except as allowed under paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the owner or operator of an existing or new affected source shall comply with the provisions in:

(1) Section 63.1314 for storage vessels;

(2) Section 63.1315, or §§ 63.1316 through 63.1320, as appropriate, for continuous process vents;

(3) Section 63.1321 for batch process vents;

(4) Section 63.1328 for heat exchange systems;

(5) Section 63.1329 for process contact cooling towers;

(6) Section 63.1330 for wastewater;

(7) Section 63.1331 for equipment leaks;

(8) Section 63.1333 for additional test methods and procedures;

(9) Section 63.1334 for parameter monitoring levels and excursions; and

(10) Section 63.1335 for general recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

(b) When emissions of different kinds (i.e., emissions from continuous process vents subject to either § 63.1315 or §§ 63.1316 through 63.1320, batch process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, storage vessels, process wastewater, and/or in-process equipment subject to § 63.149) are combined, and at least one of the emission streams would be classified as Group 1 in the absence of combination with other emission streams, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate. For purposes of this paragraph (b), combined emission streams containing one or more batch process vents and containing one or more continuous process vents subject to § 63.1315, § 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), § 63.1316(b)(1)(ii), § 63.1316(b)(2)(i), § 63.1316(b)(2)(ii), or § 63.1316(c)(1), excluding § 63.1316(c)(1)(ii), may comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate. For purposes of this paragraph (b), the owner or operator of an affected source with combined emission streams containing one or more batch process vents but not containing one or more continuous process vents subject to § 63.1315, § 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), § 63.1316(b)(1)(ii), § 63.1316(b)(2)(i), § 63.1316(b)(2)(ii), or § 63.1316(c)(1), excluding § 63.1316(c)(1)(ii), shall comply with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(1) Comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart for each kind of emission in the stream as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section.

(2) Comply with the first set of requirements, identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vi) of this section, which applies to any individual emission stream that is included in the combined stream, where either that emission stream would be classified as Group 1 in the absence of combination with other emission streams, or the owner or operator chooses to consider that emission stream to be Group 1 for purposes of this paragraph. Compliance with the first applicable set of requirements identified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vi) of this section constitutes compliance with all other requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vi) of this section applicable to other types of emissions in the combined stream.

(i) The requirements of this subpart for Group 1 continuous process vents subject to § 63.1315, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;

(ii) The requirements of § 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), § 63.1316(b)(1)(ii), § 63.1316(b)(2)(i), § 63.1316(b)(2)(ii), or § 63.1316(c)(1), excluding § 63.1316(c)(1)(ii), as appropriate, for control of emissions from continuous process vents subject to the control requirements of § 63.1316, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements;

(iii) The requirements of § 63.119(e), as specified in § 63.1314, for control of emissions from Group 1 storage vessels, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;

(iv) The requirements of § 63.139, as specified in § 63.1330, for control devices used to control emissions from waste management units, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting;

(v) The requirements of § 63.139, as specified in § 63.1330, for closed vent systems for control of emissions from in-process equipment subject to § 63.149, as specified in § 63.1330, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting; or

(vi) The requirements of this subpart for aggregate batch vent streams subject to § 63.1321(c), including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.

(3) The owner or operator of an affected source with combined emission streams containing one or more batch process vents but not containing one or more continuous process vents subject to § 63.1315, § 63.1316(b)(1)(i)(A), § 63.1316(b)(1)(ii), § 63.1316(b)(2)(i), § 63.1316(b)(2)(ii), or § 63.1316(c)(1), excluding § 63.1316(c)(1)(ii), shall comply with paragraph (b)(3)(i) and (b)(3)(ii) of this section.

(i) The owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with § 63.1321 for the batch process vent(s).

(ii) The owner or operator of the affected source shall comply with either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as appropriate, for the remaining emission streams.

(c) Instead of complying with §§ 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 63.1321, and 63.1330, the owner or operator of an existing affected source may elect to control any or all of the storage vessels, batch process vents, aggregate batch vent streams, continuous process vents, and wastewater streams and associated waste management units within the affected source to different levels using an emissions averaging compliance approach that uses the procedures specified in § 63.1332. The restrictions concerning which emission points may be included in an emissions average, including how many emission points may be included, are specified in § 63.1332(a)(1). An owner or operator electing to use emissions averaging shall still comply with the provisions of §§ 63.1314, 63.1315, 63.1316 through 63.1320, 63.1321, and 63.1330 for affected source emission points not included in the emissions average.

(d) A State may decide not to allow the use of the emissions averaging compliance approach specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
