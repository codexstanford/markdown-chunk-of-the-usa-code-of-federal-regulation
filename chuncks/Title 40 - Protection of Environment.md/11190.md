###### § 52.230 Control strategy and regulations: Nitrogen dioxide.

(a) The requirements of § 52.14(c)(3) of this chapter as of September 22, 1972 (47 FR 1983), are not met since the plan does not provide for the degree of nitrogen oxides emission reduction attainable through application of reasonably available control technology in the Metropolitan Los Angeles Intrastate Region. Therefore, Rule 68.b of the Orange County Air Pollution Control District is disapproved.

(b) The following rules are disapproved since they are not part of the approved control strategy and do not provide for the degree of control necessary for the attainment and maintenance of NAAQS for nitrogen dioxide in the Metropolitan Los Angeles Intrastate AQCR:

(1) Orange County APCD, Regulation IV, Rule 474, Fuel Burning Equipment-Oxides of Nitrogen, submitted on February 10, 1977.

(c) The rescission by the Southern California APCD of the following rules is disapproved since adequate replacement rules have not been submitted and no analysis has been presented to show that this rescission will not interfere with the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards as required by section 110 of the Clean Air Act. In addition, the following rules, as submitted in June 1972 and approved for the SIP, remain federally enforceable:

(1) Orange County APCD, Regulation IV, Rule 68, Fuel Burning Equipment-NOx.

(2) Orange County APCD, Regulation IV, Rule 67.1, Fuel Burning Equipment.
