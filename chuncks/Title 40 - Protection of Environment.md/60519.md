####### General.

(a)(1) Tolerances for residues of the insecticide pyrethrins ((1S)-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-(2Z)-2,4-pentadienylcyclopenten-1-yl (1R,3R)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate (pyrethrin 1), (1S)-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-(2Z)-2,4-pentadienyl-2-cyclopenten-1-yl (1R,3R)-3-[(1E)-3-methoxy-2-methyl-3-oxo-1-propenyl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-carboxylate (pyrethrin 2), (1S)-3-(2Z)-2-butenyl-2-methyl-4-oxo-2-cyclopenten-1-yl (1R,3R)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate (cinerin 1), (1S)-3-(2Z)-2-butenyl-2-methyl-4-oxo-2-cyclopenten-1-yl (1R,3R)-3-[(1E)-3-methoxy-2-methyl-3-oxo-1-propenyl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (cinerin 2), (1S)-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-(2Z)-2-pentenyl-2-cyclopenten-1-yl (1R, 3R)-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-1-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate (jasmolin 1), and (1S)-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-(2Z)-pentenyl-2-cyclopenten-1-yl (1R,3R)-3-[(1E)-3-methoxy-2-methyl-3-oxo-1-propenyl]-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (jasmolin 2)), the insecticidally active principles of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium, which are measured as cumulative residues of pyrethrin 1, cinerin 1, and jasmolin 1 are not to exceed the following:

(2) A tolerance of 1.0 ppm is established for residues of the insecticide pyrethrins in or on milled fractions derived from grain, cereal when present as a result of its use in cereal grain mills and in storage areas for milled cereal grain products.

(3) A tolerance of 1.0 ppm is established for residues of the insecticide pyrethrins in or on all food items in food handling establishments where food and food products are held, processed, prepared and/or served. Food must be removed or covered prior to use.

(4) Where tolerances are established on both the raw agricultural commodities and processed foods made there-from, the total residues of pyrethrins in or on the processed food shall not be greater than that permitted by the larger of the two tolerances.
