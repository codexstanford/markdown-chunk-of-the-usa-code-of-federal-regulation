######## By-product hydrogen streams and end box ventilation system vents.

(a)You must determine the total grams of mercury per Megagram of chlorine production (g Hg/Mg Cl) of chlorine produced from all by-product hydrogen streams and all end box ventilation system vents, if applicable, at a mercury cell chlor-alkali production facility, and you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section.

(1) Determine the mercury emission rate for each test run in grams per day for each by-product hydrogen stream and for each end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, from Method 101, 101A, or 102 (40 CFR part 61, appendix A).

(2) Calculate the average measured electric current through the operating mercury cells during each test run for each by-product hydrogen stream and for each end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, using Equation 1 of this section as follows:

(3) Calculate the amount of chlorine produced during each test run for each by-product hydrogen stream and for each end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, using Equation 2 of this section as follows:

(4) Calculate the mercury emission rate in grams of mercury per megagram of chlorine produced for each test run for each by-product hydrogen stream and for each end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, using Equation 3 of this section as follows:

(5) Calculate the average mercury emission rate for each by-product hydrogen stream and for each end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, using Equation 4 of this section as follows:

(6) Calculate the total mercury emission rate from all by-product hydrogen streams and all end box ventilation system vents, if applicable, at the mercury cell chlor-alkali production facility using Equation 5 of this section as follows:
