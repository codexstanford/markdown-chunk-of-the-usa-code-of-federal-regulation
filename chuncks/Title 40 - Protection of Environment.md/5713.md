(b) Any such request must show that attainment of the secondary standards will require emission reductions exceeding those which can be achieved through the application of reasonably available control technology.

(c) Any such request for extension of the deadline with respect to any State's portion of an interstate region must be submitted jointly with requests for such extensions from all other States within the region or must show that all such States have been notified of such request.

(d) Any such request must be submitted sufficiently early to permit development of a plan prior to the deadline in the event that such request is denied.
