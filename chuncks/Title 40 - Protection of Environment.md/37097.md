###### General Standards
####### § 63.7884 What are the general standards I must meet for each site remediation with affected sources?

(a) For each site remediation with an affected source designated under § 63.7882, you must meet the standards specified in §§ 63.7885 through 63.7955, as applicable to your affected source, unless your site remediation meets the requirements for an exemption under paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) A site remediation that is completed within 30 consecutive calendar days according to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section is not subject to the standards under paragraph (a) of this section. This exemption cannot be used for a site remediation involving the staged or intermittent cleanup of remediation material whereby the remediation activities at the site are started, stopped, and then re-started in a series of intervals, with durations less than 30-days per interval, when the time period from the beginning of the first interval to the end of the last interval exceeds 30 days.

(1) The 30 consecutive calendar day period for a site remediation that qualifies for this exemption is determined according to actions taken by you as defined in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(i) The first day of the 30-day period is defined as the day on which you initiate any action that removes, destroys, degrades, transforms, immobilizes, or otherwise manages the remediation materials. The following activities, when completed before beginning this initial action, are not counted as part of the 30-day period: Activities to characterize the type and extent of the contamination by collecting and analyzing samples; activities to obtain permits from Federal, State, or local authorities to conduct the site remediation; activities to schedule workers and necessary equipment; and activities to arrange for contractor or third party assistance in performing the site remediation.

(ii) The last day of the 30-day period is defined as the day on which treatment or disposal of all of the remediation materials generated by the cleanup is completed such that the organic constituents in these materials no longer have a reasonable potential for volatilizing and being released to the atmosphere.

(iii) If treatment or disposal of the remediation materials is conducted at an off-site facility where the final treatment or disposal of the material cannot, or may not, be completed within the 30-day exemption period, then the shipment of all of the remediation material generated from your cleanup that is transferred to another party, or shipped to another facility, within the 30-day period, must be performed according to the applicable requirements specified in § 63.7936.

(2) For the purpose of complying with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if you ship or otherwise transfer the remediation material off-site you must include in the applicable shipping documentation, in addition to any notifications and certifications required under § 63.7936, a statement that the shipped material was generated by a site remediation activity subject to the conditions of this exemption. The statement must include the date on which you initiated the site remediation activity generating the shipped remediation materials, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, and the date 30 calendar days following your initiation date.

(3) You must prepare and maintain at your facility written documentation describing the exempted site remediation, and listing the initiation and completion dates for the site remediation.
