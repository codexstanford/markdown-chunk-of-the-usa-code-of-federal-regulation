(a) For any web coating line or group of web coating lines for which you use add-on control devices to demonstrate compliance with the emission standards in § 63.3320, unless you use a solvent recovery system and conduct a liquid-liquid material balance, you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart or according to paragraph (b) of this section.
