###### § 13.9 Initial notice.

(a) When the Administrator determines that a debt is owed EPA, he provides a written initial notice to the debtor. Unless otherwise provided by agreement, contract or order, the initial notice informs the debtor:

(1) Of the amount, nature and basis of the debt;

(2) That payment is due immediately upon receipt of the notice;

(3) That the debt is considered delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days of the date mailed or hand-delivered;

(4) That interest charges and, except for State and local governments and Indian tribes, penalty charges and administrative costs may be assessed against a delinquent debt;

(5) Of any rights available to the debtor to dispute the validity of the debt or to have recovery of the debt waived (citing the available review or waiver authority, the conditions for review or waiver, and the effects of the review or waiver request on the collection of the debt), and of the possibility of assessment of interest, penalty and administrative costs; and

(6) The address, telephone number and name of the person available to discuss the debt.

(b) EPA will respond promptly to communications from the debtor. Response generally will be within 20 days of receipt of communication from the debtor.

(c) Subsequent demand letters also will advise the debtor of any interest, penalty or administrative costs which have been assessed and will advise the debtor that the debt may be referred to a credit reporting agency (see § 13.14), a collection agency (see § 13.13) or to DOJ (see § 13.33) if it is not paid.
