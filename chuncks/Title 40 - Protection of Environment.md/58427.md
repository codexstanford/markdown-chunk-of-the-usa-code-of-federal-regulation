###### § 156.66 Child hazard warning.

(a) Each pesticide product must bear on the front panel of the label the statement "Keep Out of Reach of Children." That statement, or any alternative statement approved by EPA, must appear on a separate line in close proximity to the signal word, if required. The statement is required on Toxicity Category IV products that do not otherwise require a signal word.

(b) In its discretion, EPA may waive the requirement, or require or permit an alternative child hazard warning, if:

(1) The applicant can demonstrate that the likelihood of exposure of children to the pesticide during distribution, marketing, storage or use is remote (for example, an industrial use product); or

(2) The pesticide is approved for use on children (for example, an insect repellent).

(c) EPA may approve an alternative child hazard warning that more appropriately reflects the nature of the pesticide product to which children may be exposed (for example, an impregnated pet collar). In this case, EPA may also approve placement on other than the front panel.
