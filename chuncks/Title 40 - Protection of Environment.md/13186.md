###### § 52.828 Enforcement.

(a) Sections 23(1)(b) and 13(7) of Senate File 85, Division II for Iowa are disapproved insofar as they permit the Air Quality Commission of the Iowa Department of Environmental Quality to issue abatement orders (1) that defer compliance with plan requirements beyond the dates required for attainment of the national standards, (2) without the approval of the Administrator, and (3) for reasons not permitted by the Clean Air Act.

(b) Regulation limiting administrative abatement orders:

(1) No order deferring compliance with a requirement of the Iowa Implementation Plan shall be issued by the Air Quality Commission of the Iowa Department of Environmental Quality which does not meet the following requirements:

(i) An order must require compliance with the plan requirement within the times and under the conditions specified in § 51.261 (a) and (b) of this chapter.

(ii) An order may not defer compliance beyond the last date permitted by section 110 of the Act for attainment of the national standard which the plan implements unless the procedures and conditions set forth in section 110(f) of the Act are met.

(iii) An order shall not be effective until it has been submitted to and approved by the Administrator in accordance with §§ 51.104, 51.105, 51.261 and 51.262(a).

(2) Notwithstanding the limitations of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, an order may be granted which provides for compliance beyond the statutory attainment date for a national standard where compliance is not possible because of breakdowns or malfunctions of equipment, acts of God, or other unavoidable occurrences. However, such order may not defer compliance for more than three (3) months unless the procedures and conditions set forth in section 110(f) of the Act are met.
