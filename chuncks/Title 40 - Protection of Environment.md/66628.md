(1) Liquids or materials containing free liquids are not placed in the pile;

(2) The pile is protected from surface water run-on by the structure or in some other manner;

(3) The pile is designed and operated to control dispersal of the waste by wind, where necessary, by means other than wetting; and

(4) The pile will not generate leachate through decomposition or other reactions.
