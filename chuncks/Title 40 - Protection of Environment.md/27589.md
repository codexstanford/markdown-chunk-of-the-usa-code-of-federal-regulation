###### § 63.688 Standards: Containers.

(a) The provisions of this section apply to the control of air emissions from containers for which § 63.683(b)(1)(i) of this subpart references the use of this section for such air emission control.

(b) The owner or operator shall control air emissions from each container subject to this section in accordance with the following requirements, as applicable to the container, except when the special provisions for waste stabilization processes specified in paragraph (c) of this section apply to the container.

(1) For a container having a design capacity greater than 0.1 mand less than or equal to 0.46 m, the owner or operator must control air emissions from the container in accordance with the requirements in either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(i) The owner or operator controls air emissions from the container in accordance with the standards for Container Level 1 controls as specified in subpart PP of this part-National Emission Standards for Containers, except that §§ 63.922(d)(4) and (5) and 63.923(d)(4) and (5) shall not apply for the purposes of this subpart.

(ii) As an alternative to meeting the requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, an owner or operator may choose to control air emissions from the container in accordance with the standards for either Container Level 2 controls or Container Level 3 controls as specified in subpart PP of this part-National Emission Standards for Containers, except that §§ 63.922(d)(4) and (5) and 63.923(d)(4) and (5) shall not apply for the purposes of this subpart.

(2) For a container having a design capacity greater than 0.46 mand the container is not in light-material service as defined in § 63.681 of this subpart, the owner or operator must control air emissions from the container in accordance with the requirements in either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(3) For a container having a design capacity greater than 0.46 mand the container is in light-material service as defined in § 63.681 of this subpart, the owner or operator must control air emissions from the container in accordance with the requirements in either paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (b)(3)(ii) of this section.

(i) The owner or operator controls air emissions from the container in accordance with the standards for Container Level 2 controls as specified in subpart PP of this part-National Emission Standards for Containers, except that §§ 63.922(d)(4) and (5) and 63.923(d)(4) and (5) shall not apply for the purposes of this subpart.

(ii) As an alternative to meeting the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator may choose to control air emissions from the container in accordance with the standards for Container Level 3 controls as specified in 40 CFR part 63, subpart PP-National Emission Standards for Containers.

(c) When a container subject to this subpart and having a design capacity greater than 0.1 mis used for treatment of an off-site material by a waste stabilization process as defined in § 63.681 of this subpart, the owner or operator shall control air emissions from the container at those times during the process when the off-site material in the container is exposed to the atmosphere in accordance with the standards for Container Level 3 controls as specified in 40 CFR part 63, subpart PP-National Emission Standards for Containers.
