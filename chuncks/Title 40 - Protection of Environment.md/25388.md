###### § 63.80 Enforcement.

(a) All base year or post-reduction emissions information described in § 63.74 and required to be submitted as part of a permit application under § 63.77 or an enforceable commitment under § 63.75 shall be considered to have been requested by the Administrator under the authority of section 114 of the Act.

(b) Fraudulent statements contained in any base year or post-reduction emissions submitted to a State or EPA Regional Office under this subpart shall be considered violations of section 114 of the Act and of this subpart and, thus, actionable under section 113 of the Act and can be considered, in appropriate cases, violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001, the general false swearing provision of the United States Code.

(c) If a source subject to an enforceable commitment fails to achieve reductions before January 1, 1994, sufficient to qualify the source for an extension under this subpart, the source shall be considered to be in violation of the commitment and shall be subject to enforcement action under section 113 of the Act.

(d) If an early reduction demonstration in a permit application filed under § 63.77 is disapproved for a source not subject to an enforceable commitment, the owner or operator shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act by the compliance date specified in such standard.

(e) If an early reduction demonstration in a permit application filed under § 63.77 is disapproved for a source that is subject to an enforceable commitment, the owner or operator shall comply with an applicable standard issued under section 112(d) of the Act by the compliance date specified in such standard and will be subject to enforcement action under section 113 of the Act.

(f) A violation of an alternative emission limitation or other requirement established by permit under § 63.79 (a) or (b) for the source is enforceable pursuant to the authority of section 113 of the Act notwithstanding any demonstration of continuing 90 percent (95 percent for hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) emission reduction over the entire source.
