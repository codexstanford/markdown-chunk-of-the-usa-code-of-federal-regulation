####### § 60.4350 How do I use data from the continuous emission monitoring equipment to identify excess emissions?

For purposes of identifying excess emissions:

(a) All CEMS data must be reduced to hourly averages as specified in § 60.13(h).

(b) For each unit operating hour in which a valid hourly average, as described in § 60.4345(b), is obtained for both NOand diluent monitors, the data acquisition and handling system must calculate and record the hourly NOemission rate in units of ppm or lb/MMBtu, using the appropriate equation from method 19 in appendix A of this part. For any hour in which the hourly average Oconcentration exceeds 19.0 percent O(or the hourly average COconcentration is less than 1.0 percent CO), a diluent cap value of 19.0 percent Oor 1.0 percent CO(as applicable) may be used in the emission calculations.

(c) Correction of measured NOconcentrations to 15 percent Ois not allowed.

(d) If you have installed and certified a NOdiluent CEMS to meet the requirements of part 75 of this chapter, states can approve that only quality assured data from the CEMS shall be used to identify excess emissions under this subpart. Periods where the missing data substitution procedures in subpart D of part 75 are applied are to be reported as monitor downtime in the excess emissions and monitoring performance report required under § 60.7(c).

(e) All required fuel flow rate, steam flow rate, temperature, pressure, and megawatt data must be reduced to hourly averages.

(f) Calculate the hourly average NOemission rates, in units of the emission standards under § 60.4320, using either ppm for units complying with the concentration limit or the following equation for units complying with the output based standard:

(1) For simple-cycle operation:

(2) For combined-cycle and combined heat and power complying with the output-based standard, use Equation 1 of this subpart, except that the gross energy output is calculated as the sum of the total electrical and mechanical energy generated by the combustion turbine, the additional electrical or mechanical energy (if any) generated by the steam turbine following the heat recovery steam generator, and 100 percent of the total useful thermal energy output that is not used to generate additional electricity or mechanical output, expressed in equivalent MW, as in the following equations:

(3) For mechanical drive applications complying with the output-based standard, use the following equation:

(g) For simple cycle units without heat recovery, use the calculated hourly average emission rates from paragraph (f) of this section to assess excess emissions on a 4-hour rolling average basis, as described in § 60.4380(b)(1).

(h) For combined cycle and combined heat and power units with heat recovery, use the calculated hourly average emission rates from paragraph (f) of this section to assess excess emissions on a 30 unit operating day rolling average basis, as described in § 60.4380(b)(1).
