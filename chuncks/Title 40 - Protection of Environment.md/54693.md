###### § 125.135 May alternative requirements be authorized?

(a) Any interested person may request that alternative requirements less stringent than those specified in § 125.134(a) through (d) be imposed in the permit. The Director may establish alternative requirements less stringent than the requirements of § 125.134(a) through (d) only if:

(1) There is an applicable requirement under § 125.134(a) through (d);

(2) The Director determines that data specific to the facility indicate that compliance with the requirement at issue would result in compliance costs wholly out of proportion to the costs EPA considered in establishing the requirement at issue or would result in significant adverse impacts on local water resources other than impingement or entrainment, or significant adverse impacts on energy markets;

(3) The alternative requirement requested is no less stringent than justified by the wholly out of proportion cost or the significant adverse impacts on local water resources other than impingement or entrainment, or significant adverse impacts on energy markets; and

(4) The alternative requirement will ensure compliance with other applicable provisions of the Clean Water Act and any applicable requirement of federal or state law.

(b) The burden is on the person requesting the alternative requirement to demonstrate that alternative requirements should be authorized.
