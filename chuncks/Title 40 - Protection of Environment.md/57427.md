###### § 146.73 Financial responsibility for post-closure care.

The owner or operator shall demonstrate and maintain financial responsibility for post-closure by using a trust fund, surety bond, letter of credit, financial test, insurance or corporate guarantee that meets the specifications for the mechanisms and instruments revised as appropriate to cover closure and post-closure care in 40 CFR part 144, subpart F. The amount of the funds available shall be no less than the amount identified in § 146.72(a)(4)(vi). The obligation to maintain financial responsibility for post-closure care survives the termination of a permit or the cessation of injection. The requirement to maintain financial responsibility is enforceable regardless of whether the requirement is a condition of the permit.
