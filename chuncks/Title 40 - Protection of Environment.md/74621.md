Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and must achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES).

(a)(1) The following pretreatment standards apply with respect to each fiber line operated by an indirect discharger subject to this section, unless the indirect discharger discloses to the pretreatment control authority in a report submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(b) that it uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes at that fiber line. These pretreatment standards must be attained on or before April 16, 2001:
