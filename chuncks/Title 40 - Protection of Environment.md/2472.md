###### Who Is Eligible?
####### § 35.4040 How many groups can receive a TAG at one Superfund site?

(a) Only one TAG may be awarded for a site at any one time. However, the recipient of the grant can be changed when:

(1) EPA and the recipient mutually agree to terminate the current TAG or the recipient or EPA unilaterally terminates the TAG; or

(2) The recipient elects not to renew its grant even though it is eligible for additional funding.

(b) In each of the situations described in paragraph (a) of this section the following information applies:

(1) If you are a subsequent recipient of a TAG, you are not responsible for actions taken by the first recipient, nor are you responsible for how the first recipient expended the funds received from EPA; and

(2) The process for changing recipients begins when an interested applicant submits a Letter of Intent ("LOI") to the Agency expressing interest in a TAG as described in § 35.4105. We will then follow the application procedure set forth at §§ 35.4105 through 35.4165.
