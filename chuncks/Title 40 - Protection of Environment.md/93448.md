(a) A person who intends to manufacture, import, or process a microorganism identified in subpart M of this part and who intends to distribute it in commerce is not required to submit a MCAN under subpart D of this part, if that person can document one or more of the following as to each recipient of the microorganism from that person:

(1) That the person has notified the recipient, in writing, of the specific section in subpart M of this part which identifies the microorganism and its designated significant new uses, or

(3) That the recipient cannot undertake any significant new use described in the specific section in subpart M of this part.

(b) The manufacturer, importer, or processor described in paragraph (a) of this section must submit a MCAN under subpart D of this part, if such person has knowledge at the time of commercial distribution of the microorganism identified in the specific section in subpart M of this part that a recipient intends to engage in a designated significant new use of that microorganism without submitting a MCAN under this part.

(c) A person who processes a microorganism identified in a specific section in subpart M of this part for a significant new use of that microorganism is not required to submit a MCAN if that person can document each of the following:

(1) That the person does not know the specific microorganism identity of the microorganism being processed, and

(d)(1) If at any time after commencing distribution in commerce of a microorganism identified in a specific section in subpart M of this part, a person who manufactures, imports, or processes a microorganism described in subpart M of this part and distributes it in commerce has knowledge that a recipient of the microorganism is engaging in a significant new use of that microorganism designated in that section without submitting a MCAN under this part, the person is required to cease supplying the microorganism to that recipient and to submit a MCAN for that microorganism and significant new use, unless the person is able to document each of the following:

(i) That the person has notified the recipient and EPA enforcement authorities (at the address in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section), in writing within 15 working days of the time the person develops knowledge that the recipient is engaging in a significant new use, that the recipient is engaging in a significant new use without submitting a MCAN.

(2) If EPA notifies the manufacturer, importer, or processor that the recipient is engaging in a significant new use after providing the statement of assurance described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and without submitting a MCAN under this part, the manufacturer, importer, or processor shall immediately cease distribution to that recipient until the manufacturer, importer, or processor or the recipient has submitted a MCAN under this part and the MCAN review period has ended.

(3) If, after receiving a statement of assurance from a recipient under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, a manufacturer, importer, or processor has knowledge that the recipient is engaging in a significant new use without submitting a MCAN under this part, the manufacturer, importer, or processor must immediately cease distributing the microorganism to that recipient and notify EPA enforcement authorities at the address identified in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section. The manufacturer, importer, or processor may not resume distribution to that recipient until any one of the following has occurred:

(i) The manufacturer, importer, or processor has submitted a MCAN under this part and the MCAN review period has ended.

(ii) The recipient has submitted a MCAN under this part and the MCAN review period has ended.
