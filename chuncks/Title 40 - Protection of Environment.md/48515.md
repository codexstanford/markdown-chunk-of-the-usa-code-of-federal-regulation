####### § 96.4 Applicability.

(a) The following units in a State shall be NOBudget units, and any source that includes one or more such units shall be a NOBudget source, subject to the requirements of this part:

(1) Any unit that, any time on or after January 1, 1995, serves a generator with a nameplate capacity greater than 25 MWe and sells any amount of electricity; or

(2) Any unit that is not a unit under paragraph (a) of this section and that has a maximum design heat input greater than 250 mmBtu/hr.

(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a unit under paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject only to the requirements of this paragraph (b) if the unit has a federally enforceable permit that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section and restricts the unit to burning only natural gas or fuel oil during a control period in 2003 or later and each control period thereafter and restricts the unit's operating hours during each such control period to the number of hours (determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section) that limits the unit's potential NOmass emissions for the control period to 25 tons or less. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, starting with the effective date of such federally enforceable permit, the unit shall not be a NOBudget unit.

(1) For each control period under paragraph (b) of this section, the federally enforceable permit must:

(i) Restrict the unit to burning only natural gas or fuel oil.

(ii) Restrict the unit's operating hours to the number calculated by dividing 25 tons of potential NOmass emissions by the unit's maximum potential hourly NOmass emissions.

(iii) Require that the unit's potential NOmass emissions shall be calculated as follows:

(A) Select the default NOemission rate in Table 2 of § 75.19 of this chapter that would otherwise be applicable assuming that the unit burns only the type of fuel (i.e., only natural gas or only fuel oil) that has the highest default NOemission factor of any type of fuel that the unit is allowed to burn under the fuel use restriction in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section; and

(B) Multiply the default NOemission rate under paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section by the unit's maximum rated hourly heat input. The owner or operator of the unit may petition the permitting authority to use a lower value for the unit's maximum rated hourly heat input than the value as defined under § 96.2. The permitting authority may approve such lower value if the owner or operator demonstrates that the maximum hourly heat input specified by the manufacturer or the highest observed hourly heat input, or both, are not representative, and that such lower value is representative, of the unit's current capabilities because modifications have been made to the unit, limiting its capacity permanently.

(iv) Require that the owner or operator of the unit shall retain at the source that includes the unit, for 5 years, records demonstrating that the operating hours restriction, the fuel use restriction, and the other requirements of the permit related to these restrictions were met.

(v) Require that the owner or operator of the unit shall report the unit's hours of operation (treating any partial hour of operation as a whole hour of operation) during each control period to the permitting authority by November 1 of each year for which the unit is subject to the federally enforceable permit.

(2) The permitting authority that issues the federally enforceable permit with the fuel use restriction under paragraph (b)(1)(i) and the operating hours restriction under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section will notify the Administrator in writing of each unit under paragraph (a) of this section whose federally enforceable permit issued by the permitting authority includes such restrictions. The permitting authority will also notify the Administrator in writing of each unit under paragraph (a) of this section whose federally enforceable permit issued by the permitting authority is revised to remove any such restriction, whose federally enforceable permit issued by the permitting authority includes any such restriction that is no longer applicable, or which does not comply with any such restriction.

(3) If, for any control period under paragraph (b) of this section, the fuel use restriction under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section or the operating hours restriction under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section is removed from the unit's federally enforceable permit or otherwise becomes no longer applicable or if, for any such control period, the unit does not comply with the fuel use restriction under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section or the operating hours restriction under paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the unit shall be a NOBudget unit, subject to the requirements of this part. Such unit shall be treated as commencing operation and, for a unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, commencing commercial operation on September 30 of the control period for which the fuel use restriction or the operating hours restriction is no longer applicable or during which the unit does not comply with the fuel use restriction or the operating hours restriction.
