###### § 60.372 Standards for lead.

(a) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere:

(1) From any grid casting facility any gases that contain lead in excess of 0.40 milligram of lead per dry standard cubic meter of exhaust (0.000175 gr/dscf).

(2) From any paste mixing facility any gases that contain in excess of 1.00 milligram of lead per dry standard cubic meter of exhaust (0.000437 gr/dscf).

(3) From any three-process operation facility any gases that contain in excess of 1.00 milligram of lead per dry standard cubic meter of exhaust (0.000437 gr/dscf).

(4) From any lead oxide manufacturing facility any gases that contain in excess of 5.0 milligrams of lead per kilogram of lead feed (0.010 lb/ton).

(5) From any lead reclamation facility any gases that contain in excess of 4.50 milligrams of lead per dry standard cubic meter of exhaust (0.00197 gr/dscf).

(6) From any other lead-emitting operation any gases that contain in excess of 1.00 milligram of lead per dry standard cubic meter of exhaust (0.000437 gr/dscf).

(7) From any affected facility other than a lead reclamation facility any gases with greater than 0 percent opacity (measured according to Method 9 and rounded to the nearest whole percentage).

(8) From any lead reclamation facility any gases with greater than 5 percent opacity (measured according to Method 9 and rounded to the nearest whole percentage).

(b) When two or more facilities at the same plant (except the lead oxide manufacturing facility) are ducted to a common control device, an equivalent standard for the total exhaust from the commonly controlled facilities shall be determined as follows:
