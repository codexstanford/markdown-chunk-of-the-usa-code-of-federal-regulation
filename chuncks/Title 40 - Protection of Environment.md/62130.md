##### Subpart C - Specific Tolerances
###### § 180.723 Spiropidion; tolerances for residues.
####### General.

(a)(1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide spiropidion, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 1 to this paragraph (a)(1). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 1 to this paragraph (a)(1) is to be determined by measuring only the sum of spiropidion [3-(4-chloro-2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-8-methoxy-1-methyl-2-oxo-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]dec-3-en-4-yl ethyl carbonate] and its metabolite SYN547305 [3-(4-chloro-2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-8-methoxy-1-methyl-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione; and 2-(4-chloro-2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-1-hydroxy-8-methoxy-4-methyl-4,8-diazaspiro[4.5]dec-1-en-3-one], calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of spiropidion, in or on the following plant commodities:

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide spiropidion, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 2 to this paragraph (a)(2). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 2 to this paragraph (a)(2) is to be determined by measuring only SYN547305 [3-(4-chloro-2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-8-methoxy-1-methyl-1,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione; and 2-(4-chloro-2,6-dimethyl-phenyl)-1-hydroxy-8-methoxy-4-methyl-4,8-diazaspiro[4.5]dec-1-en-3-one], calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of spiropidion, in or on the following livestock commodities:
