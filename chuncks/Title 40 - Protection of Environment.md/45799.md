(2) All other components which must be adjusted, repaired or replaced to enable a component adjusted, repaired, or replaced under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to perform properly.

(b) Manufacturers shall be liable for the total cost of the remedy for any vehicle validly presented for repair under an emission warranty to any authorized service facility authorized by the vehicle manufacturer.
