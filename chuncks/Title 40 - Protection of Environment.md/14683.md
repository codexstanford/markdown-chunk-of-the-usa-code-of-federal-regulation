(b) The Lane Regional Air Protection Agency rules for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality (provisions of LRAPA Titles 12, 29, 31, 37, 38 (except 0510(3) inter-pollutant offset ratios), 40, 42, and 50) as in effect March 23, 2018, are approved as meeting the requirements of title I, part C, subpart I of the Clean Air Act for preventing significant deterioration of air quality.

(c) The requirements of sections 160 through 165 of the Clean Air Act are not met for Indian reservations since the plan does not include approvable procedures for preventing the significant deterioration of air quality on Indian reservations and, therefore, the provisions in § 52.21 except paragraph (a)(1) are hereby incorporated and made part of the applicable plan for Indian reservations in the State of Oregon.
