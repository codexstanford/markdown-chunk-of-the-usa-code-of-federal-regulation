###### § 60.736 Test methods and procedures.

(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).

(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.732 as follows:

(1) Method 5 shall be used to determine the particulate matter concentration. The sampling time and volume for each test run shall be at least 2 hours and 1.70 dscm.

(2) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity from stack emissions.

(c) During the initial performance test of a wet scrubber, the owner or operator shall use the monitoring devices of § 60.734(d) to determine the average change in pressure of the gas stream across the scrubber and the average flowrate of the scrubber liquid during each of the particulate matter runs. The arithmetic averages of the three runs shall be used as the baseline average values for the purposes of § 60.735(c).
