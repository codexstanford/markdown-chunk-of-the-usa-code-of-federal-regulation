###### § 46.190 Fellowship agreement amendments.

(a) If you need to make any of the changes listed in paragraphs (a)(1) thorough (3) of this section, you must notify the project officer and receive a formal amendment (EPA Form 5770-8) approving the changes. You must sign and return one copy of each amendment to the award official. If you make the change before you receive the amendment, you do so at your own risk. Changes that require formal amendments are:

(1) A change in the amount of the fellowship;

(2) A change in the academic institution you attend; or

(3) A change in the duration of your fellowship.

(b) You must obtain the EPA project officer's written approval of changes in the field of study or approved research project.

(c) You do not need EPA approval of minor changes that are consistent with the objective of the fellowship agreement. Minor changes do not, however, obligate EPA to provide additional funds for any costs you incur in excess of the fellowship agreement amount.
