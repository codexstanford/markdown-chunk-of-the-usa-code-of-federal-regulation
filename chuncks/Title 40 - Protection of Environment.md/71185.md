###### What Can Be Reimbursed?
####### § 310.11 What costs are allowable?

(a) Reimbursement under this part does NOT supplant funds you normally provide for emergency response. Allowable costs are only those necessary for you to respond effectively to a specific incident that is beyond what you might normally respond to.

(b) Examples of allowable costs are:

(1) Disposable materials and supplies you acquired and used to respond to the specific incident;

(2) Payment of unbudgeted wages for employees responding to the specific incident (for example, overtime pay for response personnel);

(3) Rental or leasing of equipment you used to respond to the specific incident (for example, protective equipment or clothing, scientific and technical equipment) (Note: rental costs are only allowable for the duration of your response; once you complete the response to the specific incident, further rental costs are NOT allowable);

(4) Replacement costs for equipment you own that is contaminated or damaged beyond reuse or repair, if you can demonstrate that the equipment is a total loss and that the loss occurred during the response (for example, self-contained breathing apparatus irretrievably contaminated during the response);

(5) Decontamination of equipment contaminated during the response;

(6) Special technical services specifically required for the response (for example, costs associated with the time and efforts of technical experts/specialists that are not on your staff);

(7) Other special services specifically required for the response (for example, utilities);

(8) Laboratory costs of analyzing samples that you took during the response;

(9) Evacuation costs associated with the services, supplies, and equipment that you procured for a specific evacuation; and

(10) Containerization or packaging cost and transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes.

(c) To be allowable, costs must:

(1) NOT be higher than what a careful person would spend for similar products or services in your area; and

(2) Be consistent with CERCLA and the federal cost principles outlined in OMB Circular A-87, "Cost Principles for State and Local Governments." (Copies of the circular are available from the Office of Administration, Publications Office, New Executive Office Building, 725 17th Street, NW., Room 2200, Washington, DC 20503.)

(d) EPA will make final determinations on whether your costs are reasonable.
