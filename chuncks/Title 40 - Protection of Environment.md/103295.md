###### § 1065.695 Data requirements.

(a) To determine the information we require from engine tests, refer to the standard-setting part and request from your EPA Program Officer the format used to apply for certification or demonstrate compliance. We may require different information for different purposes, such as for certification applications, approval requests for alternate procedures, selective enforcement audits, laboratory audits, production-line test reports, and field-test reports.

(b) See the standard-setting part and § 1065.25 regarding recordkeeping.

(c) We may ask you the following about your testing, and we may ask you for other information as allowed under the Act:

(1) What approved alternate procedures did you use? For example:

(i) Partial-flow dilution for proportional PM.

(ii) CARB test procedures.

(iii) ISO test procedures.

(2) What laboratory equipment did you use? For example, the make, model, and description of the following:

(i) Engine dynamometer and operator demand.

(ii) Probes, dilution, transfer lines, and sample preconditioning components.

(iii) Batch storage media (such as the bag material or PM filter material).

(3) What measurement instruments did you use? For example, the make, model, and description of the following:

(i) Speed and torque instruments.

(ii) Flow meters.

(iii) Gas analyzers.

(iv) PM balance.

(4) When did you conduct calibrations and performance checks and what were the results? For example, the dates and results of the following:

(i) Linearity verification.

(vii) Absolute pressure, temperature, and dewpoint of intake and dilution air.

(viii) Simulated engine loads, curb idle transmission torque value.

(ix) Warm-idle speed value.

(x) Simulated vehicle signals applied during testing.

(xi) Bypassed governor controls during testing.

(xii) Date, time, and location of test (e.g., dynamometer laboratory identification).

(xiii) Cooling medium for engine and charge air.

(xiv) Operating temperatures of coolant, head, and block.

(xv) Natural or forced cool-down and cool-down time.

(xvi) Canister loading.

(8) How did you validate your testing? For example, results from the following:

(i) Duty cycle regression statistics for each test interval.

(ii) Proportional sampling.

(iii) Drift.

(iv) Reference PM sample media in PM-stabilization environment.

(v) Carbon balance error verification, if performed.

(9) How did you calculate results? For example, results from the following:

(i) Drift correction.

(ii) Noise correction.

(iii) "Dry-to-wet" correction.

(iv) NMHC, CH, and contamination correction.

(v) NOhumidity correction.
