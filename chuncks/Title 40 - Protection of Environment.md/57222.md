###### § 144.66 State assumption of responsibility.

(a) If a State either assumes legal responsibility for an owner's or operator's compliance with the plugging and abandonment requirements of these regulations or assures that funds will be available from State sources to cover these requirements, the owner or operator will be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart if the Regional Administrator determines that the State's assumption of responsibility is at least equivalent to the mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator will evaluate the equivalency of State guarantees mainly in terms of (1) certainty of the availability of funds for the required plugging and abandonment coverage and (2) the amount of funds that will be made available. The Regional Administrator may also consider other factors. The owner or operator must submit to the Regional Administrator a letter from the State describing the nature of the State's assumption of responsibility together with a letter from the owner or operator requesting that the State's asumption of responsibility be considered acceptable for meeting the requirements of this subpart. The letter from the State must include, or have attached to it, the following information: the facility's EPA Identification Number, name and address, and the amounts of funds for plugging and abandonment coverage that are guaranteed by the State. The Regional Administrator will notify the owner or operator of his determination regarding the acceptability of the State's guarantee in lieu of mechanisms specified in this subpart. The Regional Administrator may require the owner or operator to submit additional information as is deemed necessary to make this determination. Pending this determination, the owner or operator will be deemed to be in compliance with § 144.63.

(b) If a State's assumption of responsibility is found acceptable as specified in paragraph (a) of this section except for the amount of funds available, the owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of this subpart by use of both the State's assurance and additional financial mechanisms as specified in this subpart. The amount of funds available through the State and Federal mechanisms must at least equal the amount required by this subpart.
