###### What TAGs Can Pay For
####### § 35.4070 How can my group spend TAG money?

(a) Your group must use all or most of your funds to procure a technical advisor(s) to help you understand the nature of the environmental and public health hazards at the site, the various stages of health and environmental investigations and activities, cleanup, and "operation and maintenance" of a site, including exposure investigation, health study, surveillance program, health promotion activities (for example, medical monitoring and pediatric health units), remedial investigation, and feasibility study, record of decision, remedial design, selection and construction of remedial action, operation and maintenance, and removal action. This technical assistance should contribute to the public's ability to participate in the decision making process by improving the public's understanding of overall conditions and activities at the site.

(b) Your group may use a portion of your funds to:

(1) Undertake activities that communicate site information to the public through newsletters, public meetings or other similar activities;

(2) Procure a grant administrator to manage your group's grant; and/or

(3) Provide one-time health and safety training for your technical advisor to gain site access to your local Superfund site. To provide this training, you must:

(i) Obtain written approval from the EPA regional office; and

(ii) Not spend more than $1,000.00 for this training, including travel, lodging and other related costs.
