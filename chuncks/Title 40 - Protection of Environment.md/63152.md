###### § 205.160-7 Continued testing.

(a) If an SEA failure occurs according to paragraph (b) of § 205.160-6, the Administrator may require that any or all vehicles of that category, configuration or configuration subgroup produced at that plant be tested before distribution in commerce.

(b) The Administrator will notify the manufacturer in writing of his intent to require continued testing of vehicles under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The manufacturer may request a hearing on the issues of whether the SEA was conducted properly; whether the criteria for SEA failure have been met; and the appropriateness or scope of a continued testing order. If a hearing is requested, the hearing will begin no later than 15 days after the date on which the Administrator received the hearing request. Neither the request for a hearing nor the fact that a hearing is in progress will affect the responsibility of the manufacturer to commence and continue testing required by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) Any tested vehicle which demonstrates conformance with the applicable standard may be distributed into commerce.

(e) Any distribution into commerce of a vehicle which does not comply with the applicable standard is a prohibited act.
