###### § 63.74 Demonstration of early reduction.

(a) An owner or operator applying for an alternative emission limitation shall demonstrate achieving early reductions as required by § 63.72(a)(1) by following the procedures in this section.

(b) An owner or operator shall establish the source for the purposes of this subpart by documenting the following information:

(1) A description of the source including: a site plan of the entire contiguous plant site under common control which contains the source, markings on the site plan locating the parts of the site that constitute the source, and the activity at the source which causes hazardous air pollutant emissions;

(2) A complete list of all emission points of hazardous air pollutants in the source, including identification numbers and short descriptive titles; and

(3) A statement showing that the source conforms to one of the allowable definition options from § 63.73. For a source conforming to the option in § 63.73(a)(4), the total base year emissions from the source, as determined pursuant to this section, shall be demonstrated to be at least:

(i) 5 tons per year, for cases in which total hazardous air pollutant emissions from the entire contiguous plant site under common control are 25 tons per year or less as calculated under paragraph (1) of this section; or

(ii) 10 tons per year in all other cases.

(c) An owner or operator shall establish base year emissions for the source by providing the following information:

(1) The base year chosen, where the base year shall be 1987 or later except that the base year may be 1985 or 1986 if the owner or operator of the source can demonstrate that emission data for the source for 1985 or 1986 was submitted to the Administrator pursuant to an information request issued under section 114 of the Act and was received by the Administrator prior to November 15, 1990;

(2) The best available data accounting for actual emissions, during the base year, of all hazardous air pollutants from each emission point listed in the source in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

(3) The supporting basis for each emission number provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section including:

(i) For test results submitted as the supporting basis, a description of the test protocol followed, any problems encountered during the testing, and a discussion of the validity of the method for measuring the subject emissions; and

(ii) For calculations based on emission factors, material balance, or engineering principles and submitted as the supporting basis, a step-by-step description of the calculations, including assumptions used and their bases, and a brief rationale for the validity of the calculation method used; and

(4) Evidence that the emissions provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are not artificially or substantially greater than emissions in other years prior to implementation of emission reduction measures.

(d) An owner or operator shall establish post-reduction emissions by providing the following information:

(1) For the emission points listed in the source in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a description of all control measures employed to achieve the emission reduction required by § 63.72(a)(1);

(2) The best available data accounting for actual emissions, during the year following the applicable emission reduction deadline as specified in § 63.72(a)(2), of all hazardous air pollutants from each emission point in the source listed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(3) The supporting basis for each emission number provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section including:

(i) For test results submitted as the supporting basis, a description of the test protocol followed, any problems encountered during the testing, and a discussion of the validity of the method for measuring the subject emissions; and

(ii) For calculations based on emission factors, material balance, or engineering principles and submitted as the supporting basis, a step-by-step description of the calculations, including assumptions used and their bases, and a brief rationale for the validity of the calculation method used;

(4) [Reserved]

(5) Evidence that there was no increase in radionuclide emissions from the source.

(e)(1) An owner or operator shall demonstrate that both total base year emissions and total base year emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, as applicable, have been reduced by at least 90 percent for gaseous hazardous air pollutants emitted and 95 percent for particulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by determining the following for gaseous and particulate emissions separately:

(i) Total base year emissions, calculated by summing all base year emission data from paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

(ii) Total post-reduction emissions, calculated by summing all post-reduction emission data from paragraph (d)(2) of this section;

(iii) (If applicable) Total base year emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, calculated by multiplying each emission number for a pollutant from paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the appropriate weighting factor for the pollutant from Table 1 in paragraph (f) of this section and then summing all weighted emission data;

(iv) (If applicable) Total post-reduction emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants, calculated by multiplying each emission number for a pollutant from paragraph (d)(2) of this section by the appropriate weighting factor for the pollutant from Table 1 and then summing all weighted emission data; and

(v) Percent reductions, calculated by dividing the difference between base year and post-reduction emissions by the base year emissions. Separate demonstrations are required for total gaseous and particulate emissions, and total gaseous and particulate emissions adjusted for high-risk pollutants.

(2) If any points in the source emit both particulate and gaseous pollutants, as an alternative to the demonstration required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an owner or operator may demonstrate:

(i) A weighted average percent reduction for all points emitting both particulate and gaseous pollutants where the weighted average percent reduction is determined by

(ii) The reductions required in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for all other points in the source.

(f) If lower rates or hours are used to achieve all or part of the emission reduction, any hazardous air pollutant emissions that occur from a compensating increase in rates or hours from the same activity elsewhere within the plant site which contains the source shall be counted in the post-reduction emissions from the source. If emission reductions are achieved by shutting down process equipment and the shutdown equipment is restarted or replaced anywhere within the plant site, any hazardous air pollutant emissions from the restarted or replacement equipment shall be counted in the post-reduction emissions for the source.

(g) The best available data representing actual emissions for the purpose of establishing base year or post-reduction emissions under this section shall consist of documented results from source tests using an EPA Reference Method, EPA Conditional Method, or the owner's or operator's source test method which has been validated pursuant to Method 301 of appendix A of this part. However, if one of the following conditions exists, an owner or operator may submit, in lieu of results from source tests, calculations based on engineering principles, emission factors, or material balance data as actual emission data for establishing base year or post-reduction emissions:

(1) No applicable EPA Reference Method, EPA Conditional Method, or other source test method exists;

(2) It is not technologically or economically feasible to perform source tests;

(3) It can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the reviewing agency that the calculations will provide emission estimates of accuracy comparable to that of any applicable source test method;

(4) For base year emission estimates only, the base year conditions no longer exist at an emission point in the source and emission data could not be produced for such an emission point, by performing source tests under currently existing conditions and converting the test results to reflect base year conditions, that is more accurate than an estimate produced by using engineering principles, emission factors, or a material balance; or

(5) The emissions from one or a set of emission points in the source are small compared to total source emissions and potential errors in establishing emissions from such points will not have a significant effect on the accuracy of total emissions established for the source.

(h) For base year or post-reduction emissions established under this section that are not supported by source test data, the source owner or operator shall include the reason source testing was not performed.

(i) [Reserved]

(j) The EPA average emission factors for equipment leaks cannot be used under this subpart to establish base year emissions for equipment leak sources, unless the base year emission number calculated using the EPA average emission factors for equipment leaks also is used as the post-reduction emission number for equipment leaks from the source.

(k) A source owner or operator shall not establish base year or post-reduction emissions that include any emissions from the source exceeding allowable emission levels specified in any applicable law, regulation, or permit condition.

(l) For sources subject to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, an owner or operator shall document total base year emissions from an entire contiguous plant site under common control by providing the information required pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(2), and (e)(1)(i) of this section for all hazardous air pollutants from all emission points in the contiguous plant site under common control.

(m) If a new pollutant is added to the list of hazardous air pollutants or high-risk pollutants, any source emitting such pollutant will not be required to revise an early reduction demonstration pursuant to this section if:

(1) Alternative emission limits have previously been specified by permit for the source as provided for in § 63.72(a); or

(2) The base year emissions submitted in an enforceable commitment have previously been approved by the reviewing agency.
