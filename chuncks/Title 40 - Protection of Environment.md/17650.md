(g) Compliance with the emission limitation and percent reduction requirements under this section are both determined on a 30-day rolling average basis except as provided under paragraph (c) of this section.

(h) When different fuels are combusted simultaneously, the applicable standard is determined by proration using the following formula:

(1) If emissions of SOto the atmosphere are greater than 260 ng/J (0.60 lb/MMBtu) heat input
