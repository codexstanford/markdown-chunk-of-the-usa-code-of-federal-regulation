Record the volume of settled material in the cone as milliliters per liter. Where a separation of settleable and floating materials occurs, do not include the floating material in the reading. Notwithstanding any provision of 40 CFR part 136, the method detection limit for measuring settleable solids under this part shall be 0.4 ml/l.
