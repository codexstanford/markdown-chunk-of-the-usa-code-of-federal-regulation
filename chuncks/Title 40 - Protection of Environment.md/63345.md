(b) The manufacturer must not repair or adjust the test hearing protectors once compliance testing has been initiated. In the event a hearing protector is unable to complete the test, the manufacturer may replace the protector. Any replacement protector will be of the same category as the protector being replaced. It will be selected from the remaining designated test protectors and will be subject to all the provisions of these regulations. Any replacement and the reason for replacement must be reported in the compliance audit test report.
