###### Applicability and Compliance Dates
####### § 63.11448 Am I subject to this subpart?

You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a glass manufacturing facility that is an area source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions and meets all of the criteria specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

(a) A glass manufacturing facility is a plant site that manufactures flat glass, glass containers, or pressed and blown glass by melting a mixture of raw materials, as defined in § 63.11459, to produce molten glass and form the molten glass into sheets, containers, or other shapes.

(b) An area source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that does not have the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) (10 tons per year (tpy)) or more and any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 Mg/yr (25 tpy) or more.

(c) Your glass manufacturing facility uses one or more continuous furnaces to produce glass that contains compounds of one or more glass manufacturing metal HAP, as defined in § 63.11459, as raw materials in a glass manufacturing batch formulation.
