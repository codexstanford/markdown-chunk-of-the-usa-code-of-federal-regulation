### PART 1700 - UNIFORM NATIONAL DISCHARGE STANDARDS FOR VESSELS OF THE ARMED FORCES
#### Subpart D - Marine Pollution Control Device (MPCD) Performance Standards
##### § 1700.37 Underwater ship husbandry.

(a) For discharges from vessels that are less than 79 feet in length:

(1) To the greatest extent practicable, vessel hulls with an antifouling hull coating must not be cleaned within 90 days after the antifouling coating application.

(2) Vessel hulls must be inspected, maintained, and cleaned to minimize the removal and discharge of antifouling coatings and the transport of fouling organisms. To the greatest extent practicable, rigorous vessel hull cleanings must take place in drydock or at a land-based facility where the removed fouling organisms or spent antifouling coatings can be disposed of onshore in accordance with any applicable solid waste or hazardous substance management and disposal requirements.

(3) Prior to the transport of the vessel overland from one body of water to another, vessel hulls must be inspected for any visible attached living organisms. If fouling organisms are found, they must be removed and disposed of onshore in accordance with any applicable solid waste and hazardous substance management and disposal requirements.

(4) Vessel hull cleanings must be conducted in a manner that minimizes the release of antifouling hull coatings and fouling organisms, including:

(i) Adhere to any applicable cleaning requirements found on the coatings' FIFRA label.

(ii) Use soft brushes or less abrasive cleaning techniques to the greatest extent practicable.

(iii) Use hard brushes only for the removal of hard growth.

(iv) Use a vacuum or other collection/control technology, when available and feasible. Residues filtered, precipitated, or otherwise removed by any vacuum technology must be disposed of onshore in accordance with any applicable solid waste and hazardous substance management and disposal requirements.

(b) For discharges from vessels that are greater than or equal to 79 feet in length:

(1) To the greatest extent practicable, vessel hulls with an antifouling hull coating must not be cleaned within 90 days after the antifouling coating application. To the greatest extent practicable, vessel hulls with copper-based antifouling coatings must not be cleaned within 365 days after coating application.

(2) Vessel hulls must be inspected, maintained, and cleaned to minimize the removal and discharge of antifouling coatings and the transport of fouling organisms. To the greatest extent practicable, rigorous vessel hull cleanings must take place in drydock or at a land-based facility where the removed fouling organisms or spent antifouling coatings can be disposed of onshore in accordance with any applicable solid waste or hazardous substance management and disposal requirements.

(3) Vessel hull cleanings must be conducted in a manner that minimizes the release of antifouling hull coatings and fouling organisms, including:

(i) Adhere to any applicable cleaning requirements found on the coatings' FIFRA label.

(ii) Use soft brushes or less abrasive cleaning techniques to the greatest extent practicable.

(iii) Use hard brushes only for the removal of hard growth.

(iv) Use a vacuum or other collection/control technology, when available and feasible. Residues filtered, precipitated, or otherwise removed by any vacuum technology must be disposed of onshore in accordance with any applicable solid waste and hazardous substance management and disposal requirements.
