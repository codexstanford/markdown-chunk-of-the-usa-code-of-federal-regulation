###### § 51.307 New source review.

(a) For purposes of new source review of any new major stationary source or major modification that would be constructed in an area that is designated attainment or unclassified under section 107(d) of the CAA, the State plan must, in any review under § 51.166 with respect to visibility protection and analyses, provide for:

(1) Written notification of all affected Federal Land Managers of any proposed new major stationary source or major modification that may affect visibility in any Federal Class I area. Such notification must be made in writing and include a copy of all information relevant to the permit application within 30 days of receipt of and at least 60 days prior to public hearing by the State on the application for permit to construct. Such notification must include an analysis of the anticipated impacts on visibility in any Federal Class I area,

(2) Where the State requires or receives advance notification (e.g. early consultation with the source prior to submission of the application or notification of intent to monitor under § 51.166) of a permit application of a source that may affect visibility the State must notify all affected Federal Land Managers within 30 days of such advance notification, and

(3) Consideration of any analysis performed by the Federal Land Manager, provided within 30 days of the notification and analysis required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, that such proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Federal Class I area. Where the State finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the State that an adverse impact will result in the Federal Class I area, the State must, in the notice of public hearing, either explain its decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained.

(b) The plan shall also provide for the review of any new major stationary source or major modification:

(1) That may have an impact on any integral vista of a mandatory Class I Federal area listed in § 51.304(b), or

(2) That proposes to locate in an area classified as nonattainment under section 107(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act that may have an impact on visibility in any mandatory Class I Federal area.

(c) Review of any major stationary source or major modification under paragraph (b) of this section, shall be conducted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and § 51.166(o), (p)(1) through (2), and (q). In conducting such reviews the State must ensure that the source's emissions will be consistent with making reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal referred to in § 51.300(a). The State may take into account the costs of compliance, the time necessary for compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, and the useful life of the source.

(d) The State may require monitoring of visibility in any Federal Class I area near the proposed new stationary source or major modification for such purposes and by such means as the State deems necessary and appropriate.
