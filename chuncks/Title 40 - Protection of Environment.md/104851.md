####### § 1090.1390 Requirement for Automated Detergent Blending Equipment Calibration.

(a) An automated detergent blending facility must calibrate their automated detergent blending equipment once in each calendar half-year, with the acceptable calibrations being no less than 120 days apart.

(b) Equipment recalibration is also required each time the detergent package is changed, unless written documentation indicates that the new detergent package has the same viscosity as the previous detergent package. Calibrating after changing the detergent package may be used to satisfy the semiannual recalibration requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the calibrations occur in the appropriate calendar half-year and are no less than 120 days apart.
