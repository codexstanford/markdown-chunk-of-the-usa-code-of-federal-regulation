##### Subpart H - Averaging, Banking, and Trading for Certification
###### § 1039.710 How do I average emission credits?

(a) Averaging is the exchange of emission credits among your engine families. You may average emission credits only within the same averaging set.

(b) You may certify one or more engine families to an FEL above the applicable standard, subject to the FEL caps and other provisions in subpart B of this part, if you show in your application for certification that your projected balance of all emission-credit transactions in that model year is greater than or equal to zero.

(c) If you certify an engine family to an FEL that exceeds the otherwise applicable standard, you must obtain enough emission credits to offset the engine family's deficit by the due date for the final report required in § 1039.730. The emission credits used to address the deficit may come from your other engine families that generate emission credits in the same model year, from emission credits you have banked from previous model years, or from emission credits generated in the same or previous model years that you obtained through trading.
