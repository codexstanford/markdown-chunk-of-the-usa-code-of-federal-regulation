###### § 201.11 Standard for locomotive operation under stationary conditions.

(a) Commencing December 31, 1976, no carrier subject to this regulation shall operate any locomotive to which this regulation is applicable, and of which manufacture is completed on or before December 31, 1979, which produces A-weighted sound levels in excess of 93 dB at any throttle setting except idle, when operated singly and when connected to a load cell, or in excess of 73 dB at idle when operated singly, and when measured in accordance with the criteria specified in Subpart C of this part with slow meter response at a point 30 meters (100 feet) from the geometric center of the locomotive along a line that is both perpendicular to the centerline of the track and originates at the locomotive geometric center.

(b) No carrier subject to this regulation shall operate any locomotive to which this regulation is applicable, and of which manufacture is completed after December 31, 1979, which produces A-weighted sound levels in excess of 87 dB at any throttle setting except idle, when operated singly and when connected to a load cell, or in excess of 70 dB at idle when operated singly, and when measured in accordance with the criteria specified in Subpart C of this part with slow meter response at a point 30 meters (100 feet) from the geometric center of the locomotive along a line that is both perpendicular to the centerline of the track and originates at the locomotive geometric center.

(c) Commencing January 15, 1984, no carrier subject to this regulation may operate any switcher locomotive to which this regulation is applicable, and of which manufacture is completed on or before December 31, 1979, which produces A-weighted sound levels in excess of 87 dB at any throttle setting except idle, when operated singly and when connected to a load cell, or in excess of 70 dB at idle, and when measured in accordance with the criteria specified in Subpart C of this part with slow meter response at a point 30 meters (100 feet) from the geometric center of the locomotive along a line that is both perpendicular to the centerline of the track and originates at the locomotive geometric center. All switcher locomotives that operate in a particular railroad facility are deemed to be in compliance with this standard if the A-weighted sound level from stationary switcher locomotives, singly or in combination with other stationary locomotives, does not exceed 65 dB when measured with fast meter response at any receiving property measurement location near that particular railyard facility and when measured in accordance wtih Subpart C of this regulation.
