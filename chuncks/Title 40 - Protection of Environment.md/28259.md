###### § 63.821 Designation of affected sources.

(a) The affected sources subject to this subpart are:

(1) All of the publication rotogravure presses and all related equipment, including proof presses, cylinder and parts cleaners, ink and solvent mixing and storage equipment, and solvent recovery equipment at a facility.

(2) All of the product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing presses at a facility plus any other equipment at that facility which the owner or operator chooses to include in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, except

(i) Proof presses, unless the owner or operator chooses to include proof presses in the affected source in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

(ii) Any product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic press which is used primarily for coating, laminating, or other operations which the owner or operator chooses to exclude, provided that

(A) the sum of the total mass of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, thinners, reducers, and other materials applied by the press using product and packaging rotogravure print stations and the total mass of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, thinners, reducers, and other materials applied by the press using wide-web flexographic print stations in each month never exceeds 5 percent of the total mass of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, thinners, reducers, and other materials applied by the press in that month, including all inboard and outboard stations; and

(B) The owner or operator maintains records as required in § 63.829(f).

(3) The owner or operator of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may elect to include in that affected source stand-alone equipment subject to the following provisions:

(i) Stand-alone equipment meeting any of the criteria specified in this subparagraph is eligible for inclusion:

(A) The stand-alone equipment and one or more product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic presses are used to apply solids-containing materials to the same web or substrate; or

(B) The stand-alone equipment and one or more product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic presses apply a common solids-containing material; or

(C) A common control device is used to control organic HAP emissions from the stand-alone equipment and from one or more product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing presses;

(ii) All eligible stand-alone equipment located at the facility is included in the affected source; and

(iii) No product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic presses are excluded from the affected source under the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

(4) The owner or operator of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may elect to include in that affected source narrow-web flexographic presses subject to the following provisions:

(i) Each narrow-web flexographic press meeting any of the criteria specified in this subparagraph is eligible for inclusion:

(A) The narrow-web flexographic press and one or more product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic presses are used to apply solids containing material to the same web or substrate; or

(B) The narrow-web flexographic press and one or more product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic presses apply a common solids-containing material; or

(C) A common control device is used to control organic HAP emissions from the narrow-web flexographic press and from one or more product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic presses; and

(ii) All eligible narrow-web flexographic presses located at the facility are included in the affected source.

(5) The owner or operator of an affected source, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, may elect to include in that affected source rotogravure proof presses or flexographic proof presses subject to the following provisions:

(i) Each proof press meeting any of the criteria specified in this subparagraph is eligible for inclusion.

(A) The proof press and one or more product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic presses apply a common solids-containing material; or

(B) A common control device is used to control organic HAP emissions from the proof press and from one or more product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic presses; and

(ii) All eligible proof presses located at the facility are included in the affected source.

(6) Affiliated operations such as mixing or dissolving of ink or coating ingredients prior to application; ink or coating mixing for viscosity adjustment, color tint or additive blending, or pH adjustment; cleaning of ink or coating lines and line parts; handling and storage of inks, coatings, and solvents; and conveyance and treatment of wastewater are part of the printing and publishing industry source category, but are not part of the product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source.

(7) Other presses are part of the printing and publishing industry source category, but are not part of the publication rotogravure affected source or the product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source and are, therefore, exempt from the requirements of this subpart except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(8) Narrow web-flexographic presses are part of the printing and publishing industry source category, but are not part of the publication rotogravure affected source or the product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source and are, therefore, exempt from the requirements of this subpart except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section.

(b) Each product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source at a facility that is a major source of HAP, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2, that complies with the criteria of paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) on and after the applicable compliance date as specified in § 63.826 of this subpart is subject only to the requirements of §§ 63.829(e) and 63.830(b)(1) of this subpart.

(1) The owner or operator of the affected source applies no more than 500 kilograms (kg) per month, for every month, of inks, coatings, varnishes, adhesives, primers, solvents, thinners, reducers, and other materials on product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing presses, or

(2) The owner or operator of the affected source applies no more than 400 kg per month, for every month, of organic HAP on product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing presses.

(c) Each product and packaging rotogravure or wide-web flexographic printing affected source at a facility that is a major source of HAP, as defined in 40 CFR 63.2, that complies with neither the criterion of paragraph (b)(1) nor (b)(2) of this section in any month after the applicable compliance date as specified in § 63.826 of this subpart is, starting with that month, subject to all relevant requirements of this subpart and is no longer eligible to use the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, even if in subsequent months the affected source does comply with the criteria of paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.
