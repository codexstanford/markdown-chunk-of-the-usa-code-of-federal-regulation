###### § 63.304 Standards for compliance date extension.

(a) An owner or operator of an existing coke oven battery (including a cold-idle coke oven battery), a padup rebuild, or a brownfield coke oven battery, may elect an extension of the compliance date for emission limits to be promulgated pursuant to section 112(f) of the Act in accordance with section 112(i)(8). To receive an extension of the compliance date from January 1, 2003, until January 1, 2020, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator as described in § 63.311(c) that the battery will comply with the emission limitations and requirements in this section in lieu of the applicable emission limitations in § 63.302 or 63.303.

(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(7) of this section and in § 63.305, on and after the dates specified in this paragraph, no owner or operator shall cause to be discharged or allow to be discharged to the atmosphere coke oven emissions from a by-product coke oven battery that exceed any of the following emission limitations:

(1) On and after November 15, 1993;

(i) 7.0 percent leaking coke oven doors, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1);

(ii) 0.83 percent leaking topside port lids, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1);

(iii) 4.2 percent leaking offtake system(s), as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1); and

(iv) 12 seconds of visible emissions per charge, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(2).

(2) On and after January 1, 1998;

(i) For coke oven doors:

(A) 4.3 percent leaking coke oven doors for each tall by-product coke oven battery and for each by-product coke oven battery owned or operated by a foundry coke producer, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1); and

(B) 3.8 percent leaking coke oven doors on each by-product coke oven battery not subject to the emission limitation in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1);

(ii) 0.4 percent leaking topside port lids, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1);

(iii) 2.5 percent leaking offtake system(s), as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1); and

(iv) 12 seconds of visible emissions per charge, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(2).

(3) On and after January 1, 2010, unless the Administrator promulgates more stringent limits pursuant to section 112(i)(8)(C) of the Act;

(i) 4.0 percent leaking coke oven doors on each tall by-product coke oven battery and for each by-product coke oven battery owned or operated by a foundry coke producer, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1); and

(ii) 3.3 percent leaking coke oven doors for each by-product coke oven battery not subject to the emission limitation in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1).

(4) No owner or operator shall cause to be discharged or allow to be discharged to the atmosphere coke oven emissions from a brownfield or padup rebuild by-product coke oven battery, other than those specified in paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section, that exceed any of the following emission limitations:

(i) For coke oven doors;

(A) 4.0 percent leaking coke oven doors for each tall by-product coke oven battery, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1); and

(B) 3.3 percent leaking coke oven doors on each short by-product coke oven battery, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1);

(ii) 0.4 percent leaking topside port lids, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1);

(iii) 2.5 percent leaking offtake system(s), as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(1); and

(iv) 12 seconds of visible emissions per charge, as determined by the procedures in § 63.309(d)(2).

(v) The requirements of paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall not apply and the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3) of this section do apply to the following brownfield or padup rebuild coke oven batteries:

(A) Bethlehem Steel-Burns Harbor, Battery No. 2;

(B) National Steel-Great Lakes, Battery No. 4; and

(C) Koppers-Woodward, Battery No. 3.

(vi) To retain the exclusion provided in paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section, a coke oven battery specified in paragraph (b)(4)(v) of this section shall commence construction not later than July 1, 1996, or 1 year after obtaining a construction permit, whichever is earlier.

(5) The owner or operator of a cold-idle coke oven battery that shut down on or after November 15, 1990, shall comply with the following emission limitations:

(i) For a brownfield coke oven battery or a padup rebuild coke oven battery, coke oven emissions shall not exceed the emission limitations in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and

(ii) For a cold-idle battery other than a brownfield or padup rebuild coke oven battery, coke oven emissions shall not exceed the emission limitations in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.

(6) The owner or operator of a cold-idle coke oven battery that shut down prior to November 15, 1990, shall submit a written request to the Administrator to include the battery in the design capacity of a coke plant as of November 15, 1990. A copy of the request shall also be sent to Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. The Administrator will review and approve or disapprove a request according to the following procedures:

(i) Requests will be reviewed for completeness in the order received. A complete request shall include:

(A) Battery identification;

(B) Design information, including the design capacity and number and size of ovens; and

(C) A brief description of the owner or operator's plans for the cold-idle battery, including a statement whether construction of a padup rebuild or a brownfield coke oven battery is contemplated.

(ii) A complete request shall be approved if the design capacity of the battery and the design capacity of all previous approvals does not exceed the capacity limit in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.

(iii) The total nationwide coke capacity of coke oven batteries that receive approval under paragraph (b)(6) of this section shall not exceed 2.7 million Mg/yr (3.0 million ton/yr).

(iv) If a construction permit is required, an approval shall lapse if a construction permit is not issued within 3 years of the approval date, or if the construction permit lapses.

(v) If a construction permit is not required, an approval will lapse if the battery is not restarted within 2 years of the approval date.

(c) On and after November 15, 1993, no owner or operator shall cause to be discharged or allow to be discharged to the atmosphere coke oven emissions from an existing nonrecovery coke oven battery that exceed any of the emission limitations or requirements in § 63.303(a).

(d) Each owner or operator of an existing coke oven battery qualifying for a compliance date extension pursuant to this section shall make available, no later than January 1, 2000, to the surrounding communities the results of any risk assessment performed by the Administrator to determine the appropriate level of any emission standard established by the Administrator according to section 112(f) of the Act.
