###### § 63.446 Standards for kraft pulping process condensates.

(a) The requirements of this section apply to owners or operators of kraft processes subject to the requirements of this subpart.

(b) The pulping process condensates from the following equipment systems shall be treated to meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section:

(1) Each digester system;

(2) Each turpentine recovery system;

(3) Each evaporator system condensate from:

(i) The vapors from each stage where weak liquor is introduced (feed stages); and

(ii) Each evaporator vacuum system for each stage where weak liquor is introduced (feed stages).

(4) Each HVLC collection system; and

(5) Each LVHC collection system.

(c) One of the following combinations of HAP-containing pulping process condensates generated, produced, or associated with the equipment systems listed in paragraph (b) of this section shall be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section:

(1) All pulping process condensates from the equipment systems specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section.

(2) The combined pulping process condensates from the equipment systems specified in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section, plus pulping process condensate stream(s) that in total contain at least 65 percent of the total HAP mass from the pulping process condensates from equipment systems listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section.

(3) The pulping process condensates from equipment systems listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section that in total contain a total HAP mass of 3.6 kilograms or more of total HAP per megagram (7.2 pounds per ton) of ODP for mills that do not perform bleaching or 5.5 kilograms or more of total HAP per megagram (11.1 pounds per ton) of ODP for mills that perform bleaching.

(d) The pulping process condensates from the equipment systems listed in paragraph (b) of this section shall be conveyed in a closed collection system that is designed and operated to meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

(1) Each closed collection system shall meet the individual drain system requirements specified in §§ 63.960, 63.961, and 63.962 of subpart RR of this part, except for closed vent systems and control devices shall be designed and operated in accordance with §§ 63.443(d) and 63.450, instead of in accordance with § 63.693 as specified in § 63.962 (a)(3)(ii), (b)(3)(ii)(A), and (b)(5)(iii); and

(2) If a condensate tank is used in the closed collection system, the tank shall meet the following requirements:

(i) The fixed roof and all openings (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports, gauge wells) shall be designed and operated with no detectable leaks as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 parts per million above background, and vented into a closed-vent system that meets the requirements in § 63.450 and routed to a control device that meets the requirements in § 63.443(d); and

(ii) Each opening shall be maintained in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a lid that is gasketed and latched) at all times that the tank contains pulping process condensates or any HAP removed from a pulping process condensate stream except when it is necessary to use the opening for sampling, removal, or for equipment inspection, maintenance, or repair.

(e) Each pulping process condensate from the equipment systems listed in paragraph (b) of this section shall be treated according to one of the following options:

(1) Recycle the pulping process condensate to an equipment system specified in § 63.443(a) meeting the requirements specified in § 63.443(c) and (d); or

(2) Discharge the pulping process condensate below the liquid surface of a biological treatment system and treat the pulping process condensates to meet the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(3), (4), or (5) of this section, and total HAP shall be measured as specified in § 63.457(g); or

(3) Treat the pulping process condensates to reduce or destroy the total HAPs by at least 92 percent or more by weight; or

(4) At mills that do not perform bleaching, treat the pulping process condensates to remove 3.3 kilograms or more of total HAP per megagram (6.6 pounds per ton) of ODP, or achieve a total HAP concentration of 210 parts per million or less by weight at the outlet of the control device; or

(5) At mills that perform bleaching, treat the pulping process condensates to remove 5.1 kilograms or more of total HAP per megagram (10.2 pounds per ton) of ODP, or achieve a total HAP concentration of 330 parts per million or less by weight at the outlet of the control device.

(f) Each HAP removed from a pulping process condensate stream during treatment and handling under paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, except for those treated according to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, shall be controlled as specified in § 63.443(c) and (d).

(g) For each control device (e.g., steam stripper system or other equipment serving the same function) used to treat pulping process condensates to comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(3) through (5) of this section, periods of excess emissions reported under § 63.455 shall not be a violation of paragraphs (d), (e)(3) through (5), and (f) of this section provided that the time of excess emissions divided by the total process operating time in a semi-annual reporting period does not exceed 10 percent. The 10 percent excess emissions allowance does not apply to treatment of pulping process condensates according to paragraph (e)(2) of this section (e.g., the biological wastewater treatment system used to treat multiple (primarily non-condensate) wastewater streams to comply with the Clean Water Act).

(h) Each owner or operator of a new or existing affected source subject to the requirements of this section shall evaluate all new or modified pulping process condensates or changes in the annual bleached or non-bleached ODP used to comply with paragraph (i) of this section, to determine if they meet the applicable requirements of this section.

(i) For the purposes of meeting the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) or paragraph (e)(4) or (5) of this section at mills producing both bleached and unbleached pulp products, owners and operators may meet a prorated mass standard that is calculated by prorating the applicable mass standards (kilograms of total HAP per megagram of ODP) for bleached and unbleached mills specified in paragraph (c)(2) or (3) or paragraph (e)(4) or (5) of this section by the ratio of annual megagrams of bleached and unbleached ODP.
