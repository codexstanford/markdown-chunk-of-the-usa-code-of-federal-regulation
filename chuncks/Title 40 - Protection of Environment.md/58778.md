## Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency
### Subchapter E - Pesticide Programs
#### PART 158 - DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR PESTICIDES
##### Subpart R - Product Performance for Products Claiming Effectiveness Against Invertebrate Pests
###### § 158.1707 Data requirement modifications.

The data requirements (including the performance standards associated with the data requirements) specified in this subpart as applicable to a category of products will not always be appropriate for every product in that category. Data requirements may, on a case-by-case basis, be modified by EPA in response to requests for novel technologies or products that have unusual physical, chemical, or biological properties or atypical use patterns which would make a particular data requirement, or data performance standard, inappropriate. Requests for such data requirement modifications must be submitted in the same manner as waiver requests submitted under 40 CFR 158.45. EPA will respond in writing to those requests. The Agency may grant the request if it finds such modifications are appropriate for the pesticide in question, and will ensure that sufficient data are available to make the determinations required by the applicable statutory standards.
