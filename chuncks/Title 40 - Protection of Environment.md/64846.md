###### § 255.21 Local consultation on boundaries.

Any chief executive of a general purpose government within the State may comment on the Governor's recommendation concerning the boundaries.

(a) The purposes of these comments are to assure that the experience of local agencies is used to fullest advantage in boundary decisions, that incompatible institutional arrangements are not forced, and that significant local considerations are not overlooked.

(b) When the objectives of the Act concerning local consultation can be met by an equivalent or existing process established under State administrative procedures acts or other State procedural guidance, the Governor may request that the EPA accept that process in fulfillment of the grant eligibility criteria under section 4007 of the Act.
