###### § 52.1126 Control strategy: Sulfur oxides.

(a) The revisions to the control strategy resulting from the modification to the emission limitations applicable to the sources listed below or resulting from the change in the compliance date for such sources with the applicable emission limitation is hereby approved. All regulations cited are air pollution control regulations of the State, unless otherwise noted. (See § 52.1125 for compliance schedule approvals and disapprovals pertaining to one or more of the sources listed below.)

(b)(1) Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.05(1) (formerly Regulation 5.1) for the Pioneer Valley Air Pollution Control District, which allows a relaxation of sulfur in fuel limitations under certain conditions, is approved for the following sources. All other sources remain subject to the previously approved requirements of Regulation 7.05(1) which stipulate that sources are required to burn residual fuel oil having a sulfur content not in excess of 0.55 pounds per million Btu heat release potential (approximately equivalent to 1 percent sulfur content.)

(2) Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.05(1)(e)(3) for Pioneer Valley, as submitted on March 2, 1979, and May 5, 1981, which allows sources in Hampshire and Franklin Counties rated at less than 100 million Btu per hour heat input capacity to burn fuel oil having a sulfur content of not more than 1.21 pounds per million Btu heat release potential (approximately equivalent to 2.2% sulfur content) is approved for all such sources with the exception of:

(c) Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.05(1) (formerly Regulation 5.1) which allows a relaxation of sulfur in fuel limitations for the Central Massachusetts Air Pollution Control District, except in the City of Worcester, is approved for the following sources. All other sources remain subject to the previously approved requirements of Regulation 7.05(1) which stipulate that sources are required to burn residual fuel oil having a sulfur content not in excess of 0.55 pounds per million BTU heat release potential (approximately equivalent to 1 percent sulfur content fuel oil).

(d) Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.05(1) (formerly Regulation 5.1) for the Southeastern Massachusetts Air Pollution Control District, which allows a relaxation of sulfur in fuel limitations under certain conditions is approved for the following sources. All other sources remain subject to the previously approved requirements of Regulation 7.05(1) which stipulate that sources are required to burn residual fuel oil having a sulfur content not in excess of 0.55 pounds per million Btu heat release potential (approximately equivalent to 1 percent sulfur content.)

(e) Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.05(1) (formerly Regulation 5.1) for the Merrimack Valley Air Pollution Control District, excluding the City of Lawrence and the towns of Andover, Methuen, and North Andover, which allows a relaxation of sulfur in fuel limitations under certain conditions, is approved for the following sources. All other sources remain subject to the previously approved requirements of Regulation 7.05(1) which stipulates that sources are required to burn residual fuel oil having a sulfur content not in excess of 0.55 pounds per million Btu heat release potential (approximately equivalent to 1 percent sulfur content).

(f) Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.05(1) (formerly Regulation 5.1) for the Metropolitan Boston Air Pollution Control District, which allows a relaxation of sulfur in fuel limitations under certain conditions, is approved for the following sources. All other sources remain subject to the previously approved requirements of Regulation 7.05(1) which stipulate that sources in Arlington, Belmont, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Newton, Somerville, Waltham, and Watertown (the Boston Core Area) are limited to burn fuel with a sulfur content not in excess of 0.28 pounds per million Btu heat release potential (approximately 0.5% sulfur content residual oil; sources in the remaining APCD are limited to burn fuel with a sulfur content not in excess of 0.55 pounds per million Btu heat release potential (approximately 1% sulfur content residual oil).
