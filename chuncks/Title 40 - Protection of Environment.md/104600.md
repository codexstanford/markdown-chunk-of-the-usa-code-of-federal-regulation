##### Subpart F - Transmix and Pipeline Interface Provisions
###### § 1090.520 Handling practices for pipeline interface that is not transmix.

(a) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, a pipeline operator may cut pipeline interface from two batches of gasoline subject to EPA standards that are shipped adjacent to each other by pipeline into either or both these batches of gasoline provided that this action does not cause or contribute to a violation of the standards in this part.

(b) During the summer season, a pipeline operator must not cut pipeline interface from two batches of gasoline subject to different RVP standards that are shipped adjacent to each other by pipeline into the gasoline batch that is subject to the more stringent RVP standard. For example, during the summer season, a pipeline operator must not cut pipeline interface from a batch of RFG shipped adjacent to a batch of conventional gasoline into the batch of RFG.
