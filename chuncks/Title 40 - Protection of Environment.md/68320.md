(1) The RAP application, and any supporting data furnished by the applicant;

(2) The draft RAP or notice of intent to deny;

(3) The statement of basis and all documents cited therein (material readily available at the issuing Regional office or published material that is generally available need not be physically included with the rest of the record, as long as it is specifically referred to in the statement of basis); and

(4) Any other documents that support the decision to approve or deny the RAP; and

(c) Make information contained in the administrative record available for review by the public upon request.
