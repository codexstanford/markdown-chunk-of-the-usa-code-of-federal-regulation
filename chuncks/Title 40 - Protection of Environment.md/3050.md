(a) If EPA awards you a fellowship on the basis of a nomination by your current or prospective state, local or Tribal government employer, by accepting the fellowship agreement you agree to remain in the employment of the state, local, or Tribal employer for twice the period of the fellowship. If you fail to meet this obligation, EPA may, after consultation with your employer or prospective employer, require you to repay the amount of the fellowship.

(b) You must submit a copy of your transcript to the EPA project officer after the completion of each year of the fellowship, if required by the fellowship agreement. You must also submit copies of any publications and other products from the research, if required.

(c) EPA may require you to provide various performance reports under your fellowship, but we will not require reports more frequently than quarterly. At the end of the fellowship, you must submit a final report and other documentation, if required in the fellowship agreement.
