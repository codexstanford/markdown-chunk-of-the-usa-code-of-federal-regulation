##### Appendix D to Part 403 - Selected Industrial Subcategories Considered Dilute for Purposes of the Combined Wastestream Formula

The following industrial subcategories are considered to have dilute wastestreams for purposes of the combined wastestream formula. They either were or could have been excluded from categorical pretreatment standards pursuant to paragraph 8 of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., et al. v. Costle Consent Decree for one or more of the following four reasons: (1) The pollutants of concern are not detectable in the effluent from the industrial user (paragraph 8(a)(iii)); (2) the pollutants of concern are present only in trace amounts and are neither causing nor likely to cause toxic effects (paragraph 8(a)(iii)); (3) the pollutants of concern are present in amounts too small to be effectively reduced by technologies known to the Administrator (paragraph 8(a)(iii)); or (4) the wastestream contains only pollutants which are compatible with the POTW (paragraph 8(b)(i)). In some instances, different rationales were given for exclusion under paragraph 8. However, EPA has reviewed these subcategories and has determined that exclusion could have occurred due to one of the four reasons listed above.

This list is complete as of October 9, 1986. It will be updated periodically for the convenience of the reader.
