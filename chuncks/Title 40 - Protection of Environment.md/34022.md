###### What This Subpart Covers
####### § 63.3082 What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?

(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, and existing affected source.

(b) The affected source is the collection of all of the items listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section that are used for surface coating of new automobile or new light-duty truck bodies, or body parts for new automobiles or new light-duty trucks:

(1) All coating operations as defined in § 63.3176.

(2) All storage containers and mixing vessels in which coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials are stored or mixed.

(3) All manual and automated equipment and containers used for conveying coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials.

(4) All storage containers and all manual and automated equipment and containers used for conveying waste materials generated by a coating operation.

(c) In addition, you may choose to include in your affected source, and thereby make subject to the requirements of this subpart, any coating operations, as defined in § 63.3176, which would otherwise be subject to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products (subpart MMMM of this part) or the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Surface Coating of Plastic Parts and Products (subpart PPPP of this part) which apply coatings to new other motor vehicle bodies or body parts for new other motor vehicles, parts intended for use in new automobiles, new light-duty trucks, or new other motor vehicles, or aftermarket repair or replacement parts for automobiles, light-duty trucks, or other motor vehicles.

(d) For all coating operations which you choose to add to your affected source pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section:

(1) All associated storage containers and mixing vessels in which coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials are stored or mixed; manual and automated equipment and containers used for conveying coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials; and storage containers and manual and automated equipment and containers used for conveying waste materials are also included in your affected source and are subject to the requirements of this subpart.

(2) All cleaning and purging of equipment associated with the added surface coating operations is subject to the requirements of this subpart.

(3) You must identify and describe all additions to the affected source made pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section in the initial notification required in § 63.3110(b).

(e) An affected source is a new affected source if:

(1) You commenced its construction after December 24, 2002; and

(2) The construction is of a completely new automobile and light-duty truck assembly plant, automobile and light-duty truck paint shop, automobile and light-duty truck topcoat operation, other motor vehicle assembly plant, other motor vehicle paint shop, or other motor vehicle topcoat operation where previously no automobile and light-duty truck assembly plant, automobile and light-duty truck assembly paint shop, or automobile and light-duty truck assembly topcoat operation had existed; and

(i) No other motor vehicle assembly plant, other motor vehicle paint shop, or other motor vehicle topcoat operation had existed previously; or

(ii) No previously existing other motor vehicle assembly plant, other motor vehicle paint shop, or other motor vehicle topcoat operation is subject to this subpart; or

(iii) If the facility was previously not a major source for HAP, no previously existing other motor vehicle assembly plant, other motor vehicle paint shop, or other motor vehicle topcoat operation is made part of the affected source under this subpart.

(f) An affected source is reconstructed if its paint shop undergoes replacement of components to such an extent that:

(1) The fixed capital cost of the new components exceeded 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to construct a new paint shop; and

(2) It was technologically and economically feasible for the reconstructed source to meet the relevant standards established by the Administrator pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA).

(g) An affected source is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.
