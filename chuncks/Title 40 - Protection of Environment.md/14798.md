###### § 52.2085 Stack height review.

The State of Rhode Island has declared to the satisfaction of EPA that no existing emission limitations have been affected by stack height credits greater than good engineering practice or any other prohibited dispersion technique as defined in EPA's stack height regulations, as revised on July 8, 1985. Such declarations were submitted to EPA on March 27, 1986. The State has further declared, in letters from Thomas D. Getz, dated October 15, 1985 and March 27, 1986, that "[R]hode Island will use the 8 July 1985 revised height regulations in administering section 9.18 of its new source review regulations." Thus, Rhode Island has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.
