####### § 51.1009 Moderate area attainment plan control strategy requirements.

(a) The state shall identify, adopt, and implement control measures, including control technologies, on sources of direct PMemissions and sources of emissions of PMplan precursors located in any Moderate PMnonattainment area or portion thereof located within the state consistent with the following:

(1) The state shall identify all sources of direct PMemissions and all sources of emissions of PMprecursors in the nonattainment area in accordance with the emissions inventory requirements of § 51.1008(a).

(2) The state shall identify all potential control measures to reduce emissions from all sources of direct PMemissions and all sources of emissions of PMplan precursors in the nonattainment area identified under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(i) The state is not required to identify and evaluate potential control measures to reduce emissions of a particular PMprecursor from any existing sources if the state has submitted a comprehensive precursor demonstration approved by the EPA pursuant to § 51.1006, except where the EPA requires such information as necessary to evaluate the comprehensive precursor demonstration pursuant to § 51.1006(a)(1)(ii).

(ii) The state is not required to identify and evaluate potential control measures to reduce emissions of a particular PMprecursor from any existing major stationary sources if the state has submitted a major stationary source precursor demonstration approved by the EPA pursuant to § 51.1006, except where the EPA requires such information as necessary to evaluate the major stationary source precursor demonstration pursuant to § 51.1006(a)(1)(ii).

(3) For any potential control measure identified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the state may make a demonstration that such measure is not technologically or economically feasible to implement in whole or in part by the end of the sixth calendar year following the effective date of designation of the area, and the state may eliminate such whole or partial measure from further consideration under this paragraph.

(i) For purposes of evaluating the technological feasibility of a potential control measure, the state may consider factors including but not limited to a source's processes and operating procedures, raw materials, physical plant layout, and potential environmental impacts such as increased water pollution, waste disposal, and energy requirements.

(ii) For purposes of evaluating the economic feasibility of a potential control measure, the state may consider factors including but not limited to capital costs, operating and maintenance costs, and cost effectiveness of the measure.

(iii) The state must submit to the EPA as part of its Moderate area attainment plan a detailed written justification for eliminating from further consideration any potential control measure identified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section on the basis of technological or economic infeasibility.

(4) The state shall use air quality modeling that meets the requirements of § 51.1011(a) and that accounts for emissions reductions estimated due to all technologically and economically feasible control measures identified for sources of direct PMemissions and sources of emissions of PMplan precursors in the Moderate PMnonattainment area to demonstrate that the area can attain the applicable PMNAAQS as expeditiously as practicable but no later than the end of the sixth year following the effective date of designation of the area. The state may use air quality modeling to demonstrate that the Moderate PMnonattainment area cannot practicably attain the applicable PMNAAQS by such date.

(i) If the state demonstrates through air quality modeling that the area can attain the applicable PMNAAQS by the end of the sixth calendar year following the effective date of designation of the area, the state shall adopt and implement all technologically and economically feasible control measures identified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that are necessary to bring the area into attainment by such date. The state shall also adopt and implement all other technologically and economically feasible measures identified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that, when considered collectively, would advance the attainment date for the area by at least 1 year. If the state demonstrates through this analysis that control measures for reducing emissions of a PMprecursor would not be necessary for attainment as expeditiously as practicable or to advance the attainment date, then the state would not be required to include control measures for the precursor in the Moderate area attainment plan, nor be required to address the precursor in the RFP plan, quantitative milestones and associated reports, and contingency measures.

(A) Any control measure identified for adoption and implementation under this paragraph that can be implemented in whole or in part by 4 years after the effective date of designation of the Moderate PMnonattainment area shall be considered RACM for the area. Any such control measure that is also a control technology shall be considered RACT for the area.

(B) Any control measure identified for adoption and implementation under this paragraph that can only be implemented in whole or in part during the period beginning 4 years after the effective date of designation of the Moderate PMnonattainment area and the applicable attainment date for the area shall be considered an additional reasonable measure for the area.

(ii) If the state demonstrates that the area cannot practicably attain the applicable PMNAAQS by the end of the sixth calendar year following the effective date of designation of the area, the state shall adopt all technologically and economically feasible control measures identified under paragraph (a)(3) of this section. This requirement also applies to areas that demonstrate pursuant to section 179B that the plan would be adequate to attain or maintain the standard but for emissions emanating from outside the United States.

(A) Any control measure identified for adoption and implementation under this paragraph that can be implemented in whole or in part by 4 years after the effective date of designation of the Moderate PMnonattainment area shall be considered RACM for the area. Any such control measure that is also a control technology shall be considered RACT for the area.

(B) Any control measure identified for adoption and implementation under this paragraph that can only be implemented in whole or in part during the period beginning 4 years after the effective date of designation of the Moderate PMnonattainment area through the end of the sixth calendar year following the effective date of designation of the area shall be considered an additional reasonable measure for the area.

(b) The state shall adopt control measures, including control technologies, on sources of direct PMemissions and sources of emissions of PMplan precursors located within the state but outside the Moderate PMnonattainment area if adopting such control measures is necessary to provide for attainment of the applicable PMNAAQS in such area.

(c) For new or revised source emissions limitations on sources of direct PMemissions, the state shall establish such emission limitations to apply either to the total of the filterable plus condensable fractions of direct PM, or to filterable PMand condensable PMseparately.
