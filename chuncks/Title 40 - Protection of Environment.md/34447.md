####### § 63.3530 By what date must I conduct the initial compliance demonstration?

You must complete the initial compliance demonstration for the initial compliance period according to the requirements of § 63.3531. The initial compliance period begins on the applicable compliance date specified in § 63.3483 and ends on the last day of the 12th month following the compliance date. If the compliance date occurs on any day other than the first day of a month, then the initial compliance period extends through the end of that month plus the next 12 months. You must determine the mass of organic HAP emissions and volume of coating solids used each month and then calculate a 12-month organic HAP emission rate at the end of the initial 12-month compliance period. The initial compliance demonstration includes the calculations according to § 63.3531 and supporting documentation showing that, during the initial compliance period, the organic HAP emission rate was equal to or less than the applicable emission limit in § 63.3490.
