###### § 60.36e Inspection guidelines.

(a) For approval, a State plan shall require each small HMIWI subject to the emissions limits under § 60.33e(b) and each HMIWI subject to the emissions limits under § 60.33e(a)(2) and (a)(3) to undergo an initial equipment inspection that is at least as protective as the following within 1 year following approval of the State plan:

(1) At a minimum, an inspection shall include the following:

(i) Inspect all burners, pilot assemblies, and pilot sensing devices for proper operation; clean pilot flame sensor, as necessary;

(ii) Ensure proper adjustment of primary and secondary chamber combustion air, and adjust as necessary;

(iii) Inspect hinges and door latches, and lubricate as necessary;

(iv) Inspect dampers, fans, and blowers for proper operation;

(v) Inspect HMIWI door and door gaskets for proper sealing;

(vi) Inspect motors for proper operation;

(vii) Inspect primary chamber refractory lining; clean and repair/replace lining as necessary;

(viii) Inspect incinerator shell for corrosion and/or hot spots;

(ix) Inspect secondary/tertiary chamber and stack, clean as necessary;

(x) Inspect mechanical loader, including limit switches, for proper operation, if applicable;

(xi) Visually inspect waste bed (grates), and repair/seal, as appropriate;

(xii) For the burn cycle that follows the inspection, document that the incinerator is operating properly and make any necessary adjustments;

(xiii) Inspect air pollution control device(s) for proper operation, if applicable;

(xiv) Inspect waste heat boiler systems to ensure proper operation, if applicable;

(xv) Inspect bypass stack components;

(xvi) Ensure proper calibration of thermocouples, sorbent feed systems and any other monitoring equipment; and

(xvii) Generally observe that the equipment is maintained in good operating condition.

(2) Within 10 operating days following an equipment inspection all necessary repairs shall be completed unless the owner or operator obtains written approval from the State agency establishing a date whereby all necessary repairs of the designated facility shall be completed.

(b) For approval, a State plan shall require each small HMIWI subject to the emissions limits under § 60.33e(b) and each HMIWI subject to the emissions limits under § 60.33e(a)(2) and (a)(3) to undergo an equipment inspection annually (no more than 12 months following the previous annual equipment inspection), as outlined in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) For approval, a State plan shall require each small HMIWI subject to the emissions limits under § 60.33e(b)(2) and each HMIWI subject to the emissions limits under § 60.33e(a)(2) and (a)(3) to undergo an initial air pollution control device inspection, as applicable, that is at least as protective as the following within 1 year following approval of the State plan:

(1) At a minimum, an inspection shall include the following:

(i) Inspect air pollution control device(s) for proper operation, if applicable;

(ii) Ensure proper calibration of thermocouples, sorbent feed systems, and any other monitoring equipment; and

(iii) Generally observe that the equipment is maintained in good operating condition.

(2) Within 10 operating days following an air pollution control device inspection, all necessary repairs shall be completed unless the owner or operator obtains written approval from the State agency establishing a date whereby all necessary repairs of the designated facility shall be completed.

(d) For approval, a State plan shall require each small HMIWI subject to the emissions limits under § 60.33e(b)(2) and each HMIWI subject to the emissions limits under § 60.33e(a)(2) and (a)(3) to undergo an air pollution control device inspection, as applicable, annually (no more than 12 months following the previous annual air pollution control device inspection), as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section.
