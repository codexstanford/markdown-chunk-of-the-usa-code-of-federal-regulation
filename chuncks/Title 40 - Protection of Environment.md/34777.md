###### Table 3 to Subpart MMMM of Part 63 - Default Organic HAP Mass Fraction for Solvents and Solvent Blends

You may use the mass fraction values in the following table for solvent blends for which you do not have test data or manufacturer's formulation data and which match either the solvent blend name or the chemical abstract series (CAS) number. If a solvent blend matches both the name and CAS number for an entry, that entry's organic HAP mass fraction must be used for that solvent blend. Otherwise, use the organic HAP mass fraction for the entry matching either the solvent blend name or CAS number, or use the organic HAP mass fraction from table 4 to this subpart if neither the name or CAS number match.
