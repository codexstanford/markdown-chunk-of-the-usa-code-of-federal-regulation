###### What This Subpart Covers
####### § 63.9782 Am I subject to this subpart?

You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a refractory products manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of, a major source of hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions according to the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(a) A refractory products manufacturing facility is a plant site that manufactures refractory products (refractory bricks, refractory shapes, monolithics, kiln furniture, crucibles, and other materials used for lining furnaces and other high temperature process units), as defined in § 63.9824. Refractory products manufacturing facilities typically process raw material by crushing, grinding, and screening; mixing the processed raw materials with binders and other additives; forming the refractory mix into shapes; and drying and firing the shapes.

(b) A major source of HAP is a plant site that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
