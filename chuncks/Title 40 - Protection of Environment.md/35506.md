####### § 63.4892 What operating limits must I meet?

(a) For any coating operation or group of coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option to demonstrate compliance, you are not required to meet any operating limits.

(b) For any coating operation or group of coating operations for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option to demonstrate compliance, except those for which you use a solvent recovery system and conduct a liquid-liquid material balance according to § 63.4961(j), you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 1 to this subpart. These operating limits apply to the emission capture and control systems on the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you use emission capture and add-on controls to demonstrate compliance. You must establish the operating limits during the performance test according to the requirements in § 63.4966. You must meet the operating limits at all times after you establish them.

(c) If you use an add-on control device other than those listed in Table 1 to this subpart, or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).
