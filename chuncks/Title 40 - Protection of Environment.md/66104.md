#### PART 261 - IDENTIFICATION AND LISTING OF HAZARDOUS WASTE
##### Subpart CC - Air Emission Standards for Tanks and Containers
###### § 261.1084 Standards: tanks.

(a) The provisions of this section apply to the control of air pollutant emissions from tanks for which § 261.1082(b) of this subpart references the use of this section for such air emission control.

(b) The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall control air pollutant emissions from each tank subject to this section in accordance with the following requirements as applicable:

(1) For a tank that manages hazardous secondary material that meets all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall control air pollutant emissions from the tank in accordance with the Tank Level 1 controls specified in paragraph (c) of this section or the Tank Level 2 controls specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(i) The hazardous secondary material in the tank has a maximum organic vapor pressure which is less than the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank's design capacity category as follows:

(A) For a tank design capacity equal to or greater than 151 m, the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank is 5.2 kPa.

(B) For a tank design capacity equal to or greater than 75 mbut less than 151 m, the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank is 27.6 kPa.

(C) For a tank design capacity less than 75 m, the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank is 76.6 kPa.

(ii) The hazardous secondary material in the tank is not heated by the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material to a temperature that is greater than the temperature at which the maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous secondary material is determined for the purpose of complying with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

(2) For a tank that manages hazardous secondary material that does not meet all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall control air pollutant emissions from the tank by using Tank Level 2 controls in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. An example of tanks required to use Tank Level 2 controls is a tank for which the hazardous secondary material in the tank has a maximum organic vapor pressure that is equal to or greater than the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank's design capacity category as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

(c) Remanufacturers or other persons that store or treats the hazardous secondary material controlling air pollutant emissions from a tank using Tank Level 1 controls shall meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section:

(1) The remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats that hazardous secondary material shall determine the maximum organic vapor pressure for a hazardous secondary material to be managed in the tank using Tank Level 1 controls before the first time the hazardous secondary material is placed in the tank. The maximum organic vapor pressure shall be determined using the procedures specified in § 261.1083(c) of this subpart. Thereafter, the remanufacturer or other person that stores or treats the hazardous secondary material shall perform a new determination whenever changes to the hazardous secondary material managed in the tank could potentially cause the maximum organic vapor pressure to increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank design capacity category specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, as applicable to the tank.

(2) The tank shall be equipped with a fixed roof designed to meet the following specifications:
