###### § 1033.825 Refueling requirements.

(a) If your locomotive operates using a volatile fuel, your refueling equipment must be designed and used to minimize the escape of fuel vapors. This means you may not use refueling equipment in a way that renders any refueling emission controls inoperative or reduces their effectiveness.

(b) If your locomotive operates using a gaseous fuel, the hoses used to refuel it may not be designed to be bled or vented to the atmosphere under normal operating conditions.

(c) Failing to fully comply with the requirements of this section is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(b).
