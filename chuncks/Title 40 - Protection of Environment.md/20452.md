####### § 60.2550 What CISWIs must I address in my state plan?

(a) Your state plan must address incineration units that meet all three criteria described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section:

(1) Commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units and ACIs in your state that commenced construction on or before June 4, 2010, or commenced modification or reconstruction after June 4, 2010 but no later than August 7, 2013;

(2) Incineration units that meet the definition of a CISWI as defined in § 60.2875 or an ACI as defined in § 60.2875; and

(3) Incineration units not exempt under § 60.2555.

(b) If the owner or operator of a CISWI or ACI makes changes that meet the definition of modification or reconstruction after August 7, 2013, the CISWI or ACI becomes subject to subpart CCCC of this part and the state plan no longer applies to that unit.

(c) If the owner or operator of a CISWI or ACI makes physical or operational changes to an existing CISWI or ACI primarily to comply with your state plan, subpart CCCC of this part does not apply to that unit. Such changes do not qualify as modifications or reconstructions under subpart CCCC of this part.
