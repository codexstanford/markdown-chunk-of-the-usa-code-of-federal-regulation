###### § 280.106 Local government guarantee.

(a) A local government owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of § 280.93 by obtaining a guarantee that conforms to the requirements of this section. The guarantor must be either the state in which the local government owner or operator is located or a local government having a "substantial governmental relationship" with the owner and operator and issuing the guarantee as an act incident to that relationship. A local government acting as the guarantor must:

(1) Demonstrate that it meets the bond rating test requirement of § 280.104 and deliver a copy of the chief financial officer's letter as contained in § 280.104(d) and (e) to the local government owner or operator; or

(2) Demonstrate that it meets the worksheet test requirements of § 280.105 and deliver a copy of the chief financial officer's letter as contained in § 280.105(c) to the local government owner or operator; or

(3) Demonstrate that it meets the local government fund requirements of § 280.107(a), (b), or (c) and deliver a copy of the chief financial officer's letter as contained in § 280.107 to the local government owner or operator.

(b) If the local government guarantor is unable to demonstrate financial assurance under any of §§ 280.104, 280.105, or 280.107(a), (b), or (c), at the end of the financial reporting year, the guarantor shall send by certified mail, before cancellation or non-renewal of the guarantee, notice to the owner or operator. The guarantee will terminate no less than 120 days after the date the owner or operator receives the notification, as evidenced by the return receipt. The owner or operator must obtain alternative coverage as specified in § 280.114(e).

(c) The guarantee agreement must be worded as specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, depending on which of the following alternative guarantee arrangements is selected:

(1) If, in the default or incapacity of the owner or operator, the guarantor guarantees to fund a standby trust as directed by the Director of the implementing agency, the guarantee shall be worded as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) If, in the default or incapacity of the owner or operator, the guarantor guarantees to make payments as directed by the Director of the implementing agency for taking corrective action or compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage, the guarantee shall be worded as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

(d) If the guarantor is a state, the local government guarantee with standby trust must be worded exactly as follows, except that instructions in brackets are to be replaced with relevant information and the brackets deleted:

If more than one instrument is used to assure different tanks at any one facility, for each tank covered by this instrument, list the tank identification number provided in the notification submitted pursuant to 40 CFR part 280 or the corresponding state requirement, and the name and address of the facility.] This guarantee satisfies 40 CFR part 280, subpart H requirements for assuring funding for [insert: "taking corrective action" and/or "compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by" either "sudden accidental releases" or "nonsudden accidental releases" or "accidental releases"; if coverage is different for different tanks or locations, indicate the type of coverage applicable to each tank or location] arising from operating the above-identified underground storage tank(s) in the amount of [insert dollar amount] per occurrence and [insert dollar amount] annual aggregate.

(3) Guarantor guarantees to [implementing agency] and to any and all third parties that:

In the event that [local government owner or operator] fails to provide alternative coverage within 60 days after receipt of a notice of cancellation of this guarantee and the [Director of the implementing agency] has determined or suspects that a release has occurred at an underground storage tank covered by this guarantee, the guarantor, upon instructions from the [Director] shall fund a standby trust fund in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 280.112, in an amount not to exceed the coverage limits specified above.
