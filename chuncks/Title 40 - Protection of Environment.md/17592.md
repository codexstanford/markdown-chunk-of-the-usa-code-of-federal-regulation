##### Subpart D - Standards of Performance for Fossil-Fuel-Fired Steam Generators
###### § 60.42 Standard for particulate matter (PM).
############# § 60.43 Standard for sulfur dioxide (SO).

(a) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, on and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere from any affected facility any gases that contain SOin excess of:

(1) 340 ng/J heat input (0.80 lb/MMBtu) derived from liquid fossil fuel or liquid fossil fuel and wood residue.

(2) 520 ng/J heat input (1.2 lb/MMBtu) derived from solid fossil fuel or solid fossil fuel and wood residue, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.

(b) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, when different fossil fuels are burned simultaneously in any combination, the applicable standard (in ng/J) shall be determined by proration using the following formula:

(c) Compliance shall be based on the total heat input from all fossil fuels burned, including gaseous fuels.

(d) As an alternate to meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, an owner or operator can petition the Administrator (in writing) to comply with § 60.43Da(i)(3) of subpart Da of this part or comply with § 60.42b(k)(4) of subpart Db of this part, as applicable to the affected source. If the Administrator grants the petition, the source will from then on (unless the unit is modified or reconstructed in the future) have to comply with the requirements in § 60.43Da(i)(3) of subpart Da of this part or § 60.42b(k)(4) of subpart Db of this part, as applicable to the affected source.

(e) Units 1 and 2 (as defined in appendix G of this part) at the Newton Power Station owned or operated by the Central Illinois Public Service Company will be in compliance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section if Unit 1 and Unit 2 individually comply with paragraph (a)(2) of this section or if the combined emission rate from Units 1 and 2 does not exceed 470 ng/J (1.1 lb/MMBtu) combined heat input to Units 1 and 2.
