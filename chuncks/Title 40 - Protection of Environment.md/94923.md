###### § 766.28 Expert review of protocols.

EPA will gather a panel of experts in analysis of chemical matrices for HDDs/HDFs to review the protocols for testing submitted to EPA. The panel members will be employees of EPA and/or of other U.S. Government agencies who have had experience in analysis of chemical matrices and/or chemical wastes for HDDs/HDFs. The panel will recommend to the Director, EPA Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, whether the protocol submitted is likely to allow analysis down to the target LOQs, or if not, whether the protocol represents a good faith effort on the part of the tester to achieve the lowest possible LOQs. The final determination to accept or reject the protocol will be made by the Director, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. EPA will review the submitted protocols as rapidly as possible and will complete the review within 90 days after receipt. EPA may require submission of revised protocols. Comments and recommendations will be transmitted to the submitter, and if revisions are required, a final protocol must be submitted to EPA within 90 days after EPA transmits such recommendations.
