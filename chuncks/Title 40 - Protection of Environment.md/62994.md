(b) No request for a national security exemption is required.

(c) For purposes of section 11(d) of the Act, any national security exemption shall be void ab initio with respect to each new product, originally intended to be produced to conform with specifications developed by a national security agency, but distributed in commerce for other uses.

(d) Any manufacturer or person subject to the liabilities of section 11(a) with respect to any product originally intended for a national security agency, but distributed in commerce for use in any State, may be excluded from the application of section 11(a) with respect to such product based upon a showing that such manufacturer:

(2) Made reasonable effort to ensure that such products would not be distributed in commerce for use in any State. Such reasonable efforts would include investigation, prior dealings, contract provisions, etc.
