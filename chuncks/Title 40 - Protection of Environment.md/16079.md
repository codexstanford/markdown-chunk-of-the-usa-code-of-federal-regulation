###### § 57.108 Comparable existing SIP provisions.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an NSO may contain provisions to which the affected smelter is subject under the applicable EPA-approved State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide in lieu of the corresponding provisions which would otherwise be required under this part if the Administrator determines that those SIP provisions are substantially equivalent to the corresponding NSO provisions which would otherwise be required, and if the Administrator determines that the smelter is in substantial compliance with those SIP provisions. For the purposes of this section, provisions to which the affected smelter is subject under the applicable EPA-approved State Implementation Plan are those which became effective before the smelter owner applied for the NSO.
