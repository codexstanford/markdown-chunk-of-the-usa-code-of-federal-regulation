####### Purpose.

(a)The purpose of the Special Review process is to help the Agency determine whether to initiate procedures to cancel, deny, or reclassify registration of a pesticide product because uses of that product may cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, in accordance with sections 3(c)(6) and 6 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The process is intended to ensure that the Agency assesses risks that may be posed by pesticides, and the benefits of use of those pesticides, in an open and responsive manner. The issuance of a Notice of Special Review means that the Agency has determined that one or more uses of a pesticide may pose significant risks and that, following completion of the Special Review process, the Agency expects to initiate formal proceedings seeking to cancel, deny, reclassify, or require modifications to the registration of the product(s) in question unless it has been shown during the Special Review that the Agency's initial determination was erroneous, that the risks can be reduced to acceptable levels without the need for formal proceedings, or that the benefits of the pesticide's use outweigh the risks. Following completion of the Special Review process, a pesticide in question may be returned to the registration process.
