#### PART 228 - CRITERIA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DISPOSAL SITES FOR OCEAN DUMPING
##### § 228.11 Modification in disposal site use.

(a) Modifications in disposal site use which involve the withdrawal of designated disposal sites from use or permanent changes in the total specified quantities or types of wastes permitted to be discharged to a specific disposal site will be made through promulgation of an amendment to the disposal site designation set forth in this part 228 and will be based on the results of the analyses of impact described in § 228.10 or upon changed circumstances concerning use of the site.

(b) Modifications in disposal site use promulgated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall not automatically modify conditions of any outstanding permit issued pursuant to this subchapter H, and provided further that unless the EPA management authority for such site modifies, revokes or suspends such permit or any of the terms or conditions of such permit in accordance with the provisions of § 232.2 based on the results of impact analyses as described in § 228.10 or upon changed circumstances concerning use of the site, such permit will remain in force until its expiration date.

(c) When the EPA management authority determines that activities at a disposal site have placed the site in Impact Category I, the Administrator or the Regional Administrator, as the case may be, shall place such limitations on the use of the site as are necessary to reduce the impacts to acceptable levels.

(d) The determination of the Administrator as to whether to terminate or limit use of a disposal site will be based on the impact of disposal at the site itself and on the Criteria.
