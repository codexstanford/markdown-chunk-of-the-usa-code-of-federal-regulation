###### § 129.6 Adjustment of effluent standard for presence of toxic pollutant in the intake water.

(a) Upon the request of the owner or operator of a facility discharging a pollutant subject to a toxic pollutant effluent standard or prohibition, the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate) shall give credit, and shall adjust the effluent standard(s) in such permit to reflect credit for the toxic pollutant(s) in the owner's or operator's water supply if (1) the source of the owner's or operator's water supply is the same body of water into which the discharge is made and if (2) it is demonstrated to the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate) that the toxic pollutant(s) present in the owner's or operator's intake water will not be removed by any wastewater treatment systems whose design capacity and operation were such as to reduce toxic pollutants to the levels required by the applicable toxic pollutant effluent standards in the absence of the toxic pollutant in the intake water.

(b) Effluent limitations established pursuant to this section shall be calculated on the basis of the amount of section 307(a) toxic pollutant(s) present in the water after any water supply treatment steps have been performed by or for the owner or operator.

(c) Any permit which includes toxic pollutant effluent limitations established pursuant to this section shall also contain conditions requiring the permittee to conduct additional monitoring in the manner and locations determined by the Regional Administrator (or State Director, if appropriate) for those toxic pollutants for which the toxic pollutant effluent standards have been adjusted.
