(a) At the time a State proposes to grant a small system variance to a public water system serving a population of more than 3,300 and fewer than 10,000 persons, the State must submit the proposed small system variance and all supporting information, including public comments received prior to proposal, to the Administrator.

(b) The Administrator must approve or disapprove the small system variance within 90 days of receipt of the proposed small system variance and supporting information. The Administrator must approve the small system variance if it meets each requirement within the Act and this rule.

The State may resubmit the small system variance for review and approval with modifications to address the objections stated by the Administrator.
