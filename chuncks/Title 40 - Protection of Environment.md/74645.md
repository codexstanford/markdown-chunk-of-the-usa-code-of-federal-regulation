###### § 430.54 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of best available technology economically achievable (BAT).

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).

(a)(1) The following effluent limitations apply to all dischargers in the calcium-, magnesium-, or sodium-based sulfite pulp segment:

(2)(i) The following effluent limitations apply to all dischargers in the ammonium-based sulfite pulp segment:

(ii) The following effluent limitations apply to all dischargers in the ammonium-based sulfite pulp segment with respect to each fiber line that uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes, as disclosed by the discharger in its NPDES permit application under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(3) and certified under 40 CFR 122.22:

(3)(i) The following effluent limitations apply to all dischargers in the specialty grade pulp segment:

(ii) The following effluent limitations apply to dischargers in the specialty grade pulp segment with respect to each fiber line that uses exclusively TCF bleaching processes, as disclosed by the discharger in its NPDES permit application under 40 CFR 122.21(g)(3) and certified under 40 CFR 122.22:

(b) The following additional effluent limitations apply to each discharger subject to this section in accordance with the previous subcatgorization scheme unless it certifies to the permitting authority that it is not using these compounds as biocides. Also, for non-continuous dischargers, concentration limitations (mg/l) shall apply. Concentration limitations will only apply to non-continuous dischargers:

(c) Pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(i) and 122.45(h), a discharger must demonstrate compliance with the limitations in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, as applicable, by monitoring for all pollutants (except for AOX and COD) at the point where the wastewater containing those pollutants leaves the bleach plant. The permitting authority may impose effluent limitations and/or monitoring requirements on internal wastestreams for any other pollutants covered in this section as appropriate under 40 CFR 122.44(i) and 122.45(h).
