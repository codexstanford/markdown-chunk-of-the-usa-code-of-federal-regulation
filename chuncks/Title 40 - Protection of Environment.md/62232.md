Lepidopteran pheromones that are naturally occurring compounds, or identical or substantially similar synthetic compounds, designated by an unbranched aliphatic chain (between 9 and 18 carbons) ending in an alcohol, aldehyde or acetate functional group and containing up to 3 double bonds in the aliphatic backbone, are exempt from the requirement of a tolerance in or on all raw agricultural commodities.
