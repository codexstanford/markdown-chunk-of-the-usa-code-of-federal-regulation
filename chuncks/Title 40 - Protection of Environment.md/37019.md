####### § 63.7826 How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations that apply to me?

(a) For each affected source subject to an emission or opacity limit in Table 1 to this subpart, you have demonstrated initial compliance if:

(1) You meet the conditions in Table 2 to this subpart; and

(2) For each capture system subject to the operating limit in § 63.7790(b)(1), you have established appropriate site-specific operating limit(s) and have a record of the operating parameter data measured during the performance test in accordance with § 63.7824(a)(1); and

(3) For each venturi scrubber subject to the operating limits for pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate in § 63.7790(b)(2), you have established appropriate site-specific operating limits and have a record of the pressure drop and scrubber water flow rate measured during the performance test in accordance with § 63.7824(b).

(b) For each existing or new sinter plant subject to the operating limit in § 63.7790(d)(1), you have demonstrated initial compliance if the 30-day rolling average of the oil content of the feedstock, measured during the initial performance test in accordance with § 63.7824(d) is no more than 0.02 percent. For each existing or new sinter plant subject to the alternative operating limit in § 63.7790(d)(2), you have demonstrated initial compliance if the 30-day rolling average of the volatile organic compound emissions from the sinter plant windbox exhaust stream, measured during the initial performance test in accordance with § 63.7824(e) is no more than 0.2 lb/ton of sinter produced.

(c) For each emission limitation that applies to you, you must submit a notification of compliance status according to § 63.7840(e).
