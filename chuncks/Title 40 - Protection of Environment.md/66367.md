###### § 262.208 Removing containers of unwanted material from the laboratory.

(a) Removing containers of unwanted material on a regular schedule. An eligible academic entity must either:

(1) Remove all containers of unwanted material from each laboratory on a regular interval, not to exceed 12 months; or

(2) Remove containers of unwanted material from each laboratory within 12 months of each container's accumulation start date.

(b) The eligible academic entity must specify in Part I of its Laboratory Management Plan whether it will comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section for the regular removal of unwanted material from its laboratories.

(c) The eligible academic entity must specify in Part II of its Laboratory Management Plan how it will comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and develop a schedule for regular removals of unwanted material from its laboratories.

(d) Removing containers of unwanted material when volumes are exceeded.

(1) If a laboratory accumulates a total volume of unwanted material (including reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material) in excess of 55 gallons before the regularly scheduled removal, the eligible academic entity must ensure that all containers of unwanted material in the laboratory (including reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material):

(i) Are marked on the label that is associated with the container (or on the label that is affixed or attached to the container, if that is preferred) with the date that 55 gallons is exceeded; and

(ii) Are removed from the laboratory within 10 calendar days of the date that 55 gallons was exceeded, or at the next regularly scheduled removal, whichever comes first.

(2) If a laboratory accumulates more than 1 quart of liquid reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material or more than 1 kg (2.2 pounds) of solid reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material before the regularly scheduled removal, then the eligible academic entity must ensure that all containers of reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material:

(i) Are marked on the label that is associated with the container (or on the label that is affixed or attached to the container, if that is preferred) with the date that 1 quart or 1 kg is exceeded; and

(ii) Are removed from the laboratory within 10 calendar days of the date that 1 quart or 1 kg was exceeded, or at the next regularly scheduled removal, whichever comes first.
