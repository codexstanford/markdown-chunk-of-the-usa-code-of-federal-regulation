###### § 1036.655 Special provisions for diesel-fueled engines sold in American Samoa or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

(a) The prohibitions in § 1068.101(a)(1) do not apply to diesel-fueled engines that are intended for use and will be used in American Samoa or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, subject to the following conditions:

(1) The engine meets the emission standards that applied to model year 2006 engines as specified in appendix A of this part.

(2) You meet all the requirements of 40 CFR 1068.265.

(b) If you introduce an engine into U.S. commerce under this section, you must meet the labeling requirements in § 1036.135, but add the following statement instead of the compliance statement in § 1036.135(c)(8):

THIS ENGINE (or VEHICLE, as applicable) CONFORMS TO US EPA EMISSION STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO MODEL YEAR 2006. THIS ENGINE (or VEHICLE, as applicable) DOES NOT CONFORM TO US EPA EMISSION REQUIREMENTS IN EFFECT AT TIME OF PRODUCTION AND MAY NOT BE IMPORTED INTO THE UNITED STATES OR ANY TERRITORY OF THE UNITED STATES EXCEPT AMERICAN SAMOA OR THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS.

(c) Introducing into U.S. commerce an engine exempted under this section in any state or territory of the United States other than American Samoa or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, throughout its lifetime, violates the prohibitions in 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1), unless it is exempt under a different provision.

(d) The exemption provisions in this section also applied for model year 2007 and later engines introduced into commerce in Guam before January 1, 2024.
