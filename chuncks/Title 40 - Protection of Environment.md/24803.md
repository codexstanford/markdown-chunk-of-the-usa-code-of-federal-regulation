###### Emission Limits, Emission Standards and Operating Limits and Requirements
####### § 62.15960 What operating limits and requirements must I meet and by when?
######## i.e.,

You must meet, as applicable, the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of this section, according to the schedule specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The operating parameters for which you will establish operating limits for a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator or activated carbon injection are listed in Table 4 to this subpart. You must comply with the operating requirements in paragraph (f) of this section and the requirements in paragraph (g) of this section for meeting any new operating limits, re-established in § 62.16005. The operating limits apply at all times that sewage sludge is in the combustion chamber (until the sewage sludge feed to the combustor has been cut off for a period of time not less than the sewage sludge incineration residence time):

(a) You must meet a site-specific operating limit for minimum operating temperature of the combustion chamber (or afterburner combustion chamber) that you establish in § 62.15985;

(b) If you use a wet scrubber, electrostatic precipitator, activated carbon injection or afterburner to comply with an emission limit, you must meet the site-specific operating limits that you establish in § 62.15985 for each operating parameter associated with each air pollution control device;

(c) If you use a fabric filter to comply with the emission limits, you must install the bag leak detection system specified in §§ 62.15995(b) and 62.16020(b)(3)(i) and operate the bag leak detection system such that the alarm does not sound more than 5-percent of the operating time during a 6-month period. You must calculate the alarm time as specified in § 62.16005(a)(2)(i);

(d) You must meet the operating requirements in your site-specific fugitive emission monitoring plan, submitted as specified in § 62.15995(d) to ensure that your ash handling system will meet the emission standard for fugitive emissions from ash handling;

(e) You must meet the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section by the final compliance date specified in § 62.15875;

(f) You must monitor the feed rate and moisture content of the sewage sludge fed to the sewage sludge incinerator, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section:

(1) Continuously monitor the sewage sludge feed rate and calculate a daily average for all hours of operation during each 24-hour period. Keep a record of the daily average feed rate, as specified in § 62.16025(f)(3)(ii); and

(2) Take at least one grab sample per day of the sewage sludge fed to the sewage sludge incinerator. If you take more than one grab sample in a day, calculate the daily average for the grab samples. Keep a record of the daily average moisture content, as specified in § 62.16025(f)(3)(ii).

(g) For the operating limits and requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) and (h) of this section, you must meet any new operating limits and requirements, re-established according to § 62.16005(d)); and

(h) If you use an air pollution control device other than a wet scrubber, fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator or activated carbon injection to comply with the emission limits in Table 2 or 3 to this subpart, you must meet any site-specific operating limits or requirements that you establish as required in § 62.15965.
