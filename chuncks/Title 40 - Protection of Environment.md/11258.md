(d) A person shall not, after August 31, 1976, discharge into the atmosphere more than 3,000 pounds of organic materials in any 1 day or more than 450 pounds in any 1 hour from any article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance in which any non-photochemically reactive organic solvent or any material containing such a solvent is employed or applied, unless said discharge has been reduced by at least 85 percent. Emissions of organic materials into the atmosphere resulting from air- or heated-drying of products for the first 12 hours after their removal from any article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance described in this section shall be included in determining compliance with this section. Emissions resulting from baking, heat-curing, or heat-polymerizing as described in paragraph (b) of this section shall be excluded from determination of compliance with this section. Those portions of any series of articles, machines, equipment, or other contrivances designed for processing a continuous web, strip, or wire that emit organic materials in the course of using operations described in this section shall be collectively subject to compliance with this section.

(e) Emissions of organic materials to the atmosphere from the cleaning with photochemically reactive solvent, as defined in paragraph (k) of this section, of any article, machine, equipment, or other contrivance described in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section, shall be included with the other emissions of organic materials for determining compliance with this rule.

(f) Emissions of organic materials into the atmosphere required to be controlled by paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section, shall be reduced by:

(1) Incineration, provided that 90 percent or more of the carbon in the organic material being incinerated is oxidized to carbon dioxide, or

(2) Adsorption, or
