####### § 35.6150 Activities eligible for funding under enforcement Cooperative Agreements.

An enforcement Cooperative Agreement application from a State, political subdivision or Indian Tribe may request funding for the following enforcement activities:

(a) PRP searches;

(b) Issuance of notice letters and negotiation activities;

(c) Administrative and judicial enforcement actions taken under State or Indian Tribal law;

(d) Management assistance and oversight of PRPs during Federal enforcement response;

(e) Oversight of PRPs during a State, political subdivision or Indian Tribe enforcement response contingent on the applicant having taken all necessary action to compel PRPs to fund the oversight of cleanup activities negotiated under the recipient's enforcement authorities. If the State, political subdivision, Indian Tribe or EPA cannot obtain PRP commitment to fund such oversight activities, then these activities will be considered eligible for CERCLA funding under an enforcement Cooperative Agreement.
