##### Subpart LLL - Federal Plan Requirements for Sewage Sludge Incineration Units Constructed on or Before October 14, 2010
###### Compliance Schedules
####### § 62.15895 What if I do not meet the compliance date?

If you fail to submit a final control plan and achieve final compliance, you must submit a notification to the Administrator postmarked within 10 business days after the compliance date in Table 1 to this subpart. You must inform the Administrator that you did not achieve compliance, and you must continue to submit reports each subsequent calendar month until a final control plan is submitted and final compliance is met. An SSI unit that operates out of compliance after the final compliance date would be in violation of the federal plan and subject to enforcement action.
