###### Demonstrating Compliance for Open Molding Operations Controlled by Add-On Control Devices
####### § 63.5722 How do I use the performance test data to demonstrate initial compliance?

Demonstrate initial compliance with the open molding emission limit as described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section:

(a) Calculate the organic HAP limit you must achieve using equation 1 of § 63.5698. For determining initial compliance, the organic HAP limit is based on the amount of material used during the performance test, in megagrams, rather than during the past 12 months. Calculate the limit using the megagrams of resin and gel coat applied inside the enclosure during the three runs of the performance test and equation 1 of § 63.5698.

(b) Add the total measured emissions, in kilograms, from all three of the 1-hour runs of the performance test.

(c) If the total emissions from the three 1-hour runs of the performance test are less than the organic HAP limit calculated in paragraph (a) of this section, then you have demonstrated initial compliance with the emission limit in § 63.5698 for those operations performed in the enclosure and controlled by the add-on control device.
