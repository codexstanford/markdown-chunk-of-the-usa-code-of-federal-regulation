###### How To Apply for a TAG
####### § 35.4155 How does EPA decide whether to award a TAG to our group?

Once EPA determines your group meets the eligibility requirements in § 35.4020 the Agency considers whether and how successfully your group meets these criteria, each of which are of equal weight:

(a) Representation of groups and individuals affected by the site;

(b) Your group's plans to use the services of a technical advisor throughout the Superfund response action; and

(c) Your group's ability and plan to inform others in the community of the information provided by the technical advisor.
