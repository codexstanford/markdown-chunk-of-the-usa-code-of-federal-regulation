####### Payment for scheduled maintenance.

(g)Owners are responsible for properly maintaining their engines. This generally includes paying for scheduled maintenance. However, manufacturers must pay for scheduled maintenance during the useful life if it meets all the following criteria:

(1) Each affected component was not in general use on similar engines before 1997.

(2) The primary function of each affected component is to reduce emissions.

(3) Failure to perform the maintenance would not cause clear problems that would significantly degrade the engine's performance.
