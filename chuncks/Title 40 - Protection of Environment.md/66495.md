###### § 264.91 Required programs.

(a) Owners and operators subject to this subpart must conduct a monitoring and response program as follows:

(1) Whenever hazardous constituents under § 264.93 from a regulated unit are detected at a compliance point under § 264.95, the owner or operator must institute a compliance monitoring program under § 264.99. Detected is defined as statistically significant evidence of contamination as described in § 264.98(f);

(2) Whenever the ground-water protection standard under § 264.92 is exceeded, the owner or operator must institute a corrective action program under § 264.100. Exceeded is defined as statistically significant evidence of increased contamination as described in § 264.99(d);

(3) Whenever hazardous constituents under § 264.93 from a regulated unit exceed concentration limits under § 264.94 in ground water between the compliance point under § 264.95 and the downgradient facility property boundary, the owner or operator must institute a corrective action program under § 264.100; or

(4) In all other cases, the owner or operator must institute a detection monitoring program under § 264.98.

(b) The Regional Administrator will specify in the facility permit the specific elements of the monitoring and response program. The Regional Administrator may include one or more of the programs identified in paragraph (a) of this section in the facility permit as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment and will specify the circumstances under which each of the programs will be required. In deciding whether to require the owner or operator to be prepared to institute a particular program, the Regional Administrator will consider the potential adverse effects on human health and the environment that might occur before final administrative action on a permit modification application to incorporate such a program could be taken.
