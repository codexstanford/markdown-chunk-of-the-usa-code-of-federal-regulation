##### Subpart D - Compromise of Debts
###### § 13.24 General.

EPA may compromise claims for money or property where the claim, exclusive of interest, penalty and administrative costs, does not exceed $20,000. Where the claim exceeds $20,000, the authority to accept the compromise rests solely with DOJ. The Administrator may reject an offer of compromise in any amount. Where the claim exceeds $20,000 and EPA recommends acceptance of a compromise offer, it will refer the claim with its recommendation to DOJ for approval. The referral will be in the form of the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) and will outline the basis for EPA's recommendation. EPA refers compromise offers for claims in excess of $100,000 to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530, unless otherwise provided by Department of Justice delegations or procedures. EPA refers offers of compromise for claims of $20,000 to $100,000 to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. If the Administrator has a debtor's firm written offer for compromise which is substantial in amount but the Administrator is uncertain as to whether the offer should be accepted, he may refer the offer and the supporting data to DOJ or GAO for action.
