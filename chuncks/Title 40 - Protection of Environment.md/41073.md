###### § 66.13 Duties of source owner or operator upon receipt of a notice of noncompliance.

(a) Within forty-five days after receiving a notice of noncompliance a source owner or operator shall either:

(1) Calculate the amount of the penalty owed and the appropriate quarterly payment schedule, as provided in the Technical Support Document and Instruction Manual, and transmit that calculation, together with supporting data sufficient to allow verification of the penalty calculation, to the Administrator; or

(2) Submit a petition for reconsideration, alleging that the source is not in violation of applicable legal requirements or that the source owner or operator is entitled to an exemption pursuant to §§ 66.31 through 66.33, or both. A source owner or operator must present both grounds in the petition if he wishes to preserve a claim to an exemption in the event that the source is found to be in violation. Issues relating to the existence of a violation or entitlement to an exemption not raised in the petition shall be deemed waived.

(b) Any submittal pursuant to this subsection shall specify the identity of the person responsible for the payment of any noncompliance penalty, and to whom any reimbursement, if necessary, shall be sent.

(c) A source owner or operator may amend any petition for reconsideration pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section within 45 days from receipt of a notice of noncompliance. Amendment of such petition after 45 days will be permitted only if based on unforeseeable conditions occurring after termination of the 45 day period, or upon consent of the Administrator.
