##### Subpart QQQ - Standards of Performance for VOC Emissions From Petroleum Refinery Wastewater Systems
###### § 60.698 Reporting requirements.

(a) An owner or operator electing to comply with the provisions of § 60.693 shall notify the Administrator of the alternative standard selected in the report required in § 60.7.

(b)(1) Each owner or operator of a facility subject to this subpart shall submit to the Administrator within 60 days after initial startup a certification that the equipment necessary to comply with these standards has been installed and that the required initial inspections or tests of process drains, sewer lines, junction boxes, oil-water separators, and closed vent systems and control devices have been carried out in accordance with these standards. Thereafter, the owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator semiannually a certification that all of the required inspections have been carried out in accordance with these standards.

(2) Each owner or operator of an affected facility that uses a flare shall submit to the Administrator within 60 days after initial startup, as required under § 60.8(a), a report of the results of the performance test required in § 60.696(c).

(c) A report that summarizes all inspections when a water seal was dry or otherwise breached, when a drain cap or plug was missing or improperly installed, or when cracks, gaps, or other problems were identified that could result in VOC emissions, including information about the repairs or corrective action taken, shall be submitted initially and semiannually thereafter to the Administrator.

(d) As applicable, a report shall be submitted semiannually to the Administrator that indicates:

(1) Each 3-hour period of operation during which the average temperature of the gas stream in the combustion zone of a thermal incinerator, as measured by the temperature monitoring device, is more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the design combustion zone temperature,

(2) Each 3-hour period of operation during which the average temperature of the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed of a catalytic incinerator, as measured by the temperature monitoring device, is more than 28 &#xB0;C (50 &#xB0;F) below the design gas stream temperature, and any 3-hour period during which the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed (i.e., the difference between the temperatures of the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed), as measured by the temperature monitoring device, is less than 80 percent of the design temperature difference, or,

(3) Each 3-hour period of operation during which the average VOC concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases from a carbon adsorber is more than 20 percent greater than the design exhaust gas concentration level or reading.

(i) Each 3-hour period of operation during which the average volatile organic compound concentration level or reading of organics in the exhaust gases from a carbon adsorber which is regenerated directly onsite is more than 20 percent greater than the design exhaust gas concentration level or reading.

(ii) Each occurrence when the carbon in a carbon adsorber system that is not regenerated directly onsite in the control device is not replaced at the predetermined interval specified in § 60.695(a)(3)(ii).

(e) If compliance with the provisions of this subpart is delayed pursuant to § 60.692-7, the notification required under 40 CFR 60.7(a)(4) shall include the estimated date of the next scheduled refinery or process unit shutdown after the date of notification and the reason why compliance with the standards is technically impossible without a refinery or process unit shutdown.
