####### § 63.2264 Initial compliance demonstration for a hardwood veneer dryer.

If you operate a hardwood veneer dryer, you must record the annual volume percentage of softwood veneer species processed in the dryer as follows:

(a) Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the annual volume percentage of softwood species dried:

(b) You must designate and clearly identify each hardwood veneer dryer. Submit with the Notification of Compliance Status the annual volume percentage of softwood species dried in the dryer based on your dryer production for the 12 months prior to the compliance date specified for your source in § 63.2233. If you did not dry any softwood species in the dryer during the 12 months prior to the compliance date, then you need only to submit a statement indicating that no softwood species were dried. In addition, submit with the Notification of Compliance Status a signed statement by a responsible official that certifies with truth, accuracy, and completeness that the veneer dryer will be used to process less than 30 volume percent softwood species in the future.
