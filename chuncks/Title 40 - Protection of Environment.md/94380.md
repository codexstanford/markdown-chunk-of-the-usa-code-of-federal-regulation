(i) The shipment of PCB waste consists solely of PCB wastes with PCB concentrations below 50 ppm, unless the PCB concentration below 50 ppm was the result of dilution, in which case § 761.1(b) requires that the waste be managed as if it contained PCBs at the concentration prior to dilution.

(ii) The PCB waste is accepted by the transporter for transport only to a storage or disposal facility owned or operated by the generator of the PCB waste.

(2) [Reserved]

(b) Before transporting the PCB waste, the transporter must sign and date the manifest acknowledging acceptance of the PCB waste from the generator. The transporter must return a signed copy to the generator before leaving the generator's property.

(c) The transporter shall ensure that the manifest accompanies the PCB waste.

(d) A transporter who delivers PCB waste to another transporter or to the designated facility must:

(1) Obtain the date of delivery and the handwritten signature of that transporter or of the owner or operator of the designated facility on the manifest; and

(4) The person delivering the PCB waste to the initial water (bulk shipment) transporter obtains the date of delivery and signature of the water (bulk shipment) transporter on the manifest and forwards it to the designated facility; and

(5) A copy of the shipping paper or manifest is retained by each water (bulk shipment) transporter in accordance with § 761.214.

(f) For shipments involving rail transportation, the requirements of paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) do not apply and the following requirements do apply:

(i) Sign and date the manifest acknowledging acceptance of the PCB waste;

(ii) Return a signed copy of the manifest to the non-rail transporter;

(iii) Forward at least three copies of the manifest to:

(ii) Retain a copy of the manifest or signed shipping paper in accordance with § 761.214.

(4) When delivering PCB waste to a non-rail transporter a rail transporter must:

(i) Obtain the date of delivery and the handwritten signature of the next non-rail transporter on the manifest; and
