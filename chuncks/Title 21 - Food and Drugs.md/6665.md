The common name for this form of the additive is low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose.

(b) The additive is used or intended for use as follows:

(1) The additive identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is used or intended for use as an emulsifier, film former, protective colloid, stabilizer, suspending agent, or thickener in food, in accordance with good manufacturing practice.
