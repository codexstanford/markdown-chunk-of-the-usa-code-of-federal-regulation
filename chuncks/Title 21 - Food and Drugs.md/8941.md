###### § 207.57 What information must registrants submit when updating listing information and when?

Registrants must review and update listing information at a minimum, as follows:

(a) Registrants must provide listing information at the time of annual establishment registration for any drug manufactured, repacked, relabeled, or salvaged by them for commercial distribution that has not been listed previously.

(b) Registrants must review and update their drug listing information each June and December. When doing so, registrants must:

(1)(i) Provide listing information, in accordance with §§ 207.49, 207.53, and 207.54, for any drug manufactured, repacked, relabeled, or salvaged by them for commercial distribution that has not been previously listed;

(ii) Submit the date that they discontinued the manufacture, repacking, relabeling or salvaging for commercial distribution of a listed drug and provide the expiration date of the last lot manufactured, repacked, relabeled, or salvaged;

(iii) Submit the date that they resumed the manufacture, repacking, or relabeling for commercial distribution of a drug previously discontinued, and provide any required listing information not previously submitted; and

(iv) Submit any material changes in any information previously submitted pursuant to §§ 207.49, 207.53, 207.54, or other relevant sections of this part; or

(2) For each listed drug, certify that no changes subject to reporting under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section have occurred if no such changes have occurred since the last review and update. If a drug is discontinued and FDA has received the information required under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, no further certifications are necessary for the discontinued drug. After initial electronic listing, registrants may satisfy the listing update requirement with respect to unchanged listing information by making a single "no changes" certification during the annual registration update under § 207.29(b) applicable to all of the registrant's listed drugs for which no changes have been made since the previous annual registration update.

(c) Registrants are encouraged to submit listing information for every drug subject to listing under this part prior to commercial distribution and are encouraged to update listing information at the time of any change affecting information previously submitted.
