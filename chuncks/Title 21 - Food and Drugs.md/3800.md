To do so, quality control personnel must perform operations that include:

(b) Reviewing and approving the documentation setting forth the basis for qualification of any supplier;

(c) Reviewing and approving the documentation setting forth the basis for why meeting in-process specifications, in combination with meeting component specifications, will help ensure that the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement are met;

(d) Reviewing and approving the documentation setting forth the basis for why the results of appropriate tests or examinations for each product specification selected under § 111.75(c)(1) will ensure that the finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications;

(e) Reviewing and approving the basis and the documentation for why any product specification is exempted from the verification requirements in § 111.75(c)(1), and for why any component and in-process testing, examination, or monitoring, or other methods will ensure that such exempted product specification is met without verification through periodic testing of the finished batch;

(f) Ensuring that required representative samples are collected;

(g) Ensuring that required reserve samples are collected and held;

(h) Determining whether all specifications established under § 111.70(a) are met; and

(i) Performing other operations required under this subpart.
