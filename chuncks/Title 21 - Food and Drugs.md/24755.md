The Department of Health and Human Services will pay for all import samples of electronic products rendered unsalable as a result of testing, or will pay the reasonable costs of repackaging such samples for sale, if the samples are found to be in compliance with the requirements of Subchapter C-Electronic Product Radiation Control of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (formerly the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968). Billing for reimbursement should be made by the owner or consignee to the Food and Drug Administration division where the shipment was offered for import.
