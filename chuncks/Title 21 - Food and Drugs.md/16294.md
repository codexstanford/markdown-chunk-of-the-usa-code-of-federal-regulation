###### § 530.25 Orders prohibiting extralabel uses for drugs in food-producing animals.

(a) FDA may issue an order prohibiting extralabel use of an approved new animal or human drug in food-producing animals if the agency finds, after providing an opportunity for public comment, that:

(1) An acceptable analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA or that such method cannot be established; or

(2) The extralabel use in animals presents a risk to the public health.

(b) After making a determination that the analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed and submitted, or that such method cannot be established, or that an extralabel use in animals of a particular human drug or animal drug presents a risk to the public health, FDA will publish in thewith a 90-day delayed effective date, an order of prohibition for an extralabel use of a drug in food-producing animals. Such order shall state that an acceptable analytical method required under § 530.22 has not been developed, submitted, and found to be acceptable by FDA; that such method cannot be established; or that the extralabel use in animals presents a risk to the public health; and shall:

(1) Specify the nature and extent of the order of prohibition and the reasons for the prohibition;

(2) Request public comments; and

(3) Provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments.

(c) The order of prohibition will become effective 90 days after date of publication of the order unless FDA publishes a notice in theprior to that date, that revokes the order of prohibition, modifies it, or extends the period of public comment.

(d) The agency may publish an order of prohibition with a shorter comment period and/or delayed effective date than specified in paragraph (b) of this section in exceptional circumstances (e.g., where there is immediate risk to the public health), provided that the order of prohibition states that the comment period and/or effective date have been abbreviated because there are exceptional circumstances, and the order of prohibition sets forth the agency's rationale for taking such action.

(e) If FDA publishes a notice in themodifying an order of prohibition, the agency will specify in the modified order of prohibition the nature and extent of the modified prohibition, the reasons for it, and the agency's response to any comments on the original order of prohibition.

(f) A current listing of drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals will be codified in § 530.41.

(g) After the submission of appropriate information (i.e., adequate data, an acceptable method, approval of a new animal drug application for the prohibited extralabel use, or information demonstrating that the prohibition was based on incorrect data), FDA may, by publication of an appropriate notice in theremove a drug from the list of human and animal drugs prohibited for extralabel use in animals, or may modify a prohibition.

(h) FDA may prohibit extralabel use of a drug in food-producing animals without establishing a safe level.
