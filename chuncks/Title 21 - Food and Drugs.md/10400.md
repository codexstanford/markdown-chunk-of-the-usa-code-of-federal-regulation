###### § 328.50 Principal display panel of all OTC drug products intended for oral ingestion that contain alcohol.

(a) The amount (percentage) of alcohol present in a product shall be stated in terms of percent volume of absolute alcohol at 60 &#xB0;F (15.56 &#xB0;C) in accordance with § 201.10(d)(2) of this chapter.

(b) A statement expressing the amount (percentage) of alcohol present in a product shall appear prominently and conspicuously on the "principal display panel," as defined in § 201.60 of this chapter. For products whose principal display panel is on the immediate container label and that are not marketed in another retail package (e.g., an outer box), the statement of the percentage of alcohol present in the product shall appear prominently and conspicuously on the "principal display panel" of the immediate container label.

(c) For products whose principal display panel is on the retail package and the retail package is not the immediate container, the statement of the percentage of alcohol present in the product shall also appear on the immediate container label; it may appear anywhere on that label in accord with section 502(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

(d) The statement expressing the amount (percentage) of alcohol present in the product shall be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the panel or label on which it appears, and shall be in lines generally parallel to the base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed.

(e) For a product to state in its labeling that it is "alcohol free," it must contain no alcohol (0 percent).

(f) For any OTC drug product intended for oral ingestion containing over 5 percent alcohol and labeled for use by adults and children 12 years of age and over, the labeling shall contain the following statement in the directions section: "Consult a physician for use in children under 12 years of age."

(g) For any OTC drug product intended for oral ingestion containing over 0.5 percent alcohol and labeled for use by children ages 6 to under 12 years of age, the labeling shall contain the following statement in the directions section: "Consult a physician for use in children under 6 years of age."

(h) When the direction regarding age in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section differs from an age-limiting direction contained in any OTC drug monograph in this chapter, the direction containing the more stringent age limitation shall be used.
