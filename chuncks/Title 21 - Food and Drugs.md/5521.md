Such packing medium may be thickened with pectin and may contain any mixture of any edible organic salt or salts and any edible organic acid or acids as a flavor-enhancing agent, in a quantity not more than is reasonably required for that purpose.

(b)(1) The specified name of the food is "artificially sweetened ______", the blank being filled in with the name prescribed by § 145.170(a) for canned peaches having the same optional peach ingredient.

(2) The artificially sweetened food is subject to the requirements for label statement of ingredients used, as prescribed for canned peaches by § 145.170(a). If the packing medium is thickened with pectin, the label shall bear the statement "thickened with pectin". When any organic salt or acid or any mixture of two or more of these is added, the label shall bear the common or usual name of each such ingredient.
