## Chapter I - Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services
### Subchapter C - Drugs: General
#### PART 251 - SECTION 804 IMPORTATION PROGRAM
##### Subpart B - Section 804 Importation Program Proposals and Pre-Import Requests
###### § 251.7 Suspension and revocation of authorized importation programs.

(a) FDA may suspend a SIP under any of the circumstances set forth in § 251.18, or under any other circumstances in FDA's discretion. An eligible prescription drug cannot be shipped into the United States under this part, and is subject to refusal of admission into the United States, if FDA has suspended the SIP or revoked its authorization.

(b) SIP Sponsors and other SIP participants must agree to submit to audits of their books and records and inspections of their facilities as a condition of participation in a SIP. If a SIP Sponsor, manufacturer, Foreign Seller, Importer, qualifying laboratory, or other participant in the supply chain delays, denies, or limits an inspection, or refuses to permit entry, inspection, or audit of its facility or its records, FDA may suspend the SIP, in whole or in part, immediately.

(c) FDA may revoke authorization of a SIP, in whole or in part, including with respect to one or more drugs in the SIP, at any time if FDA determines that:

(1) The SIP Proposal contained an untrue statement of material fact;

(2) The SIP Proposal omitted material information;

(3) The SIP no longer meets the requirements of section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, this part, or the SIP, including, among other things, if FDA finds that the manufacturer, the Foreign Seller, the Importer, or any other supply chain participant is found to be not compliant with section 501(a)(2)(A) or (B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;

(4) Continued implementation of the SIP is reasonably likely to pose additional risk to the public's health and safety;

(5) Confidential manufacturer information was disclosed in violation of § 251.16;

(6) Continued implementation of the SIP is not reasonably likely to result in a significant reduction in the cost of the drugs covered by the SIP to the American consumer;

(7) Continued monitoring of the SIP imposes too much of a burden on FDA or HHS resources for carrying out this part or is inconsistent with FDA or HHS prioritization of resources;

(8) Continued implementation of the SIP is otherwise inappropriate; or

(9) Grounds exist for suspension under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and FDA determines it should revoke, either instead of, or after, suspension.
