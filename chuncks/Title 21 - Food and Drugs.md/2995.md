###### § 99.501 Recordkeeping and reports.

(a) A manufacturer disseminating information under this part shall:

(1) Maintain records sufficient to allow the manufacturer to take corrective action as required by FDA. The manufacturer shall make such records available to FDA, upon request, for inspection and copying. Such records shall either:

(i) Identify, by name, those persons receiving the disseminated information; or

(ii) Identify, by category, the recipients of the disseminated information, unless FDA requires the manufacturer to retain records identifying individual recipients of the disseminated information. Manufacturers whose records identify recipients by category only shall:

(A) Identify subcategories of recipients where appropriate (e.g., oncologists, pediatricians, obstetricians, etc.); and

(B) Ensure that any corrective action to be taken will be sufficiently conspicuous to individuals within that category of recipients;

(2) Maintain an identical copy of the information disseminated under this part; and

(3) Upon the submission of a supplemental application to FDA, notify the appropriate office identified in § 99.201(c) of this part.

(b) A manufacturer disseminating information on a new use for a drug or device shall, on a semiannual basis, submit to the FDA office identified in § 99.201(c) of this part:

(1) A list containing the titles of articles and reference publications relating to the new use of drugs or devices that the manufacturer disseminated to a health care practitioner, pharmacy benefit manager, health insurance issuer, group health plan, or Federal or State Government agency. The list shall cover articles and reference publications disseminated in the 6-month period preceding the date on which the manufacturer provides the list to FDA;

(2) A list identifying the categories of health care practitioners, pharmacy benefit managers, health insurance issuers, group health plans, or Federal or State Government agencies that received the articles and reference publications in the 6-month period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The list shall also identify which category of recipients received a particular article or reference publication;

(3) A notice and summary of any additional clinical research or other data relating to the safety or effectiveness of the new use, and, if the manufacturer possesses such clinical research or other data, a copy of the research or data. Such other data may include, but is not limited to, new articles published in scientific or medical journals, reference publications, and summaries of adverse effects that are or may be associated with the new use;

(4) If the manufacturer is conducting studies necessary for the submission of a supplemental application, the manufacturer shall submit periodic progress reports on these studies to FDA. Such reports shall describe the studies' current status (i.e., progress on patient enrollment, any significant problems that could affect the manufacturer's ability to complete the studies, and expected completion dates). If the manufacturer discontinues or terminates a study before completing it, the manufacturer shall, as part of the next periodic progress report, state the reasons for such discontinuation or termination; and

(5) If the manufacturer was granted an exemption from the requirements to submit a supplemental application for the new use, any new or additional information that relates to whether the manufacturer continues to meet the requirements for such exemption. This information may include, but is not limited to, new or additional information regarding revenues from the product that is the subject of the dissemination and new or additional information regarding the persuasiveness of the data on the new use, including information regarding whether the new use is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy.

(c) A manufacturer shall maintain a copy of all information, lists, records, and reports required or disseminated under this part for 3 years after it has ceased dissemination of such information and make such documents available to FDA for inspection and copying.
