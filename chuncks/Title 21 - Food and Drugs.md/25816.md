###### § 1271.23 How is a waiver from the electronic format requirements requested?

(a) You may request a waiver from the requirement in § 1271.22 that information must be provided to FDA in electronic format. Submission of a request for waiver does not excuse timely compliance with the registration and listing requirements. FDA will grant a waiver request if FDA determines that the use of electronic means for submission of registration and listing information is not reasonable for the registrant making the waiver request.

(b) Waiver requests under this section must be submitted in writing and must include the specific reasons why electronic submission is not reasonable for the registrant and a U.S. telephone number and mailing address where FDA can contact the registrant. Waiver requests may be sent to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), Document Control Center (see addresses in § 600.2 of this chapter).

(c) If FDA grants the waiver request, FDA may limit its duration and will specify terms of the waiver and provide information on how to submit establishment registration, listings, other information, and updates, as applicable.
