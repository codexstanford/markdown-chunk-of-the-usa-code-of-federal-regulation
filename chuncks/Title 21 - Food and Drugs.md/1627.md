###### § 26.67 Suspension of listed conformity assessment bodies.

The following procedures shall apply with regard to the suspension of a conformity assessment body (CAB) listed in subpart B of this part.

(a) A party shall notify the other party of its contestation of the technical competence or compliance of a CAB listed in subpart B of this part and the contesting party's intent to suspend such CAB. Such contestation shall be exercised when justified in an objective and reasoned manner in writing to the other party;

(b) The CAB shall be given prompt notice by the other party and an opportunity to present information in order to refute the contestation or to correct the deficiencies which form the basis of the contestation;

(c) Any such contestation shall be discussed between the parties in the Joint Sectoral Committee described in subpart B of this part. If there is no Joint Sectoral Committee, the contesting party shall refer the matter directly to the Joint Committee. If agreement to suspend is reached by the Joint Sectoral Committee or, if there is no Joint Sectoral Committee, by the Joint Committee, the CAB shall be suspended;

(d) Where the Joint Sectoral Committee or Joint Committee decides that verification of technical competence or compliance is required, it shall normally be carried out in a timely manner by the party in whose territory the body in question is located, but may be carried out jointly by the parties in justified cases;

(e) If the matter has not been resolved by the Joint Sectoral Committee within 10 days of the notice of contestation, the matter shall be referred to the Joint Committee for a decision. If there is no Joint Sectoral Committee, the matter shall be referred directly to the Joint Committee. If no decision is reached by the Joint Committee within 10 days of the referral to it, the CAB shall be suspended upon the request of the contesting party;

(f) Upon the suspension of a CAB listed in subpart B of this part, a party is no longer obligated to accept or recognize the results of conformity assessment procedures performed by that CAB subsequent to suspension. A party shall continue to accept the results of conformity assessment procedures performed by that CAB prior to suspension, unless a regulatory authority of the party decides otherwise based on health, safety or environmental considerations or failure to satisfy other requirements within the scope of subpart B of this part; and

(g) The suspension shall remain in effect until agreement has been reached by the parties upon the future status of that body.
