###### § 26.46 Listing of additional CAB's.

(a) During the operational period, additional conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) will be considered for equivalence using the procedures and criteria described in §§ 26.36, 26.37, and 26.39, taking into account the level of confidence gained in the overall regulatory system of the other party.

(b) Once a designating authority considers that such CAB's, having undergone the procedures of §§ 26.36, 26.37, and 26.39, may be determined to be equivalent, it will then designate those bodies on an annual basis. Such procedures satisfy the procedures of § 26.66(a) and (b).

(c) Following such annual designations, the procedures for confirmation of CAB's under § 26.66(c) and (d) shall apply.
