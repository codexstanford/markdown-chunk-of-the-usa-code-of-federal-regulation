###### § 175.260 Partial phosphoric acid esters of polyester resins.

Partial phosphoric acid esters of polyester resins identified in this section and applied on aluminum may be safely used as food-contact coatings, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(a) For the purpose of this section, partial phosphoric acid esters of polyester resins are prepared by the reaction of trimellitic anhydride with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol followed by reaction of the resin thus produced with phosphoric acid anhydride to produce a resin having an acid number of 81 to 98 and a phosphorus content of 4.05 to 4.65 percent by weight.

(b) The coating is chemically bonded to the metal and cured at temperatures exceeding 450 &#xB0;F.

(c) The finished food-contact coating, when extracted with the solvent or solvents characterizing the type of food and under the conditions of time and temperature characterizing the conditions of its intended use, as determined from tables 1 and 2 of § 175.300(d), yields total extractives in each extracting solvent not to exceed 0.3 milligrams per square inch of food-contact surface, as determined by the methods described in § 175.300(e), and the coating yields 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediol in each extracting solvent not to exceed 0.3 micrograms per square inch of food-contact surface. In testing the finished food-contact articles, a separate test sample is to be used for each required extracting solvent.
