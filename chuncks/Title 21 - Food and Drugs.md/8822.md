Donated drug samples shall be placed by the donor in a sealed carton for delivery to or collection by the recipient charitable institution.

(c) A donated drug sample shall not be dispensed to a patient or be distributed to another charitable institution until it has been examined by a licensed practitioner or registered pharmacist at the recipient charitable institution to confirm that the donation record accurately describes the drug sample delivered and that no drug sample is adulterated or misbranded for any reason, including, but not limited to, the following:

(e) The recipient charitable institution shall prepare at the time of collection or delivery of a drug sample a complete and accurate donation record, a copy of which shall be retained by the recipient charitable institution for at least 3 years, containing the following information:

(1) The name, address, and telephone number of the licensed practitioner (or donating charitable institution);

(2) The manufacturer, brand name, quantity, and lot or control number of the drug sample donated; and

(3) The date of the donation.

(f) Each recipient charitable institution shall maintain complete and accurate records of donation, receipt, inspection, inventory, dispensing, redistribution, destruction, and returns sufficient for complete accountability and auditing of drug sample stocks.
