###### Requirements for Recognized Accreditation Bodies
####### § 1.1119 What are the conflict of interest requirements for a recognized accreditation body?
######## e.g.,

(c) An accreditation body (and its officers, employees, or other agents involved in LAAF-accreditation activities) may have an interest in a publicly traded or publicly available investment fund (a mutual fund), or a widely held pension or similar fund if the accreditation body (and its officers, employees, or other agents involved in LAAF-accreditation activities) neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in the fund.

(d) A recognized accreditation body's agent that is a contract assessor will be permitted to own or have a financial interest in, manage, or otherwise control a LAAF-accredited laboratory if all of the following circumstances apply:

(1) The contract assessor's primary occupation is owning or having a financial interest in, managing, or otherwise controlling a LAAF-accredited laboratory;

(2) The assessor contracts with the recognized accreditation body to provide assessment services on an intermittent or part-time basis;

(3) The contract assessor does not assess the LAAF-accredited laboratory that the assessor owns or has a financial interest in, manages, or otherwise controls; and

(4) The contract assessor and the recognized accreditation body inform any laboratory that the contract assessor may assess or reassess for LAAF-accreditation that the contract assessor owns or has a financial interest in, manages, or otherwise controls a LAAF-accredited laboratory. The laboratory seeking LAAF-accreditation assessment or reassessment must acknowledge that the contract assessor owns or has a financial interest in, manages, or otherwise controls a LAAF-accredited laboratory and be provided the option to be assessed by a different representative of the recognized accreditation body.

(e) The prohibited items of value specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section do not include:

(1) Money representing payment of fees for LAAF-accreditation services or reimbursement of direct costs associated with an onsite assessment or reassessment of the laboratory; or

(2) Meal of de minimis value provided during the course of an assessment or reassessment and on the premises where the assessment or reassessment is conducted, if necessary for the efficient conduct of the assessment or reassessment.
