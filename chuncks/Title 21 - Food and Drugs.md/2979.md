###### § 99.103 Mandatory statements and information.

(a) Any information disseminated under this part shall include:

(1) A prominently displayed statement disclosing:

(i) For a drug, "This information concerns a use that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration." For devices, the statement shall read, "This information concerns a use that has not been approved or cleared by the Food and Drug Administration." If the information to be disseminated includes both an approved and unapproved use or uses or a cleared and uncleared use or uses, the manufacturer shall modify the statement to identify the unapproved or uncleared new use or uses. The manufacturer shall permanently affix the statement to the front of each reprint or copy of an article from a scientific or medical journal and to the front of each reference publication disseminated under this part;

(ii) If applicable, the information is being disseminated at the expense of the manufacturer;

(iii) If applicable, the names of any authors of the information who were employees of, or consultants to, or received compensation from the manufacturer, or who had a significant financial interest in the manufacturer during the time that the study that is the subject of the dissemination was conducted up through 1 year after the time the article/reference publication was written and published;

(iv) If applicable, a statement that there are products or treatments that have been approved or cleared for the use that is the subject of the information being disseminated; and

(v) The identification of any person that has provided funding for the conduct of a study relating to the new use of a drug or device for which such information is being disseminated; and

(2) The official labeling for the drug or device;

(3) A bibliography of other articles (that concern reports of clinical investigations both supporting and not supporting the new use) from a scientific reference publication or scientific or medical journal that have been previously published about the new use of the drug or device covered by the information that is being disseminated, unless the disseminated information already includes such a bibliography; and

(4) Any additional information required by FDA under § 99.301(a)(2). Such information shall be attached to the front of the disseminated information or, if attached to the back of the disseminated information, its presence shall be made known to the reader by a sticker or notation on the front of the disseminated information and may consist of:

(i) Objective and scientifically sound information pertaining to the safety or effectiveness of the new use of the drug or device and which FDA determines is necessary to provide objectivity and balance. This may include information that the manufacturer has submitted to FDA or, where appropriate, a summary of such information and any other information that can be made publicly available; and

(ii) An objective statement prepared by FDA, based on data or other scientifically sound information, bearing on the safety or effectiveness of the new use of the drug or device.

(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(4) of this section, the statements, bibliography, and other information required by this section shall be attached to such disseminated information.

(c) For purposes of this section, factors to be considered in determining whether a statement is "prominently displayed" may include, but are not limited to, type size, font, layout, contrast, graphic design, headlines, spacing, and any other technique to achieve emphasis or notice. The required statements shall be outlined, boxed, highlighted, or otherwise graphically designed and presented in a manner that achieves emphasis or notice and is distinct from the other information being disseminated.
