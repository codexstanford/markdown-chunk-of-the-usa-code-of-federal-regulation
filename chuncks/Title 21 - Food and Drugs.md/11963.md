##### Subpart C - Index of Legally Marketed Unapproved New Animal Drugs for Minor Species
###### § 516.111 Scope of this subpart.

This subpart implements section 572 of the act and provides standards and procedures to establish an index of legally marketed unapproved new animal drugs. This subpart applies only to minor species and not to minor use in major species. This index is only available for new animal drugs intended for use in a minor species for which there is a reasonable certainty that the animal or edible products from the animal will not be consumed by humans or food-producing animals and for new animal drugs intended for use only in a hatchery, tank, pond, or other similar contained man-made structure in an early, nonfood life stage of a food-producing minor species, where safety for humans is demonstrated in accordance with the standard of section 512(d) of the act (including, for an antimicrobial new animal drug, with respect to antimicrobial resistance). The index shall not include a new animal drug that is contained in, or a product of, a transgenic animal. Among its topics, this subpart sets forth the standards and procedures for:

(a) Investigational exemptions for indexing purposes;

(b) Submissions to FDA of requests for determination of eligibility of a new animal drug for indexing;

(c) Establishment and operation of expert panels;

(d) Submissions to FDA of requests for addition of a new animal drug to the index;

(e) Modifications to index listings;

(f) Publication of the index; and

(g) Records and reports.
