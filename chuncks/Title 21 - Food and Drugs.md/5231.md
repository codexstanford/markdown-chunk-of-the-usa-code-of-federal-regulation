(a) Instantized flours, instant blending flours, and quick-mixing flours, are the foods each of which conforms to the definition and standard of identity and is subject to the requirement for label statement of ingredients prescribed for the corresponding kind of flour by §§ 137.105, 137.155, 137.160, 137.165, 137.175, 137.180, and 137.185, except that each such flour has been made by one of the optional procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and is thereby made readily pourable. Such flours will all pass through a No. 20 mesh U.S. standard sieve (840-micron opening), and not more than 20 percent will pass through a 200 mesh U.S standard sieve (74-micron opening).

(b) The optional procedures referred to in paragraph (a) of this section are:

(1) A selective grinding and bolting procedure or other milling procedure, whereby controlled techniques are used to obtain a food too fine to meet the granulation specification prescribed in § 137.300(a) for farina.

(2) An agglomerating procedure, whereby flour that originally meets the granulation specification prescribed in § 137.105(a) has been modified by further processing, so that a number of the individual flour particles have been combined into agglomerates conforming to the granulation specifications set out in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The name of each product covered by this section is the name prescribed by the definition and standard of identity for the corresponding kind of flour as referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, preceded immediately and conspicuously by the words "Instantized", "Instant blending", or "Quick-mixing".
