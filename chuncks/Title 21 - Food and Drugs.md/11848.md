(4) Methods used in or the facilities and controls used for the manufacture, processing, or packing of the product from such methods, facilities, and controls described in the application;

(5) Labeling from the specimens contained in the application; or

(1) Investigations as to the safety, effectiveness, identity, strength, quality, or purity of the drug, made by the applicant on the drug, or

(2) Investigations or experience with the product that is the subject of the application, or any related product, available to the applicant from any source if such information is pertinent to an evaluation of the safety, effectiveness, identity, strength, quality, or purity of the drug, when such omission would bias an evaluation of the safety or effectiveness of the product.
