####### Classification.

(b)Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:

(1) Premarket notification submissions must include the following information:

(i) A detailed description of the device that includes:

(A) A detailed description of all components in the test system, including a description of the assay components in the kit and all required ancillary reagents;

(B) A detailed description of instrumentation and equipment, and illustrations or photographs of non-standard equipment or methods if applicable;

(C) Detailed documentation of the device software, including, but not limited to, standalone software applications and hardware-based devices that incorporate software where applicable;

(D) A detailed description of appropriate internal and external quality controls that are recommended or provided. The description must identify those control elements that are incorporated into the recommended testing procedures;

(E) Detailed specifications for sample collection, processing, and storage;

(F) A detailed description of methodology and assay procedure; and

(G) Detailed specification of the criteria for test results interpretation and reporting.

(ii) Information that demonstrates the performance characteristics of the device, including:

(A) Device precision/reproducibility data generated from within-run, between-run, between-day, between-lot, between-operator, between-instruments, between-site, and total precision for multiple nonconsecutive days as applicable. A well characterized panel of patient samples or pools from the intended use population that covers the device measuring range must be used;

(B) Device linearity data generated from patient samples covering the assay measuring range if applicable;

(C) Information on traceability to a reference material and description of value assignment of calibrators and controls if applicable;

(D) Device analytical sensitivity data, including limit of blank, limit of detection and limit of quantitation if applicable;

(E) Device analytical specificity data, including interference by endogenous and exogenous substances, as well as cross-reactivity with samples derived from patients with other autoimmune diseases or conditions;

(F) Device instrument carryover data when applicable;

(G) Device stability data including real-time stability under various storage times and temperatures;

(H) Specimen stability data, including stability under various storage times, temperatures, freeze-thaw, and transport conditions where appropriate;

(I) Method comparison data generated by comparison of the results obtained with the device to those obtained with a legally marketed predicate device with similar indication of use. Patient samples from the intended use population covering the device measuring range must be used;

(J) Specimen matrix comparison data if more than one specimen type or anticoagulant can be tested with the device. Samples used for comparison must be from patient samples covering the device measuring range;

(K) A description of how the assay cut-off (the medical decision point between positive and negative) was established and validated as well as supporting data;

(L) Clinical performance must be established by comparing data generated by testing samples from the intended use population and the differential diagnosis groups with the device to the clinical diagnostic standard. The diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus must be based on clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, such as one or more pancreatic or insulin autoantibody test. Because the intended use population for Type 1 diabetes mellitus includes subjects less than 18 years old, samples from representative numbers of these subjects must be included. Representative numbers of samples from all age strata must also be included. The differential diagnosis groups must include, but not be limited to the following: Type 2 diabetes mellitus; metabolic syndrome; latent autoimmune diabetes in adults; other autoimmune diseases such as celiac disease (without a concomitant diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes mellitus), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis; infection; renal disease; and testicular cancer. Diseases for the differential groups must be based on established diagnostic criteria and clinical evaluation. For all samples, the diagnostic clinical criteria and the demographic information must be collected and provided. The clinical validation results must demonstrate clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity for the test values based on the presence or absence of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The data must be summarized in tabular format comparing the interpretation of results to the disease status; and

(M) Expected/reference values generated by testing an adequate number of samples from apparently healthy normal individuals.

(iii) Identification of risk mitigation elements used by the device, including description of all additional procedures, methods, and practices incorporated into the directions for use that mitigate risks associated with testing.

(2) Your 21 CFR 809.10(a) compliant label and 21 CFR 809.10(b) compliant labeling must include warnings relevant to the assay including:

(i) A warning statement that reads, "The device is for use by laboratory professionals in a clinical laboratory setting";
