###### § 880.6600 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation chamber disinfection device.
####### Classification

(b)-Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:

(1) Performance testing must demonstrate the following:

(i) The chamber's ability to control the UV radiation dose during operation.

(ii) The chamber's disinfection performance through microbial challenge testing.

(iii) Evidence that the equipment intended to be processed is UV compatible.

(iv) Validation of the cleaning and disinfection procedures.

(v) The ability of the device to continue to perform to all specification after cleaning and disinfection.

(vi) Whether the device generates ozone (if so, 21 CFR 801.415, Maximum acceptable level of ozone, applies).

(2) Appropriate software verification, validation, and hazard analysis must be performed.

(3) Appropriate analysis and/or testing must validate electrical safety, mechanical safety, and electromagnetic compatibility of the device in its intended use environment.

(4) The labeling must include:

(i) UV hazard warning labels.

(ii) Explanation of all displays and/or labeling on user interface.

(iii) Explanation of device safety interlocks.

(iv) Explanation of all disinfection cycle signals, cautions and warnings.
