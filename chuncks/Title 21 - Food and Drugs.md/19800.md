(b) A requester may supplement or amend a pending De Novo request to revise existing information or provide additional information.

(1) FDA may require additional information regarding the device that is necessary for FDA to complete the review of the De Novo request.

(2) Additional information submitted to FDA must include the reference number assigned to the original De Novo request and, if submitted on the requester's own initiative, the reason for submitting the additional information.
