###### § 1114.31 Issuance of a marketing granted order.

(a) FDA will issue a marketing granted order if it finds that none of the grounds for denial listed in section 910(c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply. A marketing granted order becomes effective on the date it is issued.

(b) FDA may include, as part of the marketing granted order:

(1) Restrictions on the sale and distribution of the product, including restrictions on the access to, and the advertising and promotion of, the tobacco product, to the extent that it would be authorized to impose such restrictions under a regulation issued under section 906(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;

(2) Any restrictions on the sales, distribution, advertising, and promotion of the new tobacco product that the applicant proposed to be included as part of a marketing granted order under section 910(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to support a finding by FDA that permitting the product to be marketed would be appropriate for the protection of the public health; and

(3) Requirements to establish and maintain records, and submit postmarket reports under section 910(f) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in addition to those described in § 1114.41, including but not limited to information such as labeling, advertising, marketing, promotional materials, or marketing plans not previously submitted to FDA.
