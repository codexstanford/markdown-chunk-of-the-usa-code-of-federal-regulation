(a)(1) Pasteurized neufchatel cheese spread with other foods is the class of foods each of which is prepared by mixing, with the aid of heat, neufchatel cheese with one or a mixture of two or more properly prepared foods (except other cheeses), such as fresh, cooked, canned, or dried fruits or vegetables; cooked or canned meats; relishes, pickles or other foods suitable for blending with neufchatel cheese. It may contain one or any mixture of two or more of the optional ingredients named in paragraph (b) of this section. The amount of the added food or foods must be sufficient to so differentiate the blend that it does not simulate neufchatel cheese. It is spreadable at 70 &#xB0;F.

(2) During its preparation the mixture is heated for not less than 30 seconds at a temperature of not less than 150 &#xB0;F. When tested for phosphatase by the method prescribed in § 133.5(c), the phenol equivalent of 0.25 gram of such food is not more than 3 micrograms.

The total quantity of any such substances, including that contained in the neufchatel cheese, is not more than 0.8 percent by weight of the finished food.

(ii) When one or more of the optional ingredients in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are used, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate complying with the requirements of § 172.810 of this chapter may be used in a quantity not in excess of 0.5 percent by weight of such ingredients.

(4) A sweetening agent consisting of one or a mixture of two or more of the following: Sugar, dextrose, corn sirup, corn sirup solids, glucose sirup, glucose sirup solids, maltose, malt sirup, hydrolyzed lactose.

(5) Cream, milk, skim milk, buttermilk, cheese whey, any of the foregoing from which part of the water has been removed, anhydrous milkfat, dehydrated cream, and albumin from cheese whey.

(c) The name of the food is "pasteurized Neufchatel cheese spread with ______" or "pasteurized Neufchatel cheese spread and ______", the blank being filled in with the common names of the foods added, in order of predominance by weight. The full name of the food shall appear on the principal display panel of the label in type of uniform size, style, and color. Wherever any word or statement emphasizing the name of any ingredient appears on the label (other than in an ingredient statement as specified in paragraph (d) of this section) so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase, the full name of the food shall immediately and conspicuously precede or follow such word or statement in type of at least the same size as the type used in such word or statement.
