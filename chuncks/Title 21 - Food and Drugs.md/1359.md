(a) A party or a prospective witness may file a motion for a protective order with respect to discovery sought by a party or with respect to the hearing, seeking to limit the availability or disclosure of evidence.

(b) When issuing a protective order, the presiding officer may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from oppression or undue burden or expense, or to protect trade secrets or confidential commercial information, as defined in § 20.61 of this chapter, information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or other information that would be withheld from public disclosure under 21 CFR part 20.

(1) That the discovery not be had;

(4) That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of discovery be limited to certain matters;

(5) That the contents of discovery or evidence be sealed;

(6) That the information not be disclosed to the public or be disclosed only in a designated way; or

(7) That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the presiding officer.
