####### Classification.

(b)Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:

(1) The intended use for the device in the labeling required under § 809.10 of this chapter must include a detailed description of the targets the device detects, the type of results provided to the user, the clinical indications appropriate for test use, and the specific population(s) for which the device is intended.

(2) Any device used for specimen collection and transport must be FDA-cleared, approved, or -classified as 510(k) exempt (standalone or as part of a test system) for the collection of the specimen types claimed by this device and for the maintenance of viability of the targeted microorganisms; alternatively, the specimen collection device must be cleared in a premarket submission as a part of this device.

(3) The labeling required under § 809.10(b) of this chapter must include:

(i) A detailed description of the device, including reagents, instruments, ancillary materials, applicable specimen collection and transport device(s) and control elements, and a detailed explanation of the methodology, including all pre-analytical methods for handling and processing of specimens and controls to maintain organism viability;

(ii) Detailed descriptions of the test procedure, including the preparation and maintenance of quality controls and the interpretation of test results;

(iii) Detailed discussion of the performance characteristics of the device for all claimed organisms and specimen types based on analytical studies, including evaluation of analytical sensitivity, inclusivity, cross-reactivity, potentially interfering substances and microorganisms, contamination, specimen stability, precision, and reproducibility;

(iv) Detailed discussion of the performance characteristics of the device observed in a clinical study performed on a population that is consistent with the intended use population in comparison to the results obtained by a reference or comparator method determined to be acceptable by FDA, for microbial detection, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing; and

(v) A limiting statement indicating that a negative test result does not preclude colonization or infection with organisms that do not express detectable levels of the reporter that is identified by the device.

(4) Design verification and validation must include:

(i) A detailed description of the device, including an explanation of the technology, hardware, software, and consumables, as well as an explanation of the result algorithms and method(s) of data processing from signal acquisition to result assignment;

(ii) A detailed description of the impact of any software, including software applications and hardware-based devices that incorporate software, on the device's functions;

(iii) Detailed documentation of the analytical and clinical studies required in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section, including the study protocols containing descriptions of the test methods, prescribed methods of data analysis and acceptance criteria, final study reports, and data line listings;

(iv) Detailed documentation of quality control procedures, including an explanation of how quality control materials were selected, the recommended frequency of testing, methods of control preparation, acceptance criteria for performance and the results from quality control testing performed during the analytical and clinical studies required under paragraphs (b)(3)(iii) and (iv) of this section;

(v) Detailed documentation of studies performed to establish onboard and in-use reagent stability, including the test method(s), data analysis plans, acceptance criteria, final study reports, and data line listings;

(vi) Detailed documentation of studies to establish reagent shelf-life for the assay kit and each applicable specimen collection and transport device, including study protocols containing descriptions of the test method(s), data analysis plans, and acceptance criteria; and

(vii) Documentation of an appropriate end user device training program that will be offered as part of efforts to assure appropriate conduct of the assay and to mitigate the risk associated with false results, including failure to use the device correctly or correctly interpret results.
