(c) In accordance with § 184.1(b)(1), the ingredient is used in food with no limitations other than current good manufacturing practice. The affirmation of this ingredient as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a direct human food ingredient is based upon the following current good manufacturing practice conditions of use:

(1) The ingredient is used as a propellant, aerating agent, and gas as defined in § 170.3(o)(25) of this chapter.

(2) The ingredient is used in dairy product analogs as defined in § 170.3(n)(10) of this chapter at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing practice.
