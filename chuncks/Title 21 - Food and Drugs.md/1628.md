###### § 26.68 Withdrawal of listed conformity assessment bodies.

The following procedures shall apply with regard to the withdrawal from subpart B of this part of a conformity assessment body (CAB):

(a) A party proposing to withdraw a CAB listed in subpart B of this part shall forward its proposal in writing to the other party;

(b) Such CAB shall be promptly notified by the other party and shall be provided a period of at least 30 days from receipt to provide information in order to refute or to correct the deficiencies which form the basis of the proposed withdrawal;

(c) Within 60 days following receipt of the proposal, the other party shall indicate its position regarding either its confirmation or its opposition. Upon confirmation, the withdrawal from the list in subpart B of this part of the CAB shall take effect;

(d) In the event the other party opposes the proposal to withdraw by supporting the technical competence and compliance of the CAB, the CAB shall not at that time be withdrawn from the list of CAB's in subpart B of this part. In this instance, the Joint Sectoral Committee or the Joint Committee may decide to carry out a joint verification of the body concerned. After the completion of such verification, the proposal for withdrawal of the CAB may be resubmitted to the other party; and

(e) Subsequent to the withdrawal of a CAB listed in subpart B of this part, a party shall continue to accept the results of conformity assessment procedures performed by that CAB prior to withdrawal, unless a regulatory authority of the party decides otherwise based on health, safety, and environmental considerations or failure to satisfy other requirements within the scope of subpart B of this part.
