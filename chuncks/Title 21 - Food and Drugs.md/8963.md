(b) Each manufacturer who ships a container of drug product for which a Medication Guide is required under this part is responsible for ensuring that Medication Guides are available for distribution to patients by either:

(1) Providing Medication Guides in sufficient numbers to distributors, packers, or authorized dispensers to permit the authorized dispenser to provide a Medication Guide to each patient receiving a prescription for the drug product; or

(2) Providing the means to produce Medication Guides in sufficient numbers to distributors, packers, or authorized dispensers to permit the authorized dispenser to provide a Medication Guide to each patient receiving a prescription for the drug product.

(d) The label of each container or package, where the container label is too small, of drug product for which a Medication Guide is required under this part shall instruct the authorized dispenser to provide a Medication Guide to each patient to whom the drug product is dispensed, and shall state how the Medication Guide is provided. These statements shall appear on the label in a prominent and conspicuous manner.

(e) Each authorized dispenser of a prescription drug product for which a Medication Guide is required under this part shall, when the product is dispensed to a patient (or to a patient's agent), provide a Medication Guide directly to each patient (or to the patient's agent) unless an exemption applies under § 208.26.

(f) An authorized dispenser or wholesaler is not subject to section 510 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which requires the registration of producers of drugs and the listing of drugs in commercial distribution, solely because of an act performed by the authorized dispenser or wholesaler under this part.
