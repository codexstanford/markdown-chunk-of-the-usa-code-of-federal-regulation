###### § 80.32 Limitations of certificates.

(a) If a certificate is obtained through fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact, such certificate shall not be effective, and a color additive from the batch on which such certificate was issued shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations in this part. Whenever, the Commissioner learns that any certificate has been obtained through fraud or material misrepresentation, he shall notify the holder of the certificate that it is of no effect.

(b) If between the time a sample of color additive accompanying a request for certification is taken and the time a certificate covering the batch of such color additive is received by the person to whom it is issued, any such color additive becomes changed in composition, such certificates shall not be effective with respect to such changed color additive and such changed color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations in this part.

(c) If at any time after a certificate is received by the person to whom it is issued any color additive from the batch covered by such certificate becomes changed in composition, such certificate shall expire with respect to such changed color additive. After such expiration, such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance with this part; except that such color additive shall not be so considered when used for coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic, or for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such color additive was used as an ingredient, or for use in preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from certification has been authorized, if such change resulted solely from such use.

(d) A certificate shall expire with respect to any color additive covered thereby if the package in which such color additive was closed for shipment or delivery is opened. After such expiration such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified, except that such color additive shall not be so considered when the package is opened;

(1) and such color additive is used, subject to the restrictions prescribed by paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, in coloring a food, drug, or cosmetic;

(2) for the purpose of certifying a batch made by repacking such color;

(3) for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such color is used as an ingredient; or

(4) for the purpose of preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from certification has been authorized; or

(5) when the package is reopened solely for repackaging by the person to whom such certificate was issued.

(e) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if such package is shipped or delivered under a label which does not bear all words, statements, and other information required by § 70.25 of this chapter to appear thereon.

(f) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive, and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if:

(1) Such package has not been sealed in accordance with § 70.20 of this chapter.

(2) Such package has been sealed in accordance with § 70.20 of this chapter and the seal has been broken, intentionally or accidentally, unless such seal has been broken for the purpose of using color additive in accordance with § 80.38, or, such package has been opened by a duly authorized representative of the Administration or Department in the performance of his official duties, and he has immediately resealed the package in conformance with § 70.20 of this chapter.

(g) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been certified if such color additive is used in any manner other than that for which it was certified.

(h) When the listing or the specifications for a color additive are revoked or amended, the final order effecting the revocation or amendment may specify, in addition to its own effective date, a date on which all certificates for existing batches and portions of batches of such a color additive theretofore issued under such revoked or amended regulations shall cease to be effective; and any such lots of the color additive shall be regarded as uncertified after the date specified unless a new certificate can be and is obtained in conformance with the new regulations. When a certificate thus ceases to be effective for a color additive, any certificates previously issued for a color additive mixture containing that color additive shall cease to be effective on the same date. Use of such color additive or color additive mixture after such specified date without the new certificate in preparing foods, drugs, or cosmetics will result in such food, drugs, or cosmetics being adulterated. When a certified color additive has been used in food, drugs, or cosmetics and the status of the color additive is thereafter changed by amendment or revocation of its listing or specification regulations, such food, drugs, and cosmetics will not be regarded as adulterated by reason of the use of such color additive, unless the hazard to health is such that existing stocks of the foods, drugs, or cosmetics cannot be safely used, in which cases findings to that effect will be made and regulations appropriate for such special cases will be issued.
