###### § 803.56 If I am a manufacturer, in what circumstances must I submit a supplemental or followup report and what are the requirements for such reports?

If you are a manufacturer, when you obtain information required under this part that you did not provide because it was not known or was not available when you submitted the initial report, you must submit the supplemental information to us within 30 calendar days of the day that you receive this information. You must submit the supplemental or followup report in accordance with the requirements of § 803.12(a). On a supplemental or followup report, you must:

(a) Indicate that the report being submitted is a supplemental or followup report;

(b) Submit the appropriate identification numbers of the report that you are updating with the supplemental information (e.g., your original manufacturer report number and the user facility or importer report number of any report on which your report was based), if applicable; and

(c) Include only the new, changed, or corrected information.
