(b) The failure to comply with any regulation in this subpart in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of an infant formula shall render such infant formula adulterated under section 412(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 350a(a)(3)); the failure to comply with any regulation in part 113 of this chapter in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a liquid infant formula shall render such infant formula adulterated under section 412(a)(3); and the failure to comply with any regulation in part 114 of this chapter in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of an infant formula that is an acidified food shall render such infant formula adulterated under section 412(a)(3).
