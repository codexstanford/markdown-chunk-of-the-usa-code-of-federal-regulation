###### § 20.54 Request for review without copying.

(a) A person requesting disclosure of records shall be permitted an opportunity to review them without the necessity for copying them where the records involved contain only disclosable data and information. Under these circumstances, the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the costs of searching for the records.

(b) Where a request is made for review of records without copying, and the records involved contain both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the records containing nondisclosable information shall first be copied with the nondisclosable information blocked out and the Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of searching and copying.
