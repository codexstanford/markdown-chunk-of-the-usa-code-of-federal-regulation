(a) Except as provided by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a shipment or other delivery of a drug which is, in accordance with the practice of the trade, to be processed, labeled, or repacked in substantial quantity at an establishment other than that where originally processed or packed, shall be exempt, during the time of introduction into and movement in interstate commerce and the time of holding in such establishment, from compliance with the labeling and packaging requirements of sections 501(b) and 502 (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of the act if:

(1) The person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce is the operator of the establishment where such drug is to be processed, labeled, or repacked; or

(2) In case such person is not such operator, such shipment or delivery is made to such establishment under a written agreement, signed by and containing the post-office addresses of such person and such operator, and containing such specifications for the processing, labeling, or repacking, as the case may be, of such drug in such establishment as will insure, if such specifications are followed, that such drug will not be adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act upon completion of such processing, labeling, or repacking. Such person and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until 2 years after the final shipment or delivery of such drug from such establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who requests them.

(c) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a drug under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall become void ab initio with respect to the person who introduced such shipment or delivery into interstate commerce upon refusal by such person to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by such paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(d) An exemption of a shipment or other delivery of a drug under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall expire:

(1) At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the drug comprising such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or

(2) Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such drug is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by such clause.
