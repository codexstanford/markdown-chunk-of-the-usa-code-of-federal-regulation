(2) Has failed to comply with the standards of § 900.12;

(4) Has refused a reasonable request of a duly designated FDA inspector, State inspector, or accreditation body representative for permission to inspect the facility or the operations and pertinent records of the facility;

(6) Has failed to comply with prior sanctions imposed by the agency under 42 U.S.C. 263b(h).

(1) The failure to comply with required standards presents a serious risk to human health;

(2) The refusal to permit inspection makes immediate suspension necessary; or

(3) There is reason to believe that the violation or aiding and abetting of the violation was intentional or associated with fraud.

(1) The agency shall provide the facility with an opportunity for an informal hearing under part 16 of this chapter not later than 60 days from the effective date of this suspension;

(iii) The facility's certificate is revoked in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section;

(d) After providing a hearing in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the agency may revoke the facility's certificate if the agency determines that the facility:
