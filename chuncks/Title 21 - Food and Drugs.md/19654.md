###### § 822.20 What are the consequences if I fail to submit a postmarket surveillance plan, my plan is disapproved and I fail to submit a new plan, or I fail to conduct surveillance in accordance with my approved plan?

The failure to have an approved postmarket surveillance plan or failure to conduct postmarket surveillance in accordance with the approved plan constitutes failure to comply with section 522 of the act. Your failure would be a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(C) of the act, and your device would be misbranded under section 502(t)(3) of the act. We have the authority to initiate actions against products that are adulterated or misbranded, and against persons who commit prohibited acts. Adulterated or misbranded devices can be seized. Persons who commit prohibited acts can be enjoined from committing such acts, required to pay civil money penalties, or prosecuted.
