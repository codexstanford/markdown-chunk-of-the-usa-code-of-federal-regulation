##### Subpart D - FDA Action on Submissions, Requests, and Applications
###### § 99.305 Exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application.

(a) Within 60 days after receipt of an application for an exemption from the requirement of a supplemental application, FDA shall approve or deny the application.

(1) If FDA does not act on the application for an exemption within the 60-day period, the application for an exemption shall be deemed to be approved.

(2) If an application for an exemption is deemed to be approved, FDA may, at any time, terminate such approval if it determines that the requirements for granting an exemption have not been met. FDA shall notify the manufacturer if the approval is terminated.

(b) In reviewing an application for an exemption, FDA shall consider the materials submitted by the manufacturer and may consider any other appropriate information, including, but not limited to, any pending or previously approved applications for exemption submitted by the manufacturer.

(c) FDA may grant an application for an exemption if FDA determines that:

(1) It would be economically prohibitive for the manufacturer to incur the costs necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new use, which at a minimum requires:

(i) That existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and

(ii) That the cost of the study or studies for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the cost of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to the new use of the product, and there are not less expensive ways to obtain the needed information; or

(2) It would be unethical to conduct clinical studies needed to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use because:

(i) Existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and

(ii) Although available evidence would not support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects and no studies in different populations or of modified design can be utilized. In determining whether it would be unethical to conduct clinical studies, the agency shall consider, in addition to the persuasiveness of available evidence of effectiveness, whether the new use of the drug or device is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or therapy.
