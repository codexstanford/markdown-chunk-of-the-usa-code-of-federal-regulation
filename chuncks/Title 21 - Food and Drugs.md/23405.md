####### Classification.

(b)Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:

(1) The patient-contacting components of the device must be demonstrated to be biocompatible;

(2) Device components that are labeled sterile must be validated to a sterility assurance level of 10;

(3) Performance data must support shelf life by demonstrating continued sterility of the device or the sterile components, package integrity, and device functionality over the intended shelf life;

(4) Non-clinical performance data must demonstrate that the device meets all design specifications and performance requirements. The following performance characteristics must be tested:

(i) Demonstration of the device impermeability to tissue, cells, and fluids;

(ii) Demonstration that the device allows for the insertion and withdrawal of laparoscopic instruments while maintaining pneumoperitoneum;

(iii) Demonstration that the containment system provides adequate space to perform morcellation and adequate visualization of the laparoscopic instruments and tissue specimen relative to the external viscera;

(iv) Demonstration that intended laparoscopic instruments and morcellators do not compromise the integrity of the containment system; and

(v) Demonstration that intended users can adequately deploy the device, morcellate a specimen without compromising the integrity of the device, and remove the device without spillage of contents;

(5) Training must be developed and validated to ensure users can follow the instructions for use; and

(6) Labeling must include the following:

(i) A contraindication for use in gynecologic surgery in which the tissue to be morcellated is known or suspected to contain malignancy;

(ii) Unless clinical performance data demonstrates that it can be removed or modified, a contraindication for removal of uterine tissue containing suspected fibroids in patients who are: Peri- or postmenopausal, or candidates for en bloc tissue removal, for example, through the vagina or via a mini-laparotomy incision;

(iii) The following boxed warning: "Warning: Information regarding the potential risks of a procedure with this device should be shared with patients. Uterine tissue may contain unsuspected cancer. The use of laparoscopic power morcellators during fibroid surgery may spread cancer. The use of this containment system has not been clinically demonstrated to reduce this risk."

(iv) A statement limiting use of device to physicians who have completed the training program; and

(v) An expiration date or shelf life.
