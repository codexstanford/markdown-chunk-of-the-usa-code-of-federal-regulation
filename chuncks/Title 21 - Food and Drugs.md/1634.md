(b) Nothing in this part shall be construed to limit the authority of a regulatory authority to take all appropriate and immediate measures whenever it ascertains that a product may:

(1) Compromise the health or safety of persons in its territory;

(2) Not meet the legislative, regulatory, or administrative provisions within the scope of the applicable subpart A or B of this part; or
