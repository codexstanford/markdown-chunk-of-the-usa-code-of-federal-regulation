##### § 1301.17 Special procedures for certain applications.

(a) If, at the time of application for registration of a new pharmacy, the pharmacy has been issued a license from the appropriate State licensing agency, the applicant may include with his/her application an affidavit as to the existence of the State license in the following form:

(b) Whenever the ownership of a pharmacy is being transferred from one person to another, if the transferee owns at least one other pharmacy licensed in the same State as the one the ownership of which is being transferred, the transferee may apply for registration prior to the date of transfer. The Administrator may register the applicant and authorize him to obtain controlled substances at the time of transfer. Such registration shall not authorize the transferee to dispense controlled substances until the pharmacy has been issued a valid State license. The transferee shall include with his/her application the following affidavit:

This statement is submitted in order to obtain a Drug Enforcement Administration registration number.

(c) If at the time of application for a separate registration at a long term care facility, the retail pharmacy has been issued a license, permit, or other form of authorization from the appropriate State agency to install and operate an automated dispensing system for the dispensing of controlled substances at the long term care facility, the applicant must include with his/her application for registration (DEA Form 224) an affidavit as to the existence of the State authorization. Exact language for this affidavit may be found at the DEA Diversion Control Program Web site. The affidavit must include the following information:

(1) The name and title of the corporate officer or official signing the affidavit;

(2) The name of the corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship operating the retail pharmacy;

(3) The name and complete address (including city, state, and Zip code) of the retail pharmacy;

(4) The name and complete address (including city, state, and Zip code) of the long term care facility at which DEA registration is sought;

(5) Certification that the named retail pharmacy has been authorized by the state Board of Pharmacy or licensing agency to install and operate an automated dispensing system for the dispensing of controlled substances at the named long term care facility (including the license or permit number, if applicable);

(6) The date on which the authorization was issued;

(7) Statements attesting to the following:

(i) The affidavit is submitted to obtain a Drug Enforcement Administration registration number;

(ii) If any material information is false, the Administrator may commence proceedings to deny the application under section 304 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a));

(iii) Any false or fraudulent material information contained in this affidavit may subject the person signing this affidavit and the above-named corporation/partnership/business to prosecution under section 403 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 843);

(8) Signature of the person authorized to sign the Application for Registration for the named retail pharmacy;

(9) Notarization of the affidavit.

(d) The Administrator shall follow the normal procedures for approving an application to verify the statements in the affidavit. If the statements prove to be false, the Administrator may revoke the registration on the basis of section 304(a)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)(1)) and suspend the registration immediately by pending revocation on the basis of section 304(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(d)). At the same time, the Administrator may seize and place under seal all controlled substances possessed by the applicant under section 304(f) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 824(f)). Intentional misuse of the affidavit procedure may subject the applicant to prosecution for fraud under section 403(a)(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 843(a)(4)), and obtaining controlled substances through registration by fraudulent means may subject the applicant to prosecution under section 403(a)(3) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 843(a)(3)). The penalties for conviction of either offense include imprisonment for up to 4 years, a fine not exceeding $30,000 or both.
