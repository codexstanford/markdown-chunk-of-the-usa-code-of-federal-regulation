## Chapter I - Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services
### Subchapter A - General
#### PART 17 - CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES HEARINGS
##### § 17.51 Judicial review.

(a) The final decision of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs or other entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) constitutes final agency action from which a respondent may petition for judicial review under the statutes governing the matter involved. Although the filing of a petition for judicial review does not stay a decision under this part, a respondent may file a petition for stay of such decision under § 10.35 of this chapter.

(b) The Chief Counsel of FDA has been designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as the officer on whom copies of petitions for judicial review are to be served. This officer is responsible for filing the record on which the final decision is based. The record of the proceeding is certified by the entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB).

(c) Exhaustion of an appeal to the entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) is a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review.
