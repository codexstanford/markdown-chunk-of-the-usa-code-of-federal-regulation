####### Identification.

(a)Epstein-Barr virus serological reagents are devices that consist of antigens and antisera used in serological tests to identify antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus in serum. The identification aids in the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infections and provides epidemiological information on diseases caused by these viruses. Epstein-Barr viruses are thought to cause infectious mononucleosis and have been associated with Burkitt's lymphoma (a tumor of the jaw in African children and young adults) and postnasal carcinoma (cancer).
