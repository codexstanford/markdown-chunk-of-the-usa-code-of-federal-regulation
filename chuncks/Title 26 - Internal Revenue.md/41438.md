####### Facts.

(1)USP, a domestic corporation, owns all the one class of stock of CFC, a controlled foreign corporation. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year and the functional currency of CFC is the U.S. dollar. All of CFC's earnings and profits of $80x for Year 1 (after payment of foreign income taxes of $20x on its total income of $100x for such year) are attributable to amounts required under section 951(a) to be included in USP's gross income for Year 1 because such income is general category foreign base company services income of CFC. For Year 1, USP chooses to claim a foreign tax credit for the $20x of foreign income taxes which for such year are paid by CFC and deemed paid by USP under section 960(a) and § 1.960-2(b). In Year 2, CFC distributes the entire $80x of Year 1 previously taxed earnings and profits, from which a foreign income tax of $8x is withheld. Also in Year 2, CFC pays $40x of interest to USP, from which a foreign income tax of $4x is withheld. For Year 2, USP chooses to claim deductions for its creditable foreign income taxes under section 164 rather than a foreign tax credit under section 901.
