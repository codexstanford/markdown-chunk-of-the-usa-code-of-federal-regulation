(3) Upon certification by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to the Commissioner that such an amount of the earnings or profits has been so devoted by such affiliate during the taxable year

(b) Every taxpayer claiming a deduction provided for in section 601 shall attach to its return a supplementary statement setting forth all the facts and information upon which the claim is predicated, including such facts and information as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System may prescribe as necessary to enable it, upon the request of the Commissioner subsequent to the filing of the return, to certify to the Commissioner the amount of earnings or profits devoted to the acquisition of such readily marketable assets. A certified copy of such supplementary statement shall be forwarded by the taxpayer to the Board of Governors at the time of the filing of the return. The holding company affiliate shall also furnish the Board of Governors such further information as the Board shall require.
