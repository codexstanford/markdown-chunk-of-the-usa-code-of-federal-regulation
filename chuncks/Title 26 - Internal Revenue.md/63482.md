####### Mortality component.

(2)The mortality component reflects the mortality data most recently available from the United States census. As new mortality data becomes available after each decennial census, the mortality component described in this section will be revised and the revised mortality component tables will be published in the regulations at that time. For gifts with valuation dates on or after May 1, 2009, the mortality component table (Table 2000CM) is contained in § 20.2031-7(d)(7). See § 20.2031-7A of this chapter for mortality component tables applicable to gifts for which the valuation date falls before May 1, 2009.
