###### § 1.1052-2 Basis of property established by Revenue Act of 1934.

Section 1052(b) provides that if property was acquired after February 28, 1913, in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1936, and the basis of the property for the purposes of the Revenue Act of 1934 (48 Stat. 683) was prescribed by section 113(a) (6), (7), or (8) of that act, then for purposes of subtitle A of the Code, the basis shall be the same as the basis prescribed in the Revenue Act of 1934. For example, if after December 31, 1920, and in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1936, property was acquired by a corporation by the issuance of its stock or securities in connection with a transaction which is not described in section 112(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 but which is described in section 112(b)(5) of the Revenue Act of 1934, the basis of the property so acquired shall be the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor, with proper adjustments to the date of the exchange.
