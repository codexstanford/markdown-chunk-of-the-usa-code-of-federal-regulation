###### § 1.643(a)-4 Extraordinary dividends and taxable stock dividends.

In the case solely of a trust which qualifies under subpart B (section 651 and following) as a "simple trust," there are excluded from distributable net income extraordinary dividends (whether paid in cash or in kind) or taxable stock dividends which are not distributed or credited to a beneficiary because the fiduciary in good faith determines that under the terms of the governing instrument and applicable local law such dividends are allocable to corpus. See section 665(e), paragraph (b) of § 1.665(e)-1, and paragraph (b) of § 1.665(e)-1A for the treatment of such dividends upon subsequent distribution.
