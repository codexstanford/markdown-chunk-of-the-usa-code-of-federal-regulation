###### § 1.1337-1 Determination of tax benefits from allowable deductions.

(a) That part of the aggregate of the deductions allowed a taxpayer for any taxable year on account of war losses under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which, if disallowed, would not result in an increase in the normal tax, surtax (including the tax imposed by section 102 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), or victory tax of taxpayer, or of any tax imposed in lieu of such taxes or of any tax imposed by chapter 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, for the taxable year in which such deductions are allowed or in any other taxable year, such as a taxable year in which the taxpayer's income tax is computed by reference to a carryover or carryback of net operating losses from the taxable year in which such deductions are allowed, is considered, for the purposes of section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 an allowable deduction for the taxable year which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In the case of recoveries of war losses and other items to which the recovery exclusion provisions of section 111 apply, such as bad debts, the determination of the tax benefit should be made in accordance with section 111(b) and the regulations thereunder. The deductions allowed a taxpayer for any taxable year on account of war losses are all the deductions on account of war losses which were claimed by the taxpayer in a return, in a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, or in a petition to The Tax Court of the United States with respect to such taxable year and which were not disallowed, and all deductions on account of war losses which, although not so claimed by the taxpayer, were nevertheless allowed (for example, by the Commissioner, a court, or The Tax Court) in computing a tax of the taxpayer.

(b) Any deduction allowable for a taxable year on account of a war loss under section 127(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 which was not claimed by the taxpayer for such year in a return, a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment, or a petition to the Tax Court of the United States and was not allowed as a deduction (for example, by the Commissioner, a court, or the Tax Court) in computing his tax for such year or for any other year is considered a deduction which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, since it is an allowable deduction which was not allowed in computing any tax of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer claimed for any taxable year a deduction on account of a war loss, and if such deduction was disallowed, the taxpayer may not subsequently contend for the purposes of section 1331 that such deduction was an allowable deduction for such taxable year.

(c) If the taxpayer elected under section 127(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 to decrease the amount of a war loss by treating the obligations and liabilities described in that section as discharged or satisfied out of the property destroyed or seized, and if the taxpayer establishes that any of the obligations and liabilities were not so discharged or satisfied, then the amount by which such continuing obligations and liabilities decreased the war loss shall be considered an allowable deduction for the taxable year in which the war loss was sustained which did not result in a reduction of any tax of the taxpayer under chapter 1 or 2 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
