(c) Statements setting forth the information (required by paragraph (b) of this section) shall be demanded not later than 30 days after the close of the corporation's taxable year as follows:

(1) In the case of a corporation having 2,000 or more record owners of its stock on any dividend record date, from each record holder of 5 percent or more of its stock; or

(2) In the case of a corporation having less than 2,000 and more than 200 record owners of its stock, on any dividend record date, from each record holder of 1 percent or more of its stock; or

(3) In the case of a corporation having 200 or less record owners of its stock, on any dividend record date, from each record holder of one-half of 1 percent or more of its stock.
