(a) The Administrator is authorized, under paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Act, when he determines it would effectuate the purposes of the Act, to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized territory in developing and administering the poultry product inspection program of such jurisdiction, with a view to assuring that it imposes and enforces requirements at least equal to those under sections 2 through 4, 6 through 10, and 12 through 22 of the Act, with respect to establishments at which poultry are slaughtered or poultry products are processed for use as human food, solely for distribution within such jurisdiction, and with respect to the poultry products of such establishments. Such cooperation is authorized if the jurisdiction has enacted a mandatory law imposing ante mortem and post mortem inspection, reinspection, and sanitation requirements (at least equal to those under the Federal Act), with respect to all or certain classes of persons engaged in slaughtering poultry or otherwise processing poultry products for use as human food solely for distribution within such jurisdiction.

(b) The Administrator is also authorized under paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Act, to cooperate with any State (including Puerto Rico) or any organized territory in developing and administering programs under the laws of such jurisdiction containing authorities at least equal to those provided in section 11 of the Act (relating to records; registration of specified classes of operators; dead, dying, disabled, or diseased poultry; and products not intended for human food) when he determines that such cooperation would effectuate the purposes of the Act.

(c) Such cooperation may include advisory assistance, technical and laboratory assistance and training, and financial aid. The Federal contribution to any State (or territory) for any year shall not exceed 50 percent of the estimated total cost of the cooperative State (or territorial) program. A cooperative program under this section is called a State-Federal program.
