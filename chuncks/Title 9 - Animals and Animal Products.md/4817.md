(iii) All persons performing poultry disease diagnostic services within the State are required to report to the Official State Agency, within 24 hours, the source of all table-egg layer and table-egg layer pullet specimens that were deemed positive on an official test for avian influenza, as designated in § 146.13(a) of this chapter;

(iv) All table-egg layer and table-egg layer pullet specimens that were deemed positive on an official test for avian influenza, as designated in § 146.13(a) of this chapter, are sent to an authorized laboratory for subtyping; and
