All condemned carcasses, or parts of carcasses, shall be disposed of by one of the following methods, under the supervision of an inspector of the Inspection Service: (Facilities and materials for carrying out the requirements in this section shall be furnished by the official establishment.)

(a) Steam treatment (which shall be accomplished by processing the condemned product in a pressure tank under at least 40 pounds of steam pressure) or thorough cooking in a kettle or vat for a sufficient time to effectively destroy the product for human food purposes and preclude dissemination of disease through consumption by animals. Tanks and equipment used for this purpose or for rendering or preparing inedible products shall be in rooms or compartments separate from those used for the preparation of edible products. There shall be no direct connection, by means of pipes or otherwise, between tanks containing inedible products and those containing edible products.

(b) Incineration or complete destruction by burning.

(c) Chemical denaturing, which shall be accomplished by the liberal application to all carcasses and parts thereof, of:

(1) Crude carbolic acid,

(2) Kerosene, fuel oil, or used crank case oil,

(3) Any phenolic disinfectant conforming to commercial standards CS 70-41 or CS 71-41 which shall be used in at least 2 percent emulsion or solution, or

(4) Any other substance that the Administrator approves which will decharacterize the carcasses or parts to the extent necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section.
