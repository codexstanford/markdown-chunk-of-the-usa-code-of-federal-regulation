###### § 381.204 Marking of poultry products offered for entry; official import inspection marks and devices.

(a) Except for products offered for entry from Canada, poultry products which upon reinspection are found to be acceptable for entry into the United States shall be marked with the official inspection legend shown in paragraph (b) of this section. Such inspection legend shall be placed upon such products only after completion of official import inspection and product acceptance.

(b) The official mark for marking poultry products offered for entry as "U.S. inspected and passed" shall be in the following form, and any device approved by the Administrator for applying such mark shall be an official device.

(c) When products are refused entry into the United States, the official mark to be applied to the products refused entry shall be in the following form:

(d) The import warning notice prescribed in § 381.200(c) is an official mark.

(e) The ordering and manufacture of brands shall be in accordance with the provisions contained in § 317.3(c) of the Federal meat inspection regulations.

(f) The inspection legend may be placed on containers of product before completion of official import inspection if the containers are being inspected by an import inspector who reports to an Import Field Office Supervisor, the product is not required to be held at the establishment pending the receipt of laboratory test results; and a written procedure for controlled stamping, submitted by the import establishment and approved by the Director, Import Inspection Division, is on file at the import inspection facility where the inspection is to be performed.

(1) The written procedure for controlled pre-stamping should be in the form of a letter and shall include the following:

(i) That stamping under this subpart will be limited to those lots of product which can be inspected on the day that certificates for the product are examined;

(ii) That all products which have been pre-stamped will be stored in the facility where the import inspection will occur;

(iii) That inspection marks applied under this part will be removed from any lot of product subsequently refused entry on the day the product is rejected; and

(iv) That the establishment will maintain a daily stamping log containing the following information for each lot of product: the date of inspection, the country of origin, the foreign establishment number, the product name, the number of units, the shipping container marks, and the MP-410 number covering the product to be inspected. The daily stamping log must be retained by the establishment in accordance with the requirements of § 381.177.

(2) An official import establishment's controlled pre-stamping privilege may be cancelled orally or in writing by the inspector or other Agency employee who is supervising its enforcement whenever the employee finds that the official import establishment has failed to comply with the provisions of this part or any conditions imposed pursuant thereto. If the cancellation is oral, the decision or action and the reasons therefor will be confirmed in writing, as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose controlled pre-stamping privilege has been cancelled may appeal the decision or action in accordance with 9 CFR 500.9. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the controlled pre-stamping privilege was wrongfully cancelled.
