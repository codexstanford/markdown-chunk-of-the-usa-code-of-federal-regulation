"Leaf Lard" is lard prepared from fresh leaf (abdominal) fat.

(d) Product found upon inspection not to have the characteristics specified in paragraph (c) of this section but found to be otherwise sound and in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section may be further processed for the purpose of achieving such characteristics.
