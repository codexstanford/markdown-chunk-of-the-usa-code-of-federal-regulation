###### Entry of Material Into Official Egg Products Plants
####### § 590.430 Limitation on entry of material.

(a) The Administrator shall limit the entry of eggs and egg products and other materials into official plants under such conditions as he may prescribe to assure that allowing the entry of such articles will be consistent with the purposes of the Act and these regulations.

(b) Inedible egg products may be brought into an official plant for storage, processing, and reshipment provided they are handled in such a manner that adequate segregation and inventory controls are maintained at all times. The processing of inedible egg products must be done under conditions that will not affect the processing of edible products, such as processing in separate areas or at times when no edible products are being processed. If the same equipment or areas are used to process both inedible and edible eggs, then the equipment and processing areas used to process inedible eggs must be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized prior to processing any edible egg products.
