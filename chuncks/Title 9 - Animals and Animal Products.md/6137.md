(1) The operator, or his employee or agent:

(i) Has made any willful misrepresentation or engaged in any fraudulent or deceptive practice in connection with the service;

(ii) Has interfered with or obstructed any Program employee or other inspector in the performance of his duties, under the regulations in this part, by intimidation, threats, or other improper means; or

(iii) Has violated section 203(h) of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1622(h)), or any regulation in this part; or

(2) Facilities or procedures at the certified plant do not conform to the arrangements approved by the Administrator under § 351.5.

(b) Pending final determination of the matter, the Administrator may summarily suspend the certification service at any certified plant when he has reason to believe that there is cause for withdrawal of the service under paragraph (a). The operator of the certified plant shall be notified of the Administrator's decision to suspend summarily the certification service at such plant and the reasons therefor, in writing, in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)), or orally.

If such notification is oral, the Administrator shall confirm such decision, and the reasons therefor, in writing, as promptly as circumstances permit, and such written confirmation shall be served upon the operator of the certified plant, in the manner prescribed in § 1.147(b) of the rules of practice (7 CFR 1.147(b)).
