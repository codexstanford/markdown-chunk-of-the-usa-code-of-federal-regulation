###### § 82.24 Other interstate movements and special permits.

(a) A special permit is required for the interstate movement of items whose movement interstate is restricted under this subpart in a manner or to a destination other than is specifically prescribed by this subpart. A special permit is required for the disinfection of vehicles, premises, cages, coops, containers, troughs, and other equipment by a method other than is specifically prescribed by this subpart. To apply for a special permit, contact the veterinarian in charge for the State in which the items are located. The Administrator may, at his or her discretion, issue special permits if he or she determines the activity authorized will not increase the risk of spreading chlamydiosis interstate.

(ii) The addresses of both the origin and destination of the items;

(iii) The number and type of items to be moved interstate; and

(iv) The reason for the interstate movement.

(2) For cleaning and disinfection, the special permit will also include the following:
