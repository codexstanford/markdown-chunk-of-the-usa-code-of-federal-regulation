(iii) All persons performing poultry disease diagnostic services within the State are required to report to the Official State Agency, within 24 hours, the source of all meat-type turkey specimens that were deemed positive on an official test for avian influenza, as designated in § 146.13(a) of this chapter;

(iv) All meat-type turkey specimens that were deemed positive on an official test for avian influenza, as designated in § 146.13(a) of this chapter, are sent to an authorized laboratory for subtyping; and

(2) If there is a discontinuation of any of the conditions described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, or if repeated outbreaks of the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza occur in meat-type turkey flocks as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, or if an infection spreads from the originating premises, the Service shall have grounds to revoke its determination that the State is entitled to this classification. Such action shall not be taken until a thorough investigation has been made by the Service and the Official State Agency has been given an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with rules of practice adopted by the Administrator.
