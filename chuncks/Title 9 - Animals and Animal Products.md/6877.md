(c) If an establishment is selected to participate in a cooperative interstate shipment program as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the State is to assign the establishment an official number that reflects the establishment's participation in the cooperative interstate shipment program and advise the FSIS selected establishment coordinator for the State of the official number assigned to each selected establishment in the State. The official numbers assigned to every selected establishment must contain a suffix, e.g., "SE," that identifies the establishment as a selected establishment; that includes the letter "P," which identifies the establishment as a poultry establishment; and that identifies the State, e.g., "SEPND," for "selected establishment poultry North Dakota."
