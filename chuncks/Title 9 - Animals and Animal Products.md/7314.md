##### § 532.5 Exemption from definition of fish product of certain human food products containing fish.

The following articles contain fish ingredients only in a relatively small proportion or historically have not been considered by consumers to be products of the fish food products industry. Therefore, the articles are exempted from the definition of "fish product" and the requirements of the Act and the regulations that apply to fish products, if they comply with the conditions specified in this section.

(a) Any human food product if:

(1) It contains less than 3 percent raw or 2 percent cooked fish;

(3) The immediate container of the product bears a label which shows the name of the product in accordance with this section; and

(b) A product exempted under this section will be deemed to be represented as a fish product if the term "fish" or a term representing a fish species that is covered by the definition of "fish" in part 531 of this subchapter is used in the product name of the product without appropriate qualification.

(c) A product exempted under this section is subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
