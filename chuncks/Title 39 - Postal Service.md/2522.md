(a) Interested persons shall be provided an opportunity to comment on the filing of the calculation of the assumed Federal income tax and supporting documentation.

(b) The Commission will review the calculation of the assumed Federal income tax submitted pursuant to § 3060.40, the supporting documentation submitted pursuant to § 3060.41, and any comments. The Commission then will issue an order either approving the calculation of the assumed Federal income tax for that tax year or take such other action as the Commission deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, directing the Postal Service to file additional supporting materials.

(c) The Commission will issue such order no later than 6 months after the Postal Service's filing pursuant to § 3060.40.

(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, if the Commission determines within 3 years of its submission that the Postal Service's calculation of an assumed Federal income tax is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise deficient, the Commission will notify the Postal Service in writing and provide it with an opportunity to cure or otherwise explain the deficiency. Upon receipt of the Postal Service's responsive pleading, the Commission may order such action as it deems appropriate.
