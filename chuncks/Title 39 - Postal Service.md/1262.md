##### § 778.9 How does the Postal Service receive and respond to comments?

(a) The Postal Service follows the procedures in § 778.10 if:

(1) A state office or official is designated to act as a single point of contact between a state process and all federal agencies, and

(2) That office or official transmits a state process recommendation for a facility project action of a category selected under § 778.6.

(b)(1) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit comments from state, areawide, regional or local officials and entities where there is no state process recommendation.

(2) If a state process recommendation is transmitted by a single point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.

(c) If a state has not established a process, or does not submit a state process recommendation, state, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit comments directly to the Postal Service.

(d) If a facility project action is not selected for a state process, state, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit comments directly to the Postal Service. In addition, if a state process recommendation for a nonselected facility project action is transmitted to the Postal Service by the single point of contact, the Postal Service follows the procedures of § 778.10.

(e) The Postal Service considers comments which do not constitute a state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for which the Postal Service is not required to apply the procedures of § 778.10 when such comments are provided by a single point of contact or directly to the Postal Service by a commenting party.
