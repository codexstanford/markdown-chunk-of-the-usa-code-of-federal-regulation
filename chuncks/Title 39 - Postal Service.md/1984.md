###### § 3010.161 Motions for waiver.

(a) Any person may file a motion requesting that any requirement imposed by regulation, order, ruling, or Commission, Chairman, or presiding officer request be waived.

(b) Motions for waiver will not be entertained unless timely filed so as to permit disposition of the motion prior to the date specified for the requirement for which waiver is requested. The pendency of a motion for waiver does not excuse any person from timely meeting the requirement for which the waiver is requested.

(c) Motions for waiver may be granted in whole or in part to the extent permitted by law upon a showing of good cause and that such waiver will be consistent with the public interest and will not unduly prejudice the interests of other participants.
