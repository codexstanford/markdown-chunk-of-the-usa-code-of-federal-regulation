(b) Operation of a radio frequency device prior to equipment authorization is permitted under the authority of an experimental radio service authorization issued under part 5 of this chapter.

(c) Operation of a radio frequency device prior to equipment authorization is permitted for experimentation or compliance testing of a device that is fully contained within an anechoic chamber or a Faraday cage.

(d) For devices designed to operate solely under parts 15, 18, or 95 of this chapter without a station license, operation of a radio frequency device prior to equipment authorization is permitted under the following conditions, so long as devices are either rendered inoperable or retrieved at the conclusion of such operation:

(1) The radio frequency device shall be operated in compliance with existing Commission rules, waivers of such rules that are in effect at the time of operation, or rules that have been adopted by the Commission but that have not yet become effective; and

(ii) Evaluation of performance and determination of customer acceptability, during developmental, design, or pre-production states. If the device is not operated at the manufacturer's facilities, it must be labeled with the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iii), and in the case of an evaluation kit, the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iv)(C).

(e) Operation of a radio frequency device prior to equipment authorization is permitted under either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section so long as devices are either rendered inoperable or retrieved at the conclusion of such operation:

(ii) Evaluation of performance and determination of customer acceptability, during developmental, design, or pre-production states. If the device is not operated at the manufacturer's facilities, it must be labeled with the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iii), and in the case of an evaluation kit, the wording specified in § 2.803(c)(2)(iv)(C).
