Each MURS transmitter type must be designed to meet the applicable frequency tolerance and stability requirements of this section.

(a) MURS transmitters that operate with an emission bandwidth of 6.25 kHz or less must be designed such that the carrier frequencies remain within +/-2.0 parts-per-million (ppm) of the channel center frequencies specified in § 95.2763 during normal operating conditions.

(b) MURS transmitters that operate with an emission bandwidth greater than 6.25 kHz must be designed such that the carrier frequencies remain within +/-5.0 ppm of the channel center frequencies specified in § 95.2763 during normal operating conditions.
