###### § 101.209 Operation of stations at temporary fixed locations for communication between the United States and Canada or Mexico.

Stations authorized to operate at temporary fixed locations may not be used for transmissions between the United States and Canada, or the United States and Mexico, without prior specific notification to, and authorization from, the Commission. Notification of such intended usage of the facilities should include a detailed showing of the operation proposed, including the parties involved, the nature of the communications to be handled, the terms and conditions of such operations, the time and place of operation, such other matters as the applicant deems relevant, and a showing as to how the public interest, convenience and necessity would be served by the proposed operation. Such notification should be given sufficiently in advance of the proposed date of operation to permit any appropriate correlation with the respective foreign government involved (see §§ 101.31, 101.811, 101.813, and 101.815).
