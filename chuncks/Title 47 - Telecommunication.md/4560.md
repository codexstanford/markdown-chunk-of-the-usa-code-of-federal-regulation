####### § 25.124 Unified space station and earth station authorization.

(a) A single authorization may be issued for the operations of a GSO space station or NGSO space station(s) and the blanket-licensed earth stations that will operate within that satellite system, excluding GSO FSS and NGSO FSS satellite systems operating in bands below 10 GHz and bands subject to § 25.136. The available frequency bands are:

(1) Non-Voice, Non-Geostationary MSS: 137-138 MHz, 148-150.05 MHz, 399.9-400.05 MHz, and 400.15-401 MHz;

(2) 1.5/1.6 GHz MSS: 1525-1559 MHz and 1626.5-1660.5 MHz;

(3) 1.6/2.4 GHz MSS: 1610-1626.5 MHz and 2483.5-2500 MHz;

(4) 2 GHz MSS: 2000-2020 MHz and 2180-2200 MHz;

(5) GSO FSS: 10.7-12.2 GHz, 14-14.5 GHz, 18.3-18.8 GHz, 19.7-20.2 GHz, 28.35-28.6 GHz, 29.25-30 GHz, 40-42 GHz, and 48.2-50.2 GHz;

(6) NGSO FSS: 10.7-12.7 GHz, 14-14.5 GHz, 17.8-18.6 GHz, 18.8-19.4 GHz, 19.6-20.2 GHz, 28.35-29.1 GHz, 29.5-30 GHz, 40-42 GHz, and 48.2-50.2 GHz; and

(7) GSO and NGSO MSS: 19.7-20.2 GHz and 29.5-30 GHz.

(b) An application for a satellite system license described in paragraph (a) must contain:

(1) The information required by § 25.114 or, for a non-U.S.-licensed space station, § 25.137;

(2) A certification that earth station operations under the satellite system license will comply with part 1, subpart I and part 17 of this chapter; and

(3) Any additional information required under this part, including under § 25.115, for operation of the blanket-licensed earth stations that is not duplicative or unnecessary due to the information provided for the space station operation.
