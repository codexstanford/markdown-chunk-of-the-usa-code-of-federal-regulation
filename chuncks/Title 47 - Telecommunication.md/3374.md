(a) The provisions of subparts A, B, and C of this part apply to white space devices, except where specific provisions are contained in this subpart.

(b) The requirements of this subpart apply only to the radio transmitter contained in the white space device. Other aspects of the operation of a white space device may be subject to requirements contained elsewhere in this chapter.
