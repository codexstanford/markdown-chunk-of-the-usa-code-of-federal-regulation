###### § 101.1409 Treatment of incumbent licensees.

Terrestrial private operational fixed point-to-point licensees in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band which were licensed prior to MVDDS or NGSO FSS satellite stations are incumbent point-to-point stations and are not entitled to protection from harmful interference caused by later MVDDS or NGSO FSS entrants in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, except for public safety stations which must be protected. MVDDS and NGSO FSS operators have the responsibility of resolving any harmful interference problems that their operations may cause to these public safety incumbent point-to-point operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Incumbent public safety terrestrial point-to-point licensees may only make minor changes to their stations without losing this protection. This does not relieve current point-to-point licensees of their obligation to protect BSS operations in the subject frequency band. All point-to-point applications, including low-power operations, for new licenses, major amendments to pending applications, or major modifications to existing licenses for the 12.2-12.7 GHz band are no longer accepted except for renewals and changes in ownership. See § 1.929 of this chapter for definitions of major and minor changes.
