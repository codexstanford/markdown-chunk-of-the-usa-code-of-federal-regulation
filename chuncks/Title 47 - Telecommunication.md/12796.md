###### § 95.939 External radio frequency power amplifiers prohibited.

The operator of a CBRS station must not use an external radio frequency power amplifier to increase the transmitting power of that CBRS station under any circumstances. There are no exceptions to this rule.

(a) The FCC will presume that the operator of a CBRS station has used an external radio frequency power amplifier in violation of this section if it is in the operator's possession or on the operator's premises and there is other evidence that the CBRS station has been operated with more transmitting power than allowed by § 95.967.

(b) The operator of a CBRS station must not attach an external radio frequency power amplifier to a certified CBRS transmitter.
