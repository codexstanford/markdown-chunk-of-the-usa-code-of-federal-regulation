(i) For channels 511 to 524-the minimum median desired signal levels specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) shall apply;

(ii) For channels 524 to 534-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from the values specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) to -70 dBm;

(iii) For channels 534 to 550-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from -70 dBm to -65 dBm.

(2) Portable units (except in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands):

(i) For channels 511 to 524-the minimum median desired signal levels specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) shall apply;

(ii) For channels 524 to 530-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from the values specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) to -80 dBm;

(iii) For channels 530 to 534-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from -80 dBm to -70 dBm;

(iv) For channels 534 to 550-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from -70 dBm to -65 dBm.

(3) Mobile units operating in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands:

(i) For channels 511 to 530-the minimum median desired signal levels specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) shall apply;

(ii) For channels 531 to 534-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from -80.2 dBm to -70 dBm;

(iii) For channels 534 to 550-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from -70 dBm to -65 dBm.

(4) Portable units operating in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands:

(i) For channels 511 to 530-the minimum median desired signal levels specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) shall apply;

(ii) For channels 531 to 534-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from -80 dBm to -70 dBm;

(iii) For channels 534 to 550-the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from -70 dBm to -65 dBm.

(l) Applicants may begin to license interstitial pool channels (denoted with an "a" after the channel number) listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section only after the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau jointly release a public notice announcing the availability of those channels for licensing in a National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee region.

(m) Incumbent licensees in the 470-512 MHz band in the urban areas specified in § 90.303 of the Commission's rules are given priority access over mutually exclusive applicants for a three-year period to all interstitial channel pairs in the public safety pool or the business/industrial/land transportation pool listed above for which they are eligible, provided that any relocating T-Band incumbent must commit to surrendering an equal amount of 470-512 MHz spectrum on a channel-for-channel basis. The three-year period begins on the date these channel pairs become available for licensing in a National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee region. Priority access applies to any applicant seeking to license a base station within 80 kilometers (50 miles) or mobile units or control stations within 128 kilometers (80 miles) of the geographic center of the urbanized areas listed in § 90.303 of the Commission's rules.
