###### § 54.1808 Reimbursement for providing monthly affordable connectivity benefit.

(2) Shall certify that every subscriber claimed has used their service subject to the affordable connectivity benefit, as "usage" is defined by § 54.407(c)(2), at least once in the last 30 consecutive days or has cured their non-usage as provided in § 54.1809(c), in order to claim that subscriber for reimbursement for a given service month.

(d) A participating provider that, in addition to providing the affordable connectivity benefit to an eligible household, provides such household with a connected device may be reimbursed in the amount and subject to the conditions specified in §§ 54.1803(b) and 54.1806(e).
