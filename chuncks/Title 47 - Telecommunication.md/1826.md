#### PART 1 - PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE
##### Subpart BB - Disturbance of AM Broadcast Station Antenna Patterns
###### § 1.30000 Purpose.

This rule part protects the operations of AM broadcast stations from nearby tower construction that may distort the AM antenna patterns. All parties holding or applying for Commission authorizations that propose to construct or make a significant modification to an antenna tower or support structure in the immediate vicinity of an AM antenna, or propose to install an antenna on an AM tower, are responsible for completing the analysis and notice process described in this subpart, and for taking any measures necessary to correct disturbances of the AM radiation pattern, if such disturbances occur as a result of the tower construction or modification or as a result of the installation of an antenna on an AM tower. In the event these processes are not completed before an antenna structure is constructed, any holder of or applicant for a Commission authorization is responsible for completing these processes before locating or proposing to locate an antenna on the structure, as described in this subpart.
