####### § 25.155 Mutually exclusive applications.

(a) The Commission will consider applications to be mutually exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application would effectively preclude by reason of harmful interference, or other practical reason, the grant of one or more other applications.

(b) A license application for NGSO-like satellite operation, as defined in § 25.157(a), will be entitled to comparative consideration with one or more mutually exclusive applications only if the application is received by the Commission in a condition acceptable for filing by the "cut-off" date specified in a public notice.

(c) A license application for GSO-like satellite operation, as defined in § 25.158(a)(1), will be entitled to comparative consideration with another application only if:

(1) The application is mutually exclusive with another application for GSO-like operation; and

(2) The application is received by the Commission in a condition acceptable for filing at the same millisecond as the other application.
