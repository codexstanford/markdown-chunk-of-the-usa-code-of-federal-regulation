####### Identification code.

(2)An identification code, recognized by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Program Manager for the 406 MHz COSPAS/SARSAT satellite system, must be programmed into each PLB to establish a unique identification for that PLB.

(b) To be certified for use under this subpart, MSLD transmitter types must be designed to satisfy the following additional requirements.

(1) A test report from a test laboratory which shows that the MSLD complies with the electrical and environmental standards associated with RTCM 11901. The test laboratory must be accredited to ISO-IEC 17025 with a scope covering the applicable requirements and test procedures.

(2) After the MSLD has been certified by a test laboratory, the following information must be submitted in duplicate to the U.S. Coast Guard, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE., Stop 7126, Washington, DC 20593-7126:
