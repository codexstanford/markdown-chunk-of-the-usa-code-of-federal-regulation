###### § 95.2533 Prohibited MedRadio uses.

MedRadio Service transmitters must not be operated for uses other than those set forth in § 95.2531.

(a) Voice communications are prohibited in the MedRadio Service.

(b) MedRadio programmer/control transmitters may not be used to relay information in the 401-406 MHz band to a receiver that is not included with a medical implant or medical body-worn device. Wireless retransmission of information intended to be transmitted by a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter or information received from a medical implant or medical body-worn transmitter shall be performed using other radio services that operate in spectrum outside of the 401-406 MHz band.

(c) MedRadio programmer/control transmitters and medical implant transmitters may not be used to relay information in the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, and 451-457 MHz bands to a receiver that is not a part of the same Medical Micropower Network (MMN). Wireless retransmission of information to a receiver that is not part of the same MMN must be performed using other radio services that operate in spectrum outside of the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, and 451-457 MHz bands. Notwithstanding the above restrictions, a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter of an MMN may communicate with a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter of another MMN to coordinate transmissions, so as to avoid interference between the two MMNs.

(d) Medical body-worn transmitters may relay only information in the 2360-2400 MHz band to a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter or another medical body-worn transmitter device that is part of the same Medical Body Area Network (MBAN). A MedRadio programmer/control transmitter must not be used to relay information in the 2360-2400 MHz band to other MedRadio programmer/control transmitters. Wireless retransmission of all other information from an MBAN transmitter to a receiver that is not a part of the same MBAN shall be performed using other radio services that operate in spectrum outside of the 2360-2400 MHz band. Notwithstanding the above restriction, a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter in the 2360-2400 MHz band may communicate with another MedRadio programmer/control transmitter in the 2360-2400 MHz band to coordinate transmissions so as to avoid interference between the two MBANs.

(e) Except as provided in § 95.2559(b), no MedRadio implant or body-worn transmitter shall transmit except in response to-

(1) A transmission from a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter; or

(2) A non-radio frequency actuation signal generated by a device external to the body with respect to which the MedRadio implant or body-worn transmitter is used.
