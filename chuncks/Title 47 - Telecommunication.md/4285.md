###### § 24.135 Frequency stability.

(a) The frequency stability of the transmitter shall be maintained within +/-0.0001 percent (+/-1 ppm) of the center frequency over a temperature variation of -30 &#xB0;Celsius to + 50 &#xB0;Celsius at normal supply voltage, and over a variation in the primary supply voltage of 85 percent to 115 percent of the rated supply voltage at a temperature of 20 &#xB0;Celsius.

(b) For battery operated equipment, the equipment tests shall be performed using a new battery without any further requirement to vary supply voltage.

(c) It is acceptable for a transmitter to meet this frequency stability requirement over a narrower temperature range provided the transmitter ceases to function before it exceeds these frequency stability limits.
