###### § 25.262 Licensing and domestic coordination requirements for 17/24 GHz BSS space stations and FSS space stations transmitting in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band.

(a) A 17/24 GHz BSS or FSS applicant seeking to transmit in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band may be authorized to operate a space station at levels up to the maximum power flux density limits defined in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section without coordinating its power flux density levels with adjacent licensed or permitted operators, as follows:

(1) For 17/24 GHz BSS applicants, up to the power flux density levels specified in § 25.140(b)(3) only if there is no licensed space station, or prior-filed application for a space station transmitting in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band at a location less than four degrees from the orbital location at which the applicant proposes to operate; and

(2) For FSS space station applicants transmitting in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band, up to the maximum power flux density levels in § 25.140(a)(3)(iii), only if there is no licensed 17/24 GHz BSS space station, or prior-filed application for a 17/24 GHz BSS space station, at a location less than four degrees from the orbital location at which the FSS applicant proposes to operate, and there is no licensed FSS space station, or prior-filed application for an FSS space station transmitting in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band, at a location less than two degrees from the orbital location at which the applicant proposes to operate.

(b) Any U.S. licensee or permittee authorized to transmit in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band that does not comply with the applicable power flux-density limits set forth in § 25.140(a)(3)(iii) and/or (b)(3) shall bear the burden of coordinating with any future co-frequency licensees and permittees of a space station transmitting in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band as required in § 25.114(d)(15)(ii).

(c) If no good faith agreement can be reached, the operator of the FSS space station transmitting in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band that does not comply with § 25.140(a)(3)(iii) or the operator of the 17/24 GHz BSS space station that does not comply with § 25.140(b)(3), shall reduce its power flux-density levels to be compliant with those specified in § 25.140(a)(3)(iii) and/or (b)(3) as appropriate.

(d) Any U.S. licensee or permittee of a space station transmitting in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band that is required to provide information in its application pursuant to § 25.140(a)(2) or (b)(4) must accept any increased interference that may result from adjacent space stations transmitting in the 17.3-17.8 GHz band that are operating in compliance with the rules for such space stations specified in §§ 25.140(a) and (b), 25.202(a)(9) and (e) through (g), 25.210(i) through (j), 25.224, 25.262, 25.264(h), and 25.273(a)(3).

(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, licensees and permittees will be allowed to apply for a license or authorization for a replacement satellite that will be operated at the same power level and interference protection as the satellite to be replaced.
