The time in which an item of telephone plant is in actual use either by a customer or an operator. For example, on a completed telephone call, holding time includes conversation time as well as other time in use. At local dial offices any measured minutes which result from other than customer attempts to place calls (as evidenced by the dialing of at least one digit) are not treated as holding time.

An electronic analog or digital base switching unit containing the central call processing functions which service the host office and its remote locations.

Equipment used to input into or receive output from the telecommunications network.

A circuit which is included in the interexchange transmission equipment.

The combination of (a) interexchange cable and wire facilities, (b) interexchange circuit equipment and, (c) associated land and buildings.

A circuit between two local central office units, either manual or dial. Interlocal trunks may be used for either exchange or toll traffic or both.

Circuits between toll centers and circuits between a toll center and a tandem system in a different toll center area.

The portion of a private line circuit which is included in the exchange transmission plant. However, common usage of this term usually excludes information origination/termination equipment.

A central office serving primarily as a place of termination for subscriber lines and for providing telephone service to the subscribers on these lines.

A pair of wires, or its equivalent, between a customer's station and the central office from which the station is served.

A completed call, i.e., a communication in which a conversation or exchange of information took place between the calling and called parties.

Switched service furnished to the general public (as distinguished from private line service). Except as otherwise provided, this includes exchange switched services and all switched services provided by interexchange carriers and completed by a local telephone company's access services, e.g., MTS, WATS, Execunet, open-end FX and CCSA/ONALs.

Unit of measurement used for charging for measured message telephone exchange traffic within a specified area.

The area around and including a relatively large city and in which substantially all of the message telephone traffic between the city and the suburban points within the area is classified as exchange in one or both directions.

A unit of measurement expressed as either holding time or conversation time.

The product of (a) the number of minutes-of-use and (b) the average route kilometers of circuits involved.

An exchange area in which are located two or more local central office buildings or wire centers.

The term denoting the general classifications of services rendered to the public for which separate tariffs are filed, namely exchange, state toll and interstate toll.

A general term, ordinarily applied to trunks between manually operated switchboard positions and local dial central offices in the same wire center.

A service for communications between specified locations for a continuous period or for regularly recurring periods at stated hours.

An access line (e.g., for WATS service) between a subscriber's premises in one toll rate center and a serving central office located in a different toll rate center.

A remotely located subscriber line access unit which is normally dependent upon the central processor of the host office for call processing functions.

Arrangement that permits the extension of TSPS functions to remote locations.

That amount or quantity of property kept or set apart for a specific use.

Kept or set apart for a specific use.

The process by which telecommunication property costs, revenues, expenses, taxes and reserves are apportioned among the operations.

A unit of work measurement which is used as the common denominator to express the relative time required for handling the various work functions at service observing boards.

The actual length of cable in route kilometers.

All services other than message telephones, e.g., private line services.

The term applied to the basis of toll rate making which contemplates that the message toll service charge (telephone) covers the use made of all facilities between the originating station and the terminating station, including the stations, and the services rendered in connection therewith.

The general areas served by the local offices having direct trunks to or from the tandem office. This area may consist of one or more communities or may include only a portion of a relatively large city.

A general classification of circuits or trunks between a tandem central office unit and any other central office or switchboard.

A call switched at a tandem office.

An office (or group of offices) within a city which generally handles the originating and incoming toll traffic for that city to or from other toll center areas and which handles through switched traffic.

A local office which is located outside the exchange in which a toll center is located, which has a different rate center from its toll center and which usually tickets and times only a part of its originating toll traffic, but which may ticket or time all or none, of such traffic. The toll center handles all outward traffic not ticketed and timed at the tributary and normally switches all inward toll traffic from outside the tributary's toll center to the tributary. Tributary offices are indicated as such in the Toll Rate and Route Guide.
