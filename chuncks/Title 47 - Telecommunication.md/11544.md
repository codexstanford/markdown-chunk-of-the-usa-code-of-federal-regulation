###### § 80.863 Antenna system.

(a) An antenna system must be installed which is as nondirectional and as efficient as is practicable for the transmission and reception of radio ground waves over seawater. The installation and construction of the required antenna must insure operation in time of emergency.

(b) If the required antenna is suspended between masts or other supports liable to whipping, a safety link which, under heavy stress, will operate to greatly reduce such stress without breakage of the antenna, the halyards, or other antenna-supporting elements, must be installed.

(c) When an electrical ground connection is used as an element of the antenna system, the connection must be efficient.
