###### § 68.414 Hearing aid-compatibility: Enforcement.

Enforcement of §§ 68.4 and 68.112 is hereby delegated to those states which adopt those sections and provide for their enforcement. The procedures followed by a state to enforce those sections shall provide a 30-day period after a complaint is filed, during which time state personnel shall attempt to resolve a dispute on an informal basis. If a state has not adopted or incorporated §§ 68.4 and 68.112, or failed to act within 6 months from the filing of a complaint with the state public utility commission, the Commission will accept such complaints. A written notification to the complainant that the state believes action is unwarranted is not a failure to act.
