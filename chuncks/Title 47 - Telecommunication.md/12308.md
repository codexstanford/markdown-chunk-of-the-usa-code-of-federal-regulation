###### Internal Transmitter Control Systems
####### § 90.475 Operation of internal transmitter control systems in specially equipped systems.
######## i.e.

(2) An internal transmitter control system may be used in conjunction with other approved methods of transmitter control and interconnection so long as the internal transmitter control system, itself, is neither accessed from telephone positions in the public switched telephone network (PSTN), nor uses dial-up circuits in the PSTN. Licensees with complex communications systems involving fixed systems whose base stations are controlled by such systems may automatically access these base stations through the microwave or operational fixed systems from positions in the PSTN, so long as the base stations and mobile units meet the requirements of § 90.483 and if a separate circuit is provided for each mode of transmitter operation (, conventional, dial-up or Internet).

(3) The system must be designed so that upon completion of a transmission, the base station transmitter(s) will close down automatically within 3 seconds.

(4) To guard against malfunctions, the system must also be designed so that the base station(s) will be deactivated by an automatic timing device when a modulated signal is not transmitted for a period of three (3) consecutive minutes.

(5) The system must include automatic monitoring equipment, installed at the base station transmitter site(s), which will prevent the activation of the system when signals of other co-channel stations are present.

(b) [Reserved]
