###### § 65.305 Calculation of the weighted average cost of capital.

(a) The composite weighted average cost of capital is the sum of the cost of debt, the cost of preferred stock, and the cost of equity, each weighted by its proportion in the capital structure of the telephone companies.

(b) Unless the Commission determines to the contrary in a prescription proceeding, the composite weighted average cost of debt and cost of preferred stock is the composite weight computed in accordance with § 65.304 multiplied by the composite cost of the component computed in accordance with § 65.301 or § 65.302, as applicable. The composite weighted average cost of equity will be determined in each prescription proceeding.
