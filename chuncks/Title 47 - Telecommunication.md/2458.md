###### § 5.65 Defective applications.

(a) Applications that are defective with respect to completeness of answers to required questions, execution or other matters of a purely formal character may be found to be unacceptable for filing by the Commission, and may be returned to the applicant with a brief statement as to the omissions.

(b) If an applicant is requested by the Commission to file any documents or information not included in the prescribed application form, failure to comply with such request will constitute a defect in the application.

(c) Applications not in accordance with the Commission's rules, regulations, or other requirements will be considered defective unless accompanied either by:

(1) A petition to amend any rule, regulation, or requirement with which the application is in conflict; or

(2) A request for waiver of any rule, regulation, or requirement with which the application is in conflict. Such request shall show the nature of the waiver desired and set forth the reasons in support thereof.
