(iii) Was not, after the date of the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, subject to a mandatory waiting period for such internet service offering based on having previously received broadband internet access service from such participating provider; and

(14) The officer is aware that any false, fictitious, or fraudulent information, or the omission of any material fact, may subject the officer to criminal, civil, or administrative penalties for fraud, false statements, false claims, or otherwise. (18 U.S.C. 286-287, 1001, 1341, 31 U.S.C. 3729-3730, 3801-3812.); and

(15) No service costs or devices sought for reimbursement have been waived, paid, or promised to be paid by another entity, including any Federal program.

(f) In order to receive Emergency Broadband Benefit Program reimbursement, a participating provider must keep accurate records of the revenues it forgoes in providing Emergency Broadband Benefit-supported services. Such records shall be kept in the form directed by the Administrator and provided to the Administrator at intervals as directed by the Administrator or as provided in this subpart.

(g) In order to receive reimbursement, participating providers shall submit certified reimbursement claims through Lifeline Claims System by the 15th of each month, or the following business day in the event the 15th is a holiday or falls on a weekend. If the participating provider fails to submit a certified reimbursement claim by the deadline for that month, the reimbursement claim will not be processed.
