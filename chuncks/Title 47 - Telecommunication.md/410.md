####### § 1.274 Certification of the record to the Commission for decision when the Commission is not the presiding officer; presiding officer unavailability.

(a) When the Commission is not the presiding officer, and where the Commission finds upon the record that due and timely execution of its functions imperatively and unavoidably so requires, the Commission may direct that the record in a pending proceeding be certified to it for decision.

(b) When a presiding officer becomes unavailable to the Commission after the taking of evidence has been concluded, the Commission shall direct that the record be certified to it for decision. In that event, the Commission shall designate a new presiding officer in accordance with § 1.241 for the limited purpose of certifying the record to the Commission.

(c) In all other circumstances when the Commission is not the presiding officer, the presiding officer shall prepare and file an initial or recommended decision, which will be released in accordance with § 1.267.

(d) When a presiding officer becomes unavailable to the Commission after the taking of evidence has commenced but before it has been concluded, the Commission shall designate another presiding officer in accordance with § 1.241 to continue the hearing proceeding. Oral testimony already introduced shall not be reheard unless observation of the demeanor of the witness is essential to the resolution of the case.
