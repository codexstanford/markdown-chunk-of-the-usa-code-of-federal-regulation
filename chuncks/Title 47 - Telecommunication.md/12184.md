The table specifies a value for the ACP as a function of the displacement from the channel center frequency and a measurement bandwidth of 18 kHz.

(b)(1) Maximum adjacent power levels for frequencies in the 450-470 MHz band:

(2) In any case, no requirement in excess of -36 dBm shall apply.

(c)(1) Maximum adjacent power levels for frequencies in the 809-824/854-869 MHz band:

(2) In any case, no requirement in excess of -36 dBm shall apply.

(d) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 75 kHz, the attenuation of any emission must be at least 43 + 10 log (P) dB.
