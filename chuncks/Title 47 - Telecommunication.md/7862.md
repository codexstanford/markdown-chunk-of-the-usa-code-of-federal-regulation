###### § 64.1330 State review of payphone entry and exit regulations and public interest payphones.

(a) Each state must review and remove any of its regulations applicable to payphones and payphone service providers that impose market entry or exit requirements.

(b) Each state must ensure that access to dialtone, emergency calls, and telecommunications relay service calls for the hearing disabled is available from all payphones at no charge to the caller.

(c) Each state must review its rules and policies to determine whether it has provided for public interest payphones consistent with applicable Commission guidelines, evaluate whether it needs to take measures to ensure that such payphones will continue to exist in light of the Commission's implementation of Section 276 of the Communications Act, and administer and fund such programs so that such payphones are supported fairly and equitably.
