(b) The terms and conditions of the financing are acceptable to SBA;

(c) The source is not the Borrower or an Associate of the Borrower; and

(d) The source has the experience and qualifications to monitor properly all Project construction and progress payments. (If the source lacks such experience or qualifications, SBA may require the interim loan to be managed by a third party such as a bank or professional construction manager.)
