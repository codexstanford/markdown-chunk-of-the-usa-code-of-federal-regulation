##### Special Rules for Leverage Issued by an Early Stage SBIC
###### § 107.1181 Interest reserve requirements for Early Stage SBICs.
####### Reserve requirement.

(a)If you are an Early Stage SBIC with outstanding Leverage, for each Debenture which requires periodic interest payments to SBA during the first five years of its term, you must maintain a reserve sufficient to pay the interest and Charges on such Debenture for the first 21 Payment Dates following the date of issuance. This reserve may consist of any combination of the following:

(1) Binding unfunded commitments from your Institutional Investors that cannot be called for any purpose other than the payment of interest and Charges to SBA, or the payment of any amounts due to SBA; and

(2) Cash maintained in a separate bank account or separate investment account permitted under § 107.530 of this part and separately identified in your financial statements as "restricted cash" available only for the purpose of paying interest and Charges to SBA, or for the payment of any amounts due to SBA.

(b) The required reserve associated with an individual Debenture shall be reduced on each Payment Date upon payment of the required interest and Charges. If you prepay a Debenture prior to the 21st Payment Date following its date of issuance, the reserve requirement associated with that Debenture shall be correspondingly eliminated.

(c) Your limited partnership agreement must incorporate the reserve requirement in paragraph (a) of this section.
