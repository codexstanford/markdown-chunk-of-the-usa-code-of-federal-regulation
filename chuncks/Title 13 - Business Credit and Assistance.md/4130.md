##### § 134.1013 Request for reconsideration.

The decision on a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest may not be appealed. However:

(a) The Judge may reconsider a VOSB or SDVOSB status protest decision. Any party that has appeared in the proceeding, or the SBA, may request reconsideration by filing with OHA and serving a petition for reconsideration on all the parties to the VOSB or SDVOSB status protest within twenty (20) calendar days after service of the written decision. The request for reconsideration must clearly show an error of fact or law material to the decision. The Judge may also reconsider a decision on his or her own initiative.

(b) If the Judge reverses his or her initial decision on reconsideration, the contracting officer must follow § 134.1007(j) in applying the new decision's results.
