##### Participation Criteria
###### § 120.410 Requirements for all participating Lenders.

A Lender must:

(a) Have a continuing ability to evaluate, process, close, disburse, service, liquidate and litigate small business loans including, but not limited to:

(1) Holding sufficient permanent capital to support SBA lending activities (for SBA Lenders with a Federal Financial Institution Regulator, meeting capital requirements for an adequately capitalized financial institution is considered sufficient permanent capital to support SBA lending activities; and for SBLCs and NFRLs, meeting their respective minimum capital requirement); and

(2) Maintaining satisfactory SBA performance, as determined by SBA in its discretion. The 7(a) Lender's Risk Rating, among other factors, will be considered in determining satisfactory SBA performance. Other factors may include, but are not limited to, review/examination assessments, historical performance measures (like default rate, purchase rate and loss rate), loan volume to the extent that it impacts performance measures, and other performance related measurements and information (such as contribution toward SBA mission);

(b) Be open to the public for the making of such loans (not be a financing subsidiary, engaged primarily in financing the operations of an affiliate);

(c) Have continuing good character and reputation, and otherwise meet and maintain the ethical requirements of § 120.140

(d) Be supervised and examined by either:

(1) A Federal Financial Institution Regulator,

(2) A state banking regulator satisfactory to SBA, or

(3) SBA;

(e) Be in good standing with SBA, as defined in § 120.420(f) (and determined by SBA in its discretion), and, as applicable, with its state regulator and be considered Satisfactory by its Federal Financial Institution Regulator (as determined by SBA and based on, for example, information in published orders/agreements and call reports); and

(f) Operate in a safe and sound condition using commercially reasonable lending policies, procedures, and standards employed by prudent Lenders.
