##### § 500.210 Assignment or transfer of loans.

(a) Neither the Loan Documents nor the Guarantee of the Board, or any interest therein, may be modified, assigned, conveyed, sold or otherwise transferred by the Lender, in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of the Board.

(b) Under no circumstances will the Board permit an assignment or transfer of less than 100 percent of a Lender's interest in the Loan Documents and Guarantee, nor will it permit an assignment or transfer to be made to a party which the Board determines not to be an Eligible Lender pursuant to § 500.201.

(c) The proscription under paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to:

(1) Transfers which occur by operation of law, unless a primary purpose of the transaction leading to such a transfer was to assign, convey or sell the loan note or Guarantee without the necessity of securing the Board's prior written approval; or

(2) An action or agreement by the Lender which has the effect of distributing the risks of the credit among other Lenders if:

(i) Neither the loan note nor the Guarantee is assigned, conveyed, sold, or transferred in whole or in part;

(ii) Both the unguaranteed and guaranteed portions of the loan are treated in the same manner;

(iii) The Lender remains solely responsible for the administration of the loan; and

(iv) The Board's ability to assert any and all defenses available to it under the Guarantee and the law is not adversely affected; or

(3) Transfer by a non-Agent Lender of the non-guaranteed portion of the loan after payment under the Guarantee has been made.
