##### § 123.100 Am I eligible to apply for a home disaster loan?

(a) You are eligible to apply for a home disaster loan if you:

(1) Own and occupy your primary residence and have suffered a physical loss to your primary residence, personal property, or both; or

(2) Do not own your primary residence, but have suffered a physical loss to your personal property. Family members sharing a residence are eligible if they are not dependents of the owners of the residence.

(b) Losses may be claimed only by the owners of the property at the time of the disaster, and all such losses will be verified by SBA. SBA will consider beneficial ownership as well as legal title (for real or personal property) in determining who suffered the loss.
