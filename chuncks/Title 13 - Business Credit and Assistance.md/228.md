#### Subpart B - Cosponsored Activities
##### § 106.202 What are the minimum requirements applicable to Cosponsored Activities?

While SBA may subject a Cosponsored Activity to additional requirements through internal policy, procedure and the Cosponsorship Agreement, the following requirements apply to all Cosponsored Activities:

(a) Cosponsored Activities must be set forth in a written Cosponsorship Agreement signed by the Administrator (or designee) and each Cosponsor;

(b) Appropriate recognition must be given to SBA and each Cosponsor but shall not constitute or imply an endorsement by SBA of any Cosponsor or any Cosponsor's products or services;

(c) Any printed or electronically generated material used to publicize or conduct the Cosponsored Activity, including any material which has been developed, prepared or acquired by a Cosponsor, must be approved in advance by the Responsible Program Official and must include a prominent disclaimer stating that the Cosponsored Activity does not constitute or imply an endorsement by SBA of any Cosponsor or the Cosponsor's products or services;

(d) No Cosponsor shall make a profit on any Cosponsored Activity. SBA grantees who earn program income on Cosponsored Activities must use that program income for the Cosponsored Activity;

(e) Participant Fee(s) charged for a Cosponsored Activity may not exceed the minimal amount needed to cover the anticipated direct costs of the Cosponsored Activity and must be liquidated prior to other sources of funding for the Cosponsored Activity. If SBA charges a Participant Fee, the collection of the Participant Fees is subject to internal SBA policies and procedures as well as applicable U.S. Treasury rules and guidelines;

(f) SBA may not provide a Cosponsor with lists of names and addresses of small business concerns compiled by SBA which are otherwise protected by law or policy from disclosure; and

(g) Written approval must be obtained as outlined in § 106.204.
