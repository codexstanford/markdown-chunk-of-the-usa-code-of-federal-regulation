##### § 123.502 Under what circumstances is your business ineligible to be considered for a Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan?

Your business is ineligible for a Military Reservist EIDL if it, together with its affiliates, is subject to any of the following conditions:

(a) Any of your business' principal owners has been convicted, during the past year, of a felony during and in connection with a riot or civil disorder;

(b) You have assumed the risk associated with employing the military reservist, as determined by SBA (for example, hiring the "essential employee" after the employee has received call-up orders or been notified that they are imminent);

(c) Any of your business' principal owners is presently incarcerated, or on probation or parole following conviction of a serious criminal offense;

(d) Your business is an agricultural enterprise. Agricultural enterprise means a business primarily engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching and raising of livestock, aquaculture and all other farming and agriculture-related industries. (See 13 CFR 121.107, "How does SBA determine a concern's primary industry?") Sometimes a business is engaged in both agricultural and non-agricultural business activities. If the primary business activity of the business is not an agricultural enterprise, it may apply for a Military Reservist EIDL, but loan proceeds may not be used, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the agricultural enterprises;

(e) Your business is engaged in any illegal activity;

(f) Your business is a government owned entity (except for a business owned or controlled by a Native American tribe);

(g) Your business presents live performances of a prurient sexual nature or derives directly or indirectly more than an insignificant gross revenue through the sale of products or services, or through the presentation of any depictions or displays, of a prurient sexual nature;

(h) Your business is engaged in lending, multi-level sales distribution, speculation, or investment (except for real estate investment with property held for commercial rental);

(i) Your business is a non-profit or charitable concern;

(j) Your business is a consumer or marketing cooperative;

(k) Your business is not a small business concern;

(l) Your business derives more than one-third of its gross annual revenue from legal gambling activities;

(m) Your business is a loan packager which earns more than one-third of its gross annual revenue from packaging SBA loans;

(n) Your business' principal activity is teaching, instructing, counseling, or indoctrinating religion or religious beliefs, whether in a religious or secular setting; or

(o) Your business' principal activity is political or lobbying activities.
