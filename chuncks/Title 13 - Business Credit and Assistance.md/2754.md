(ii) If the IDAP Borrower is located in a Contiguous County, for working capital necessary to carry the IDAP Borrower until resumption of normal operations and for expenditures necessary to alleviate the specific economic injury, but not to exceed that which the IDAP Borrower could have provided had the injury not occurred.

(2) For an SBA Administrative Disaster Declaration, if the IDAP Borrower is located in either a Primary County or a Contiguous County, to restore or replace the IDAP Borrower's real or business personal property to its condition before the Declared Disaster occurred and/or for working capital necessary to carry the IDAP Borrower until resumption of normal operations and for expenditures necessary to alleviate the specific economic injury, but not to exceed that which the IDAP Borrower could have provided had the injury not occurred.

(8) Repair or replace property not located within the Declared Disaster Area at the time of the Declared Disaster;

(9) Repay stockholder/Associate loans, except where the funds were injected on an interim basis as a result of the Declared Disaster and non-repayment would cause undue hardship to the stockholder/Associate;
