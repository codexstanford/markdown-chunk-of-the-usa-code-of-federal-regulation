##### § 123.102 What circumstances would justify my relocating?

SBA may approve a loan if you intend to relocate outside the business area in which the disaster has occurred if your relocation is caused by such special or unusual circumstances as:

(a) Demonstrable risk that the business area will suffer future disasters;

(b) A change in employment status (such as loss of job, transfer, lack of adequate job opportunities within the business area or scheduled retirement within 18 months after the disaster occurs);

(c) Medical reasons; or

(d) Special family considerations which necessitate a move outside of the business area.
