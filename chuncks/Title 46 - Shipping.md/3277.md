##### Subpart 62.25 - General Requirements for All Automated Vital Systems
###### § 62.25-1 General.

(a) Vital systems that are automatically or remotely controlled must be provided with-

(1) An effective primary control system;

(2) A manual alternate control system;

(3) A safety control system, if required by § 62.25-15;

(4) Instrumentation to monitor system parameters necessary for the safe and effective operation of the system; and

(5) An alarm system if instrumentation is not continuously monitored or is inappropriate for detection of a failure or unsafe condition.

(b) Automation systems or subsystems that control or monitor more than one safety control, interlock, or operating sequence must perform all assigned tasks continuously, i.e., the detection of unsafe conditions must not prevent control or monitoring of other conditions.

(c) Each console for a vital control or alarm system and any similar enclosure that relies upon forced cooling for proper operation of the system must have a backup means of providing cooling. It must also have an alarm activated by the failure of the temperature-control system.
