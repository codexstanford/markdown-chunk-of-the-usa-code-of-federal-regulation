(viii) All devices required for measuring appropriate parameters, such as pressure, temperature, flow rate, water quality, power, and chemical residuals.

(7) A description of all relevant standard operating procedures including, but not limited to-

(i) BWMS start-up and shutdown procedures and times;

(ii) Emergency shutdown and system by-pass procedures;

(iii) Requirements to achieve treatment objectives (e. g., time following initial treatment, critical dosages, residual concentrations, etc);

(iv) Operating, safety, and emergency procedures;

(v) BWMS limitations, precautions, and set points;

(vi) Detailed instructions on operation, calibration and zeroing of each monitoring device used with the BWMS; and

(vii) Personnel requirements for the BWMS, including number and types of personnel needed, labor burden, and operator training or specialty certification requirements.

(8) A description of the preventive and corrective maintenance requirements of the BWMS, including-

(i) Inspection and adjustment procedures;

(ii) Troubleshooting procedures;

(iii) An illustrated list of parts and spare parts;

(iv) A list of recommended spare parts to have during installation and operation of the BWMS;

(v) Use of tools and test equipment in accordance with the maintenance procedures; and

(vi) Point(s) of contact for technical assistance.

(9) A description of the health and safety risks to the personnel associated with the installation, operation, and maintenance of the BWMS including, but not limited to-
