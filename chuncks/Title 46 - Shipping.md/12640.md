The presiding officer will, where practicable, issue prehearing rulings, acting on petitions for leave to intervene, delineating the issues, summarizing the rulings made at the conference, specifying a schedule for the exchange of exhibits and written testimony, the date, time and place of hearing and specifying a time for the filing of exceptions to the rulings. The prehearing rulings shall be served upon all parties to the proceeding and any persons who participated in the conference.
