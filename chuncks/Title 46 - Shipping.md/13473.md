###### § 298.24 Financing a Vessel more than a year after delivery.

(a) We may approve Guarantees for a Vessel which has been delivered (or redelivered in the case of reconstruction or reconditioning of a Vessel) more than one year prior to the issuance of the Guarantees only if:

(1) The issuance of the Guarantees would otherwise satisfy the requirements of the Act and the regulations in this part, and

(2) The proceeds of the Obligation financing such existing Vessel are used to finance:

(i) The construction, reconstruction, or reconditioning of a different Vessel within one year of that Vessel's delivery or redelivery, as the case may be, or

(ii) Facilities or equipment pertaining to marine operations. Such facilities or equipment must be of a specialized nature, used principally for servicing vessels and in handling waterborne cargo in the close proximity of the berthing area, excluding over-the-road equipment (other than chassis and containers), permanent or semipermanent structures and real estate, as well as new or less than one year old.

(b) At the Closing of Guarantees covered by this section, you must deposit the proceeds of the Obligation into an Escrow Fund established to pay for the cost unless you demonstrate to our satisfaction that all such costs have been paid.
