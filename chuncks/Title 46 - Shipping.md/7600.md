(a) No fires or open flames are on deck or in compartments near the hose connections when Table 1 requires the cargo's containment system to have a fire protection system.

(b) Any electrical bonding of the tankship to the transfer facility is made before the cargo transfer piping is joined.

(c) Any supplemental inert gas supply necessary to maintain the 3.5 kPa gauge (approx. 0.5 psig) pressure in the tank during offloading (see § 153.500) is connected to the inert gas pressure control system.

(d) The transfer connections have enough slack to allow for vessel movement.

(e) The transfer connections are supported by tackles.

(f) The cargo high level alarms, tank overflow alarms and overflow control systems are functioning correctly when the cargo is loaded.
