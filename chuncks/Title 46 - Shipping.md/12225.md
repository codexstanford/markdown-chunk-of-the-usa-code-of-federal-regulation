(iii) Any modifications to the operations manual or procedures including safety procedures necessitated by the specific diving operation;

(2) The breathing gas supply systems, masks, helmets, thermal protection, when provided, and bell lifting equipment, when a bell is provided or required, are inspected prior to each diving operation;

(3) Each diver is instructed to report any physical problems or physiological effects including aches, pains, current illnesses, or symptoms of decompression sickness prior to each dive;

(4) A depth, bottom time profile, including any breathing mixture changes, is maintained at the dive location for each diver during the dive, except that SCUBA divers shall maintain their own profiles;

(5) A two-way voice communication system is used between-

(i) Each surface-supplied diver and a dive team member at the dive location or bell (when provided); and

(ii) The bell (when provided) and the dive location;

(6) A two-way communication system is available at the dive location to obtain emergency assistance;

(7) After the completion of each dive-

(i) The physical condition of the diver is checked by-
