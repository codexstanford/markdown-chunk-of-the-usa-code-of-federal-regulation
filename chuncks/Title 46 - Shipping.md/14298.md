(1) A number assigned for control and reference purposes;

(ii) The transfer of money, property, or services to a recipient for support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute;

(4) A statement about how unsolicited proposals will be evaluated and accepted:

(i) If the principal program objective is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation, the criteria in §§ 385.50 through 385.52 shall be applied;

(5) Restrictions, if any, as to who may submit proposals;

(6) A contact where additional information may be obtained;
