###### § 28.820 Fire pumps, fire mains, fire hydrants, and fire hoses.

(a) Each vessel must be equipped with a self-priming, power driven fire pump connected to a fixed piping system. This pump must be capable of delivering an effective stream of water from a hose connected to the highest outlet. The minimum capacity of the power fire pump shall be 50 gallons per minute at a pressure of not less than 60 pounds per square inch at the pump outlet.

If a vessel already has on board a portable pump satisfying the bilge system requirements of § 28.255(d), no additional portable pump is required as long as the portable pump is of sufficient size/capacity, and is properly equipped to handle both fire fighting and flood control.

(b) Each vessel must have a sufficient number of fire hydrants to reach any part of the vessel using a single length of hose.

(c) Each fire hydrant must have at least one length of fire hose connected to the outlet at all times, a spanner, and a hose rack or other device for stowing the hose at all times.
