(d) Each circuit breaker and each switch must simultaneously open all ungrounded conductors.

(e) The grounded conductor of a circuit must not be disconnected by a switch or an overcurrent device unless all ungrounded conductors of the circuit are simultaneously disconnected.

(f) Navigation light circuits must be separate, switched circuits having fused disconnect switches or circuit breakers so that only the appropriate navigation lights can be switched on.

(g) A separate circuit with overcurrent protection at the main distribution panel or switchboard must be provided for each radio installation.
