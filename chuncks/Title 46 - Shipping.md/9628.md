###### § 160.174-25 Production testing.

(a) Thermal protective aid production testing is conducted under the procedures in this section and subpart 159.007 of this chapter.

(b) One out of every 100 thermal protective aids produced must be given a complete visual examination. The sample must be selected at random from a production lot of 100 thermal protective aids and examined by or under the supervision of the independent laboratory. The sample fails if the visual examination shows that the aid does not conform to the approved design.

(c) If a defect in the thermal protective aid is detected upon visual examination, 10 additional samples from the same lot must be selected at random and examined for the defect.

(d) If one or more of the 10 samples fails the examination, each thermal protective aid in the lot must be examined for the defect for which the lot was rejected. Only thermal protective aids that are free of defects may be sold as Coast Guard approved.
