###### § 113.50-15 Loudspeakers.

(a) Loudspeakers must be located to eliminate feedback or other interference which would degrade communication.

(b) Loudspeakers must be located to provide intelligible and audible one-way communication throughout the vessel. Weatherdeck loudspeakers must be watertight and suitably protected from the effects of the wind and seas.

(c) There must be a sufficient number of loudspeakers throughout the vessel. The public address system must be installed with regard to acoustically marginal conditions and not require any action from the addressee. With the vessel underway in normal conditions, the minimum sound pressure levels for broadcasting emergency announcements must be-

(1) In interior spaces, 75 dB(A) or, if the background noise level exceeds 75 dB(A), then at least 20 dB(A) above maximum background noise level; and

(2) In exterior spaces, 80 dB(A) or, if the background noise level exceeds 80 dB(A), then at least 15 dB(A) above maximum background noise level.

(d) Loudspeakers must not have external volume controls or local cutout switches.
