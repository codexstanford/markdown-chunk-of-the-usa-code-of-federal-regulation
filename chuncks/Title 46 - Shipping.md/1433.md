###### § 28.825 Excess fire detection and protection equipment.

Instead of meeting the requirements of § 28.155, each vessel to which this subpart applies must meet the following requirements:

(a) Installation of fire detection and protection equipment in excess of that required by the regulations in this subchapter is permitted provided that the excess equipment does not endanger the vessel or individuals on board in any way. The excess equipment must, at a minimum, be listed and labeled by an independent, nationally recognized testing laboratory and be in accordance with an appropriate industry standard for design, installation, testing, and maintenance.

(b) An existing fixed gas fire extinguishing system that is in excess of the required fire protection equipment required by subparts A, B, and C of this part, may remain in place and continue in service as long as all parts of the system are maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the Coast Guard Representative, and subject to the following:

(1) A fixed fire extinguishing system capable of automatic discharge upon heat detection, may only be installed in a normally unoccupied space. For the purpose of this section, the machinery space aboard a fish tender operating in the Aleutian trade is considered occupied.

(2) A fixed fire extinguishing system must:

(i) Be capable of manual actuation from outside the space protected;

(ii) Produce an audible alarm to indicate the discharge of the extinguishing agent for 20 seconds before the extinguishing agent is released into the space;

(iii) The branch line valves of all fire extinguishing systems shall be plainly and permanently marked indicating the spaces serviced;

(iv) The control cabinets or spaces containing valves or manifolds for the various fire extinguishing systems must be distinctly marked in conspicuous red letters at least 2 inches high: "[CARBON DIOXIDE/FOAM/CLEAN AGENT-as appropriate] FIRE SYSTEM."

(v) Instructions for the operation of the system must be located in a conspicuous place at or near all pull boxes, stop valve controls, and in the agent storage space;

(vi) If the space or enclosure containing the supply or controls is to be locked, a key to the space or enclosure shall be in a break-glass-type box conspicuously located adjacent to the opening, and;

(vii) Be equipped with a sign at the alarm stating: "WHEN ALARM SOUNDS-VACATE AT ONCE. CARBON DIOXIDE BEING RELEASED", or list other fire extinguishing agent.

(3) Any modification, alteration, or new installation of a fixed gas fire extinguishing system must meet the additional requirements of subpart D of this part.
