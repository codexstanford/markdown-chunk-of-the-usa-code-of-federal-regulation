(a) All survival craft required for abandonment by the total number of persons on board must be capable of being launched with their full complement of persons and equipment within 10 minutes from the time the abandon-ship signal is given.

(b)(1) Each launching appliance must be a davit approved under 46 CFR part 160, subpart 160.132 for use with the intended craft, with a winch approved under 46 CFR part 160, subpart 160.115 for use with the intended craft.

(2) Each launching appliance for a davit-launched liferaft must include an automatic disengaging apparatus approved under 46 CFR part 160, subpart 160.170 and be either-

(i) A launching appliance described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or

(ii) A launching appliance approved on or before November 10, 2011 under approval series 160.163.

(c) Unless expressly provided otherwise, each survival craft must be provided launching appliances or marine evacuation systems, except-

(1) Those survival craft that can be boarded from a position on deck less than 4.5 meters (14.75 feet) above the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition and that have a mass of not more than 185 kilograms (407 pounds);

(2) Those survival craft that can be boarded from a position on deck less than 4.5 meters (14.75 feet) above the waterline in the lightest seagoing condition and that are stowed for launching directly from the stowed position, under unfavorable conditions of trim of 10 degrees and list of 20 degrees either way;

(3) Those survival craft that are carried in excess of the survival craft for 200 percent of the total number of persons on board the OSV, and that have a mass of not more than 185 kilograms (407 pounds);

(4) Those survival craft carried in excess of the survival craft for 200 percent of the total number of persons on board the OSV, and are stowed for launching directly from the stowed position under unfavorable conditions of trim of 10 degrees and list of 20 degrees either way;

(5) Those survival craft that are provided for use in conjunction with a marine evacuation system, and stowed for launching directly from the stowed position under unfavorable conditions of trim of 10 degrees and list of 20 degrees either way; or

(6) Liferafts installed on liftboats.

(d) Each launching appliance must be arranged so that the fully equipped survival craft the launching appliance serves can be safely launched against unfavorable conditions of trim of up to 10 degrees either way and of list of up to 20 degrees either way,-

(1) When the survival craft is loaded with its full complement of persons; and

(2) When not more than the required operating crew is on board.

(e) A launching appliance must not depend on any means other than gravity or stored mechanical power, independent of the OSV's power supplies, to launch the survival craft the launching appliance serves, in the fully loaded and equipped condition, and also in the light condition.

(f) Each launching appliance's structural attachment to the OSV must be designed to be at least 4.5 times-

(1) The load imparted on the attachment by the launching appliance and its fully loaded survival craft under the most adverse combination of list and trim as required under paragraph (b) of this section; and

(2) The ultimate strength of the construction material.

(g) Each launching appliance must be arranged so that-

(1) All parts requiring regular maintenance by the OSV's crew are readily accessible and easily maintained;

(2) The launching appliance remains effective under conditions of icing;

(3) The same type of release mechanism is used for each similar survival craft carried on board the OSV;

(4) The preparation and handling of each survival craft at any one launching station does not interfere with the prompt preparation and handling of any other survival craft at any other station;

(5) The persons on board the OSV can safely and rapidly board the survival craft;

(6) Each davit-launched liferaft can be boarded by its full complement of persons within 3 minutes from the time the instruction to board is given: and

(7) During preparation and launching, the survival craft, its launching appliance, and the area of water into which it is to be launched is illuminated by lighting supplied from the emergency source of electrical power.

(h) Each launching mechanism must be arranged so it may be actuated by one person, both from a position on the OSV's deck, and from a position within the survival craft. Each launching and recovery arrangement must allow the operator on the deck to observe the survival craft at all times during launching.

(i) Means must be provided outside the machinery space to prevent any discharge of water onto survival craft during abandonment.
