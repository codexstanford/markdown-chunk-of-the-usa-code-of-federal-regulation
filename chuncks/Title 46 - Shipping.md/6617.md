(a) A towing vessel may not be operated without having onboard a valid COI issued by the Coast Guard as required by § 136.202.

(b) Each towing vessel certificated under the provisions of this subchapter must be in full compliance with the terms of the COI.

(d) A towing vessel on a foreign voyage between a port in the United States and a port in a foreign country whose COI expires during the voyage may lawfully complete the voyage without a valid COI, provided the voyage is completed within 30 days of expiration, and provided that the COI did not expire within 15 days of sailing on the foreign voyage from a U.S. port.
