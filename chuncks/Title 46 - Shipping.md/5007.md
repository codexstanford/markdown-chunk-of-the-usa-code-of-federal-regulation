(a) Each helicopter landing deck on which fueling operations are conducted must have a fire protection system that discharges protein foam or aqueous film forming foam.

(b) a system that only discharges foam must-

(1) Have enough foam agent to discharge foam continuously for at least 5 minutes at maximum discharge rate;

(2) Have at least the amount of foam agent needed to cover an area equivalent to the swept rotor area of the largest helicopter for which the deck is designed with foam at-

(i) If protein foam is used, 6.52 liters per minute for each square meter (.16 gallons per minute for each square foot) of area covered for five minutes;

(ii) If aqueous film forming foam is used, 4.07 liters per minute for each square meter (.1 gallons per minute for each square foot) of area covered for five minutes; and

(3) Be capable of discharging from each hose at 7 kilograms per square centimeter (100 pounds per square inch) pressure-

(i) A single foam stream at a rate of at least 340 liters (90 gallons) per minute; and

(ii) A foam spray at a rate of at least 190 liters (50 gallons) per minute.

(c) Each system must have operating controls at each of its hose locations, be protected from icing and freezing, and be capable of operation within 10 seconds after activation of its controls.

(d) Each system must have at least one hose at each of the two access routes required by § 108.235(f) of this part. Each hose must be reel mounted and long enough to cover any point on the helicopter deck. Each hose that discharges foam must have a nozzle that has foam stream, foam spray, and off positions.
