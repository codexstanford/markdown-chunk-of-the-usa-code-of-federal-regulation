Motions made at the hearing to correct the record will be acted upon by the presiding officer.

Such motions may be in the form of a letter and shall certify the date when the transcript was received. If no objections are received within ten (10) days after date of service, the transcript will, upon approval of the presiding officer, be changed to reflect such corrections. If objections are received, the motion will be acted upon with due consideration of the stenographic record of the hearing.
