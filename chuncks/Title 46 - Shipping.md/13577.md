(b) Assureds under interim binders are required to notify MARAD's underwriting agent annually, by June 30th, of any change in the information provided in their original binder applications including, but not limited to, change of address, vessel name or vessel characteristics.

(c) New applications for interim binders on American vessels, with necessary attachments (as specified in § 308.3), as well as checks for the binder fees prescribed made payable to "Maritime Administration, Department of Transportation," shall be filed with the MARAD's underwriting agent. All interim binders on American vessels shall become effective as of the date of determination of eligibility by MARAD.
