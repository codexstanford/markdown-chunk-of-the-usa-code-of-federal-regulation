(a) In place of compliance with other applicable provisions of this title, the owner or operator of a vessel subject to plan review and inspection under this subchapter for initial issuance or renewal of a COI may submit the vessel for classification, plan review and inspection by a recognized classification society authorized by the Coast Guard to determine compliance with applicable international treaties and agreements, the classification society's class rules, and the U.S. supplement prepared by the classification society and accepted by the Coast Guard.

(b) A vessel owner or operator wishing to have a vessel inspected under paragraph (a) of this section shall submit an Application for Inspection of U.S. Vessel (CG-3752) to the cognizant OCMI, and indicate on the form that the inspection will be conducted by an authorized classification society under the ACP.
