###### § 164.009-17 Density measurement.

(a) The measurements described in this section are made to determine the density of a sample.

(b) If the sample is a solid material, a specimen that has a length of 305 mm, a width of 305 mm, and thickness equal to that of the sample is prepared. The length and width are measured to the nearest 0.80 mm and the thickness to the nearest 0.25 mm. Allowance is made for any irregularity in the surfaces of the specimen. The average of at least four measurements of each dimension is determined.

(c) If the sample is fibrous insulation, a specimen is prepared from sheets of the sample submitted. The sample is a cube and each dimension is 305 mm +/-1.60 mm. The average of at least four measurements of each dimension is determined.

(d) The weight of a specimen is determined with a sensitive balance scale accurate to at least 0.5 percent of the weight of the specimen.

(e) The dimension and weight measurements of a specimen are made after it has been conditioned for at least one week, and for any additional time needed for the specimen to reach a constant weight, in an atmosphere that is 22.8 &#xB0;C. +/-2 &#xB0;C. and 50 percent +/-5 percent relative humidity.
