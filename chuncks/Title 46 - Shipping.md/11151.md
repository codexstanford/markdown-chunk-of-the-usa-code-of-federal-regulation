###### § 172.225 Calculations.

(a) Each vessel must be shown by design calculations to meet the survival conditions in § 172.245 in each condition of loading and operation, assuming the damage specified in § 172.230.

(b) When doing the calculations required by paragraph (a) of this section, the virtual increase in the vertical center of gravity due to a liquid in a space must be determined by calculating either-

(1) The free surface effect of the liquid with the vessel assumed heeled five degrees from the vertical; or

(2) The shift of the center of gravity of the liquid by the moment of transference method.

(c) In calculating the free surface effect of consumable liquids, it must be assumed that, for each type of liquid, at least one transverse pair of wing tanks or a single centerline tank has a free surface. The tank or combination of tanks selected must be those having the greatest free surface effect.

(d) When doing the calculations required by paragraph (a) of this section, the buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage must not be considered. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage may be considered if they are separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and no progressive flooding of these intact spaces takes place.
