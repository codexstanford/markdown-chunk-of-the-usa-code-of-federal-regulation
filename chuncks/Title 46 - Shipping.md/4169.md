(b) The detectors must be located on the overhead in the space protected at a minimum distance of 18 in (0.5 m) away from bulkheads, except in corridors, lockers, and stairways.

(g) A sufficient number of manual alarm stations must be employed to enable a person escaping from any space to find a manual alarm station on his or her normal escape route.

(h) Cables that form part of a fire detection and alarm system must be arranged to avoid galleys and machinery and other high fire risk spaces except where it is necessary to provide for fire detection and alarms in such spaces or to connect to an appropriate power supply.
