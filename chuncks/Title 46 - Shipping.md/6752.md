###### § 140.620 Navigational safety equipment.

(a) This section applies to a towing vessel not subject to the requirements of 33 CFR 164.82.

(b) The owner, managing operator, or master of each towing vessel must maintain the required navigational-safety equipment in a fully-functioning, operational condition.

(c) Navigational safety equipment such as radar, gyrocompass, echo depth-sounding or other sounding device, automatic dependent surveillance equipment, or navigational lighting that fails during a voyage must be repaired at the earliest practicable time. The owner, managing operator, or master must consider the state of the equipment (along with such factors as weather, visibility, traffic, and the dictates of good seamanship) when deciding whether it is safe for the vessel to proceed.

(d) The failure and subsequent repair or replacement of navigational safety equipment must be recorded. The record must be made in the TVR, official logbook, or in accordance with the TSMS applicable to the vessel.
