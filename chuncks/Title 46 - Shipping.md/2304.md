(a) The load line marks on the vessel's sides must be in accordance with § 42.13-25(a) of this subchapter, except seasonal markings such as "Winter North Atlantic" which are not applicable to the voyage are omitted.

(b) In the case of vessels which engage in special services on coastwise voyages and voyages on the Great Lakes, the marks on the vessel's sides are to be in accordance with Figure 44.05-10(b), except that the lines marked "SW" and "MS" shall be used only where applicable.

(c) The load lines aft of the combined disk and diamond will be applicable for voyages on the Great Lakes and those on the forward side will be applicable to limited coastwise voyages. The summer line on the ocean will correspond to the summer line on the Lakes and the winter line on the ocean will correspond to the intermediate line on the Lakes.

(d) In the case of vessels which operate both on special service coastwise voyages and on unlimited coastwise voyages, the marks on the ship's sides are to be in accordance with figure 44.05-10 (d). The load lines aft of the disk will be applicable to voyages in special service coastwise or inter-island voyages and those on the forward side will be applicable to unlimited coastwise voyages. (A vessel marked for both special service and unlimited coastwise voyages and furnished with a load line certificate on the international form shall, when entering the foreign trade, arrange that the load line markings are in accord with the vessel's international load line certificate by the elimination of the marks aft of the disk.)
