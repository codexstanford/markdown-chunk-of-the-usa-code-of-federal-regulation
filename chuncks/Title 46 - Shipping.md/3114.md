###### § 58.20-25 Tests.

(a) All pressure vessels, compressors, piping, and direct expansion cooling coils shall be leak tested after installation to their design pressures, hydrostatically or pneumatically.

(b) No pneumatic tests in refrigeration systems aboard ships shall be made at pressures exceeding the design pressure of the part of the system being tested. Pneumatic tests may be made with the refrigerant in the system or if the refrigerant has been removed, oil-pumped dry nitrogen or bone dry carbon dioxide with a detectable amount of the refrigerant added, should be used as a testing medium. (Carbon dioxide should not be used to leak test an ammonia system.) In no case should air, oxygen, any flammable gas or any flammable mixture of gases be used for testing.
