###### § 385.38 Joint funding.

(a) Pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act, MarAd is authorized to participate in joint funded projects with other Federal agencies in any funding relationship which will serve the best interest of all of the participating agencies' program. Such joint funding project may include more than one type of assistance relationship, e.g., some components of project may be funded by grants and other components of the project may be funded by cooperative agreements.

(b) It is MarAd's positive policy, further, to encourage cost-sharing on the part of applicants for financial assistance. The willingness of applicants to cost-share is a primary factor in making, or not making, an assistance award.
