(b) Each emergency outfit must have on board the following equipment:

(1) One pressure-demand, open-circuit, self-contained breathing apparatus, approved by the Mine Safety and Health Administration and by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and having at a minimum a 30-minute air supply, a full facepiece, and a spare charge.

(2) One lifeline with a belt or a suitable harness.

(3) One Type II or Type III flashlight constructed and marked in accordance with ASTM F1014-02 (incorporated by reference, see § 125.180).

(4) One fire axe.

(5) One pair of boots and gloves of rubber or other electrically nonconducting material.

(6) One rigid helmet that provides effective protection against impact.

(7) One set of protective clothing of material that will protect the skin from the heat of fire and burns from scalding steam. The outer surface must be water resistant.

(c) Lifelines must be of steel or bronze wire rope. Steel wire rope must be either inherently corrosion resistant or made so by galvanizing or tinning. Each end must be fitted with a hook with keeper having a throat opening that can be readily slipped over a-inch bolt. The total length of the lifeline must be dependent upon the size and arrangement of the vessel, and more than one line may be hooked together to achieve the necessary length. No individual lifeline may be less than 50 feet in length. The assembled lifeline must have a minimum breaking strength of 1,500 pounds.
