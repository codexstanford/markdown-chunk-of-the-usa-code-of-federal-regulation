(iv) The discussion of, or agreement on, any service contract matter.

(b) The determination of an agreement's reporting obligation under § 535.702(a)(2) in the first instance shall be based on the market share data reported on the agreement's Information Form pursuant to § 535.503. Thereafter, at the beginning of each calendar year, the Bureau of Trade Analysis will notify the agreement parties of any changes in its reporting requirements based on market share data reported on the agreement's quarterly Monitoring Report for the previous second quarter (April-June).

(d) In addition to or instead of the Monitoring Report in § 535.703, the Commission may prescribe, as necessary, alternative periodic reporting requirements for parties to any agreement identified in § 535.201.
