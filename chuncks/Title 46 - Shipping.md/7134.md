#### PART 150 - COMPATIBILITY OF CARGOES
##### § 150.130 Loading a cargo on vessels carrying cargoes with which it is incompatible.

Except as described in § 150.160, the person in charge of a vessel shall ensure that the containment system for a cargo that is a hazardous material meets the following requirements:

(a) The containment system must separate the hazardous material or its residue from any cargo in table 1 with which it is incompatible by two barriers such as formed by a:

(1) Cofferdam;

(2) Empty tank;

(3) Void space;

(4) Cargo handling space;

(5) Tank containing a compatible cargo; or

(6) Piping tunnel.

(b) In this subpart, isolation across a cruciform joint is equivalent to isolation by two barriers.

(c) The containment system for the hazardous material must not have a piping or venting system that connects to a containment system carrying a cargo with which the hazardous material is incompatible. Any such piping or venting system must have been separated from the containment system carrying the incompatible cargo by:

(1) Removing a valve or spool piece and blanking off the exposed pipe ends, or

(2) Installing two spectacle flanges in series with a means of detecting leakage into the pipe between the spectacle flanges.
