####### § 308.516 Failure to comply with Clause 21.

(a) If the assured willfully fails to maintain a collateral deposit fund or a surety bond in an amount sufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 21, the policy becomes void from the date the fund or bond was first insufficient, but, if the assured's failure was inadvertent, the policy may be reinstated when the assured complies with Clause 21, and shows to the satisfaction of the Maritime Administrator that his failure was inadvertent and not willful. If the failure was in fact inadvertent, the assured shall file a declaration on Form MA-314, prescribed in § 308.536, executed in duplicate, with the Underwriting Agent within seven (7) days from the time knowledge comes to the assured of the insufficiency of the collateral deposit fund or surety bond unless the time for filing such declaration is extended by permission of the Maritime Administrator. If the space provided in the declaration, Form MA-314, for an explanation of the circumstances whereby the assured first had knowledge that the collateral was not sufficient, the assured shall attach to the declaration a detailed statement and include the same by reference in the declaration.

(b) If any policy becomes void by reason of the failure of the assured to deposit additional collateral or increase the amount of its surety bond under the provisions of Clause 21, the Maritime Administrator reserves the right to refuse to issue another policy to such assured for a period of ninety (90) days.
