##### Criteria for Award
###### § 385.51 Criteria: Projects.

The criteria to be used by MarAd in evaluating all projects prior to award of a grant or cooperative agreement are as follows:

(a) In terms of the accomplishment of a public purpose-

(1) The potential contribution which the proposed work is expected to make to the MarAd assistance mission;

(2) The economic, environmental, and societal significance which a successful demonstration or project may have for the nation, and in particular the national merchant marine program;

(3) The relationship of the proposal to:

(i) The public need for the potential results of the research, development, or demonstration effort, and whether it is unlikely that similar results would be achieved in a timely manner in the absence of Federal assistance;

(ii) Whether the potential opportunities for non-Federal interests to recapture the investment in the undertaking through the normal commercial utilization of proprietary knowledge appear inadequate to encourage timely results;

(iii) The extent of the problems treated and whether the objectives sought by the undertaking are national, widespread, or regional in their significance;

(iv) The extent of opportunities to induce non-Federal support of the undertaking;

(v) The degree of risk of loss of the investment inherent in the research, and the availability of risk capital to the non-Federal entities which might otherwise engage in the field of the research so as to further timely development of the technology; and,

(vi) The availability of appropriations to MarAd.

(b) In terms of the particular objectives of the project, whether the project has:

(1) High technical merit which promises or represents an innovative idea, method, or approach;

(2) Program value not previously recognized or pursued by MarAd; and,

(3) A reasonable degree of probability of achieving the stated objectives.
