###### § 117.130 Stowage of survival craft.

(a) Each survival craft must be:

(1) Secured to the vessel by a painter with a float-free link permanently attached to the vessel except that a float-free link is not required if the vessel operates only on waters not as deep as the length of the painter;

(2) Stowed so that when the vessel sinks the survival craft floats free and, if inflatable, inflates automatically;

(3) Stowed in a position that is readily accessible to crew members for launching, or else provided with a remotely operated device that releases the survival craft into launching position or into the water;

(4) Stowed in a way that permits manual release from its securing arrangements;

(5) Ready for immediate use so that crew members can carry out preparations for embarkation and launching in less than 5 minutes;

(6) Provided with means to prevent shifting;

(7) Stowed in a way that neither the survival craft nor its stowage arrangements will interfere with the embarkation and operation of any other survival craft at any other launching station;

(8) Stowed in a way that any protective covers will not interfere with launching and embarkation;

(9) Fully equipped as required under this part; and

(10) Stowed, as far as practicable, in a position sheltered from breaking seas and protected from damage by fire.

(b) A hydrostatic release unit when used in a float-free arrangement must be approved under approval series 160.062 or 160.162 or a standard specified by the Commandant.

(c) A mechanical, manually operated device to assist in launching a survival craft must be provided if:

(1) The survival craft weighs more than 90.7 kilograms (200 pounds); and

(2) The survival craft requires lifting more than 300 vertical millimeters (one vertical foot) to be launched.
