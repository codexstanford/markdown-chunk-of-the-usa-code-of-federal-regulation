###### § 308.1 Eligibility for vessel insurance.

Any vessel within one of the following categories shall be eligible for insurance, but shall remain eligible only while meeting the qualifications criteria in one of said categories. An eligible vessel is not insured unless and until an application is submitted as required in subpart B, C, or D of this part 308 and the Maritime Administrator, Department of Transportation, (Maritime Administrator) Maritime Administration (MARAD), approves said application.

(a) A vessel registered, enrolled, or licensed under the laws of the United States of America (United States); any undocumented vessel owned or chartered by or made available to the United States or any department or agency thereof; any tug or barge or other watercraft (documented under the laws of the United States, or undocumented) owned by a citizen of the United States and used in essential water transportation; and United States citizen-owned watercraft used in the fishing trade or industry, except when used exclusively in or for sport fishing.

(b) Any vessel, other than a vessel described in paragraph (a) of this section determined by the Maritime Administrator to be engaged in the national defense or the national economy of the United States and subject to an unqualified Contract of Commitment with the United States in a form required by the Maritime Administrator, and which is:

(1) Owned by a United States corporation, or a foreign corporation in which a majority of the stock is owned and controlled by a citizen or citizens of the United States, whether direct or through intervening corporations, foreign or domestic. Where such intervening corporations are foreign, the ultimate majority ownership and control of the stock of such corporations must be vested in a citizen or citizens of the United States as defined 46 U.S.C. 50501(a);

(2) Owned by a foreign corporation which is not directly or beneficially owned by a citizen or citizens of the United States, but which vessel is under a long-term charter or other long-term contract covering the use of the vessel on terms deemed by the Maritime Administrator to subject the vessel to United States control in the event of an emergency. The charterer of such vessel must be either a citizen or citizens of the United States or a foreign corporation in which a majority of the stock is owned and controlled by a citizen or citizens of the United States, whether direct or indirect through intervening corporations, foreign or domestic. Where such intervening corporations are foreign, ultimate majority ownership and control of the stock of such corporations must be vested in a citizen or citizens of the United States, as defined in 46 U.S.C. 50501(a).

(c) Any other vessel, at the sole discretion of the Maritime Administrator, but only while engaged in a service which has been determined by the Maritime Administrator to be in the interest of the national defense or the national economy of the United States. Vessels in this category are not eligible for war risk insurance interim binders.
