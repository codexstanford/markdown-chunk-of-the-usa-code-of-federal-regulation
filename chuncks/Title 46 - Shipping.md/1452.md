###### § 28.1110 Waiver approval.

(a)(1) If, within 30 days of receipt of a properly submitted request for a waiver, the Coast Guard does not make a determination whether to approve the request or does not advise the owner, operator, or employer that additional time is needed for consideration, the request will be considered provisionally approved for 90 days from the end of that 30-day period.

(2) If the Coast Guard does not make a determination whether to approve a properly submitted request for a waiver in writing within 30 days of receipt, the owner, operator, or employer must have a copy of the request and supporting documentation available on board the vessel as proof of submission of a request for waiver of the citizenship requirement for unlicensed seamen for that vessel.

(b)(1) If the Coast Guard determines, based on the waiver request, supporting documentation, and any other relevant information, that no qualified U.S. citizen seamen are available, the Coast Guard will grant the waiver to exceed the 25-percent limit for employment of non-permanent resident alien seaman for the period of employment authorized for each alien under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The Coast Guard will issue a letter of approval to the owner, operator, or employer for the applicable vessel(s).

(2) The owner, operator, or employer must have a copy of the waiver approval letter available on board the vessel as proof of waiver of the citizenship requirement for unlicensed seamen for that vessel.
