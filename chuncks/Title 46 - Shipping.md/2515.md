(2) Reject the product on the basis that it cannot be properly identified.

(d) A product conforming to an acceptable material specification may, at the discretion of the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, be accepted without referring to its manufacturer or mill certification, if:

(2) The marking alone is sufficient to identify that specification; and
