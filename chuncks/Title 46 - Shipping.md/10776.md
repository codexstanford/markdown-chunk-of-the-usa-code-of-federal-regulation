Work vests are not accepted in lieu of any of the required number of approved personal flotation devices and must not be worn during drills and emergencies.

(c) The approved buoyant work vests must be stowed separately from personal flotation devices, and in locations where they will not be confused with personal flotation devices.

If a work vest is found not to be in a serviceable condition, then it must be repaired or removed from the vessel. If a work vest is beyond repair, it must be destroyed in the presence of the marine inspector.
