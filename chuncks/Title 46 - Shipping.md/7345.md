(2) Pressure vessel type tanks shall be designed for the maximum pressure to which they may be subjected when pressure is used to discharge the cargo, but in no case shall the design pressure be less than 50 pounds per square inch gauge. All openings shall be in the top of the tank.

(b) Adequate natural ventilation shall be provided for the voids around the cargo tanks while the vessel is underway. If a power ventilation system is installed, all blowers shall be of nonsparking construction. Power driven ventilation equipment shall not be located in the void spaces surrounding the cargo tanks.
