####### § 174.330 Jettisoning of spoil.

(a) When doing the calculations required by § 174.310 for a hopper dredge with bottom doors, it may be assumed that the spoil is jettisoned immediately after damage and that the bottom doors remain open if:

(1) The bottom doors are designed so that they may be fully opened from:

(i) The closed position within two minutes even if the main power source is lost or the bottom door actuating mechanism is damaged; and

(ii) The navigating bridge;

(2) The discharge area through the bottom doors is equal to or greater than 30 percent of the maximum cross sectional area of the hopper measured in a plane parallel to the waterline; and

(3) Asymmetrical jettisoning of the spoil is impossible.

(b) When doing the calculations required by § 174.310 for a hopper dredge with a split hull, it may be assumed that the spoil is jettisoned immediately after damage if-

(1) The hull is designed so that-

(i) The complete separation is effected within two minutes even if the main power source is lost or the actuating means is damaged; and

(ii) The actuating means can be operated from the navigating bridge;

(2) It is shown to the Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, either by calculations or by operational tests, that the hulls can separate sufficiently to allow the dredged material to dump without bridging; and

(3) Asymmetrical jettisoning of the spoil is impossible.
