##### § 326.6 Settlement of claims.

(a) After ascertaining from MARAD the availability of funds, the Agent is authorized to settle individual claims of a P&I insurance nature that do not exceed $5,000. For a settlement in excess of $5,000, the Agent shall obtain MARAD's prior approval through the Director, Office of Trade Analysis and Insurance. If MARAD has placed the P&I insurance with an insurance underwriter, the Agent also shall obtain the prior approval of the underwriter to settle claims.

(b) The amount of individual claims that do not exceed the Agent's limit for settlement shall be chargeable by the Agent to the vessel expense and shall be accounted for in accordance with current accounting instructions of MARAD.

(c) When settling any such claim, the Agent shall advise the claimant that such settlement shall be accounted for in accordance with current accounting instructions, and shall also advise the claimant that such settlement is not to be construed as an admission of liability by or on behalf of the United States, the Agent or any other person.

(d) The Agent shall apply sound judgment and follow standard practices of vessel operators in the settlement or other disposition of such P&I insurance claims, and shall settle such claims only when the settlement is adequately supported by all the facts and circumstances and is in the best interest of the United States.
