The insulating material shall be of an approved type complying with the requirements of subpart 164.009 of subchapter Q (Specifications) of this chapter, and shall be given a vapor proof coating with fire retardant material acceptable to the Commandant. Tanks exposed to the weather shall have the insulation and vapor proof coating covered with a removable sheet metal jacket of not less than 0.083 inch thickness and flashed around all openings so as to be weather tight. Materials other than sheet metal may be used to cover the insulation and vapor proof coating when specifically authorized by the Commandant.
