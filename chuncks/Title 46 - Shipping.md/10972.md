#### PART 170-STABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL INSPECTED VESSELS
##### Subpart F-Determination of Lightweight Displacement and Centers of Gravity
###### § 170.175 Stability test: General.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and in § 170.200, the owner of a vessel must conduct a stability test of the vessel and calculate its vertical and longitudinal centers of gravity and its lightweight displacement.

(b) An authorized Coast Guard representative must be present at each stability test conducted under this section.

(c) The stability test may be dispensed with, or a deadweight survey may be substituted for the stability test, if the Coast Guard has a record of, or is provided with, the approved results of a stability test of a sister vessel.

(d) The stability test of a vessel may be dispensed with if the Coast Guard determines that an accurate estimate of the vessel's lightweight characteristics can be made and that locating the precise position of the vessel's vertical center of gravity is not necessary to ensure that the vessel has adequate stability in all probable loading conditions.
