###### § 4.06-50 Specimen analysis and follow-up procedures.

(a) Each laboratory will provide prompt analysis of specimens collected under this subpart, consistent with the need to develop all relevant information and to produce a complete analysis report.

(b) Reports shall be sent to the Medical Review Officer meeting the requirements of 49 CFR 40.121, as designated by the marine employer submitting the specimen for testing. Wherever a urinalysis report indicates the presence of a dangerous drug or drug metabolite, the Medical Review Officer shall review the report as required by 49 CFR part 40, subpart G, and submit his or her findings to the marine employer. Blood test reports indicating the presence of alcohol shall be similarly reviewed to determine if there is a legitimate medical explanation.

(c) Analysis results which indicate the presence of alcohol, dangerous drugs, or drug metabolites shall not be construed by themselves as constituting a finding that use of drugs or alcohol was the probable cause of a serious marine incident.
