###### § 39.4005 Operational requirements for vapor balancing - TB/ALL.

(a) During a vessel-to-vessel transfer operation, each cargo tank being loaded must be connected by the vapor collection system to a cargo tank that is being discharged.

(b) If the cargo tanks on both the vessel discharging cargo and the vessel receiving cargo are inerted, the following requirements must be met:

(1) Each tank on a vessel receiving cargo, which is connected to the vapor collection system, must be tested prior to cargo transfer to ensure that the oxygen content in the vapor space does not exceed 60 percent by volume of the cargo's minimum oxygen concentration for combustion (MOCC), or 8 percent by volume for vapor of crude oil, gasoline blends, or benzene. The oxygen content of each tank, or each area of a tank formed by each partial bulkhead, must be measured at a point 1 meter (3.28 feet) below the tank top and at a point equal to one-half of the ullage;

(2) Prior to starting transfer operations, the oxygen analyzer required by 46 CFR 39.4003(a) must be tested for proper operation;

(3) During transfer operations the oxygen content of vapors being transferred must be continuously monitored;

(4) Cargo transfer must be terminated if the oxygen content exceeds 60 percent by volume of the cargo's MOCC, or 8 percent by volume for vapor of crude oil, gasoline blends, or benzene;

(5) Transfer operations may resume once the oxygen content in the tanks of the vessel receiving cargo is reduced to 60 percent by volume or less of the cargo's MOCC, or 8 percent by volume or less for vapor of crude oil, gasoline blends, or benzene; and

(6) Prior to starting vapor transfer operations, the vapor transfer hose must be purged of air and inerted.

(c) The isolation valve located on the service vessel required by 46 CFR 39.2001(g) must not be opened until the pressure in the vapor collection system on the vessel receiving cargo exceeds the pressure in the vapor collection system on the vessel discharging cargo.

(d) The vessel discharging cargo must control the cargo transfer rate so that the transfer rate does not exceed-

(1) The authorized maximum discharge rate of the vessel discharging cargo;

(2) The authorized maximum loading rate of the vessel receiving cargo; or

(3) The processing rate of the approved vessel vapor processing system, if one is used to process the vapor collected during the transfer operations.

(e) The pressure in the vapor space of any cargo tank connected to the vapor collection line on either the vessel receiving cargo or the vessel discharging cargo must not exceed 80 percent of the lowest setting of any pressure relief valve during ballasting or cargo transfer.

(f) Impressed current cathodic protection systems must be de-energized during cargo transfer operations.

(g) Tank washing is prohibited unless the cargo tanks on both the vessel discharging cargo and the vessel receiving cargo are inerted, or the tank is isolated from the vapor collection line.
