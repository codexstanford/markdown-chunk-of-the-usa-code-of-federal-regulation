####### § 154.708 Cargo boil-off as fuel: Valves.

(a) Gas fuel lines to the gas consuming equipment must have two fail-closed automatic valves in series. A third valve, designed to fail-open, must vent that portion of pipe between the two series valves to the open atmosphere.

(b) The valves under paragraph (a) of this section must be arranged so that loss of boiler forced draft, flame failure, or abnormal gas fuel supply pressure automatically causes the two series valves to close and the vent valve to open. The function of one of the series valves and the vent valve may be performed by a single three-way valve.

(c) A master gas fuel valve must be located outside the machinery space, but be operable from inside the machinery space and at the valve. The valve must automatically close when there is:

(1) A gas leak detected under § 154.706(a)(2) or § 154.706(b);

(2) Loss of the ventilation under § 154.706(a)(2) or § 154.707(c); or

(3) Loss of inert gas pressure within the double-walled piping system under § 154.706(a)(1).
