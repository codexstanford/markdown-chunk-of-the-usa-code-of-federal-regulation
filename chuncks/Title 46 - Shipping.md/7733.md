####### § 154.345 Air locks.

(a) An air lock may be used for access from a gas-dangerous zone on the weather deck to a gas-safe space.

(b) Each air lock must:

(1) Consist of two steel doors, at least 1.5 m (4.9 ft.) but not more than 2.5 m (8.2 ft.) apart, each gasketed and tight when tested with a fire hose at not less 207 kPa gauge (30 psig);

(2) Have self-closing doors with no latches or other devices for holding them open;

(3) Have an audible and visual alarm on both sides which are actuated when both door securing devices are in other than the fully closed position at the same time;

(4) Have mechanical ventilation in the space between the doors from a gas-safe area;

(5) Have a pressure greater than that of the gas-dangerous area on the weather deck;

(6) Have the rate of air change in the space between the doors of at least 8 changes per hour; and

(7) Have the space between the doors monitored for cargo vapor leaks under § 154.1350.

(c) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, no gas-safe space on a liquefied flammable gas carrier may have an air lock unless the space:

(1) Is mechanically ventilated to make the pressure in the space greater than that in the air lock; and

(2) Has a means of automatically de-energizing all electrical equipment that is not explosion-proof in the space when the pressure in the space falls to or below the pressure in the air lock.
