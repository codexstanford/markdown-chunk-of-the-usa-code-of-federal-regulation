(c) The master shall keep records of these tests and inspections, showing the dates of their performance, the number or other identification of each unit undergoing them, and the name of the person or company conducting them. The records must be made available to the marine inspector upon request and must be kept for the period of validity of the vessel's current Certificate of Inspection.
