###### § 95.05-3 Sample extraction smoke detection systems.

(a) For vessels contracted for on or after January 18, 2017, a sample extraction smoke detection system must be installed in accordance with chapter 10 of the FSS Code (incorporated by reference, see § 95.01-2).

(b) Periodically, the FSS Code defers to "the Administration." For U.S. flag vessels, "the Administration" is the United States Coast Guard. The following requirements are provided for the provisions of Chapter 10 that defer to the Administration:

(1) For sequential scanning systems under FSS Code, chapter 10, paragraph 2.1.2, a satisfactory overall response time will be achieved by limiting the maximum allowable interval to 2 minutes.

(2) Under the FSS Code, chapter 10, paragraph 2.2.2, fans of sufficient capacity to provide a satisfactory overall response time will signal an alarm within 3 minutes upon introduction of smoke at the most remote accumulator on a vehicle deck and within 5 minutes upon introduction of smoke at the most remote accumulator in container and general cargo holds.

(3) Means provided to isolate smoke accumulators from liquid or refrigerated cargoes must be to the satisfaction of the Commanding Officer of the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Center.

(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in FSS Code chapter 10, periodic testing of sample extraction smoke detection systems must be conducted as part of the annual inspection and include inspection of all piping, valves, controls and alarms, and by introduction of smoke into the accumulators.
