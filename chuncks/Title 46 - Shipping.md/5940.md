(c) The means used to attach the float-free link to the vessel must:

(1) Have a breaking strength of at least the breaking strength of the painter;

(2) If synthetic, be of a dark color or of a type certified to be resistant to deterioration from ultraviolent light; and

(3) If metal, be corrosion resistant.

(d) If the life float or buoyant apparatus does not have a painter attachment fitting, a means for attaching the painter must be provided by a wire or line which:

(1) Encircles the body of the device;

(2) Will not slip off;
