####### § 108.449 Piping tests.

(a) Each test prescribed in (b), (c), and (d) of this section must be performed upon completion of the piping installation.

(b) When tested with COor other inert gas under a pressure of 70 kilograms per square centimeter (1000 pounds per square inch), with no additional gas introduced into the system, the leakage in the piping from the cylinders to the stop valves in the manifold must not allow a pressure drop of more than 10.5 kilograms per square centimeter (150 pounds per square inch) per minute for a 2 minute period.

(c) When tested with COor other inert gas under a pressure of 42 kilograms per square centimeter (600 pounds per square inch), with no additional gas introduced into the system, the leakage in each branch line must not allow a pressure drop of more than 10.5 kilograms per square centimeter (150 pounds per square inch) per minute for a 2-minute period. The distribution piping must be capped within the protected space.

(d) Small independent systems protecting emergency generator rooms, lamp lockers and similar small spaces need not meet the tests prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section if they are tested by blowing out the piping with air at a pressure of at least 7 kilograms per square centimeter (100 pounds per square inch).
