###### § 182.730 Nonferrous metallic piping materials.

(a) Nonferrous metallic piping materials are acceptable for use in the following:

(1) Non-vital systems;

(2) Aluminum fuel piping, if of a minimum of Schedule 80 wall thickness on an aluminum hulled vessel;

(3) Aluminum bilge, ballast, and firemain piping on an aluminum hulled vessel;

(4) If acceptable to the cognizant OCMI, nonferrous metallic piping with a melting temperature above 927 &#xB0;C (1,700 &#xB0;F) may be used in vital systems that are deemed to be galvanically compatible; and

(5) Other uses specifically accepted by the cognizant OCMI.

(b) Where nonferrous metallic material is permitted for use in piping systems by this subpart, the restrictions in this paragraph apply:

(1) Provisions must be made to protect piping systems using aluminum alloys in high risk fire areas due to the low melting point of aluminum alloys;

(2) Provisions must be made to prevent or mitigate the effect of galvanic corrosion due to the relative solution potentials of copper, aluminum, and alloys of copper and aluminum, which are used in conjunction with each other, steel, or other metals and their alloys;

(3) A suitable thread compound must be used in making up threaded joints in aluminum pipe to prevent seizing. Pipe in the annealed temper must not be threaded;

(4) The use of aluminum alloys with a copper content exceeding 0.6 percent is prohibited; and

(5) The use of cast aluminum alloys in hydraulic fluid power systems must be in accordance with the requirements of § 58.30-15(f) in subchapter F of this chapter.
