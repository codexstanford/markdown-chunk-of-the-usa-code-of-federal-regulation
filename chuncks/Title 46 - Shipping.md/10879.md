(a) The master or person in charge shall ensure that the vessel's firefighting equipment is at all times ready for use and that all firefighting equipment required by the regulations in this subchapter is provided, maintained, and replaced as indicated.

(b) The master or person in charge shall have performed at least once every 12 months the tests and inspections of all hand portable fire extinguishers, semiportable fire extinguishing systems, and fixed fire extinguishing systems on board as described in § 169.247 of this subchapter. The master or person in charge shall keep records of the tests and inspections showing the dates when performed, the number and/or other identification of each unit tested and inspected, and the name(s) of the person(s) and/or company conducting the tests and inspections. These records must be made available to the marine inspectors upon request and must be kept for the period of validity of the vessel's current certificate of inspection. Conducting these tests and inspections does not relieve the master or person in charge of his responsibility to maintain this firefighting equipment in proper condition at all times.
