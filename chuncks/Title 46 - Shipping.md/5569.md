###### § 112.50-3 Hydraulic starting.

A hydraulic starting system must meet the following:

(a) The hydraulic starting system must be a self-contained system that provides the cranking torque and engine starting RPM recommended by the engine manufacturer. The hydraulic starting system must be capable of six consecutive starts, unless a second, separate source of starting energy capable of three consecutive starts is provided. A second, separate source of starting energy may provide three of the required six starts. If a second source is provided, the hydraulic system need only provide three consecutive starts.

(b) The stored hydraulic pressure must be automatically maintained within the predetermined pressure limits.

(c) The means of automatically maintaining the hydraulic system within the predetermined pressure limits must be electrically energized from the final emergency bus.

(d) There must be a means to manually recharge the hydraulic system.

(e) Charging of the hydraulic starting system must not cause insufficient hydraulic pressure for engine starting.
