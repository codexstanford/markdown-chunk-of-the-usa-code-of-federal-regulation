###### § 503.74 Procedures for closing a portion or portions of a meeting or a portion or portions of a series of meetings on agency initiated requests.

(a) Any member of the agency, the Managing Director or the General Counsel of the agency may request that any portion or portions of a series of meetings be closed to public observation for any of the reasons provided in § 503.73 by submitting such request in writing to the Secretary of the agency in sufficient time to allow the Secretary to schedule a timely vote on the request pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Upon receipt of any request made under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary of the agency shall schedule a time at which the members of the agency shall vote upon the request, which vote shall take place not later then eight (8) days prior to the scheduled meeting of the agency.

(c) At the time the Secretary schedules a time for an agency vote as described in paragraph (b) of this section, he or she shall forward the request to the General Counsel of the agency who shall act upon such request as provided in § 503.77.

(d) At the time schedule d by the Secretary as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the members of the agency, upon consideration of the request submitted under paragraph (a) of this section and consideration of the certified opinion of the General Counsel of the agency provided to the members under § 503.77, shall vote upon that request. That vote shall determine whether or not any portion or portions of a meeting may be closed to public observation for any of the reasons provided in § 503.73, and whether or not the public interest requires that the portion or portions of the meeting or meetings remain open, notwithstanding the applicability of any of the reasons provided in § 503.73 permitting the closing of any meeting to public observation.

(e) In the case of a vote on a request under this section to close to public observation a portion or portions of a meeting, no such portion or portions of any meeting may be closed unless, by a vote on the issues described in paragraph (d) of this section, a majority of the entire membership of the agency shall vote to close such portion or portions of a meeting by recorded vote.

(f) In the case of a vote on a request under this section to close to public observation a portion or portions of a series of meetings as defined in § 503.71, no such portion or portions of a series of meetings may be closed unless, by a vote on the issues described in paragraph (d) of this section, a majority of the entire membership of the agency shall vote to close such portion or portions of a series of meetings. A determination to close to public observation a portion or portions of a series of meetings may be accomplished by a single vote on each of the issues described in paragraph (d) of this section, provided that the vote of each member of the agency shall be recorded and the vote shall be cast by each member and not by proxy vote.
