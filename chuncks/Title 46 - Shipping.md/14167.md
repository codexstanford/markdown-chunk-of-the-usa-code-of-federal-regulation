#### PART 356 - REQUIREMENTS FOR VESSELS OF 100 FEET OR GREATER IN REGISTERED LENGTH TO OBTAIN A FISHERY ENDORSEMENT TO THE VESSEL'S DOCUMENTATION
##### Subpart B - Ownership and Control
###### § 356.9 Tiered ownership structures.

Non-Citizens may not own or control, either directly through the first tier of ownership or in the aggregate through an interest in other entities at various tiers, more than 25% of the interest in an entity which owns a Fishing Industry Vessel. The prohibition against Non-Citizens owning or controlling more than 25%, in the aggregate, of the interest in an entity that owns a Fishing Industry Vessel means, for example, that:

(a) Non-Citizens that own or control a 25% stake in the ownership entity of a Fishing Industry Vessel at the first tier may not have any interest whatsoever in any entity that is being relied upon to establish the required 75% U.S. Citizen ownership; and

(b) Non-Citizens that own or control less than a 25% stake at the first tier may participate in the ownership and control of other entities that are being relied upon to establish the required 75% U.S. Citizen ownership and control at the first tier. However, the total ownership and control by Non-Citizens of the entity owning a Fishing Industry Vessel may not exceed 25% in the aggregate as computed by MARAD.
