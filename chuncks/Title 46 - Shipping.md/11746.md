###### § 185.612 Fire protection equipment.

(a) Complete but simple instructions for the operation of a fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be located in a conspicuous place at or near each pull box and stop valve control and in the space where the extinguishing agent cylinders are stored. If the storage cylinders are separate from the protected space, the instructions must also include a schematic diagram of the system and instructions detailing alternate methods of releasing the extinguishing agent should the local manual release or stop valve controls fail to operate. Each control valve to a distribution line must be marked to indicate the space served.

(b) An alarm for a fixed gas fire extinguishing system must be clearly and conspicuously marked "WHEN ALARM SOUNDS-VACATE AT ONCE. CARBON DIOXIDE BEING RELEASED". Where a different extinguishing agent is installed, that agent shall be marked in place of "carbon dioxide."

(c) Each distribution line valve of a fixed gas fire extinguishing system and the fire main, must be plainly, conspicuously, and permanently marked indicating the space served.

(d) An indicator for an automatic sprinkler system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters "SPRINKLER ALARM".

(e) An indicator for a fire detection and alarm system must be conspicuously marked in clearly legible letters "FIRE ALARM".

(f) The control cabinets or spaces containing valves, manifolds or controls for the various fire extinguishing systems must be marked in conspicuous red letters at least 2 inches high: "[STEAM/CARBON DIOXIDE/CLEAN AGENT/FOAM/WATER SPRAY-as appropriate] FIRE APPARATUS.".

(g) Each entrance to a space storing carbon dioxide cylinders, a space protected by carbon dioxide systems, or any space into which carbon dioxide might migrate must be conspicuously marked as follows:

(1) Spaces storing carbon dioxide-"CARBON DIOXIDE GAS CAN CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH. VENTILATE THE AREA BEFORE ENTERING. A HIGH CONCENTRATION CAN OCCUR IN THIS AREA AND CAN CAUSE SUFFOCATION.".

(2) Spaces protected by carbon dioxide-"CARBON DIOXIDE GAS CAN CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH. WHEN ALARM OPERATES OR WINTERGREEN SCENT IS DETECTED, DO NOT ENTER UNTIL VENTILATED. LOCK OUT SYSTEM WHEN SERVICING." The reference to wintergreen scent may be omitted for carbon dioxide systems not required to have odorizing units and not equipped with such units.

(3) Spaces into which carbon dioxide might migrate-"CARBON DIOXIDE GAS CAN CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH. DISCHARGE INTO NEARBY SPACE CAN COLLECT HERE. WHEN ALARM OPERATES OR WINTERGREEN SCENT IS DETECTED VACATE IMMEDIATELY." The reference to wintergreen scent may be omitted for carbon dioxide systems not required to have odorizing units and not equipped with such units.
