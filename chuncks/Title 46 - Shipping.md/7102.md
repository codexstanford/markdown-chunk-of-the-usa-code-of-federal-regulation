###### § 148.260 Ferrous metal.

(a) This part does not apply to the stowage and transportation in bulk of stainless steel borings, shavings, turnings, or cuttings; nor does this part apply to an unmanned barge on a voyage entirely on the navigable waters of United States.

(b) Ferrous metal may not be stowed or transported in bulk unless the following conditions are met:

(1) All wooden sweat battens, dunnage, and debris must be removed from the hold before the ferrous metal is loaded;

(2) If weather is inclement during loading, hatches must be covered or otherwise protected to keep the material dry;

(3) During loading and transporting, the bilge of each hold in which ferrous metal is stowed or will be stowed must be kept as dry as practical;

(4) During loading, the ferrous metal must be compacted in the hold as frequently as practicable with a bulldozer or other means that provides equivalent surface compaction;

(5) No other material may be loaded in a hold containing ferrous metal unless-

(i) The material to be loaded in the same hold with the ferrous metal is not a material listed in Table 148.10 of this part or a readily combustible material;

(ii) The loading of the ferrous metal is completed first; and

(iii) The temperature of the ferrous metal in the hold is below 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F) or has not increased in eight hours before the loading of the other material; and

(6) During loading, the temperature of the ferrous metal in the pile being loaded must be below 55 &#xB0;C (131 &#xB0;F).

(c) The master of a vessel that is loading or transporting a ferrous metal must ensure that the temperature of the ferrous metal is taken-

(1) Before loading;

(2) During loading, in each hold and pile being loaded, at least once every twenty-four hours and, if the temperature is rising, as often as is necessary to ensure that the requirements of this section are met; and

(3) After loading, in each hold, at least once every 24 hours.

(d) During loading, if the temperature of the ferrous metal in a hold is 93 &#xB0;C (200 &#xB0;F) or higher, the master must notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port and suspend loading until the Captain of the Port is satisfied that the temperature of the ferrous metal is 88 &#xB0;C (190 &#xB0;F) or less.

(e) After loading ferrous metal-

(1) If the temperature of the ferrous metal in each hold is 65 &#xB0;C (150 &#xB0;F) or above, the master must notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, and the vessel must remain in the port area until the Captain of the Port is satisfied that the temperature of ferrous metal has shown a downward trend below 65 &#xB0;C (150 &#xB0;F) for at least eight hours after completion of loading of the hold; or

(2) If the temperature of the ferrous metal in each hold is less than 88 &#xB0;C (190 &#xB0;F) and has shown a downward trend for at least eight hours after the completion of loading, the master must notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, and the vessel must remain in the port area until the Captain of the Port confirms that the vessel is sailing directly to another port, no further than 12 hours sailing time, for the purpose of loading more ferrous metal in bulk or to completely off-load the ferrous metal.

(f) Except for shipments of ferrous metal in bulk which leave the port of loading under the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, if after the vessel leaves the port, the temperature of the ferrous metal in the hold rises above 65 &#xB0;C (150 &#xB0;F), the master must notify the nearest Coast Guard Captain of the Port as soon as possible of-

(1) The name, nationality, and position of the vessel;

(2) The most recent temperature taken;

(3) The length of time that the temperature has been above 65 &#xB0;C (150 &#xB0;F) and the rate of rise, if any;

(4) The port where the ferrous metal was loaded and the destination of the ferrous metal;

(5) The last port of call of the vessel and its next port of call;

(6) What action has been taken; and

(7) Whether any other cargo is endangered.
