###### § 182.720 Nonmetallic piping materials.

(a) Rigid nonmetallic materials (plastic) may be used only non-vital systems and in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Alternatively, piping systems meeting the requirements of § 56.60-25(a) of this chapter may be used, provided that the installation requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are met.

(b) Flexible nonmetallic materials (hose) may be used in vital and non-vital systems where permitted by paragraph (e) of this section.

(c) Nonmetallic piping must not be used in gasoline or diesel fuel systems. Flexible nonmetallic materials (hose) may be used where permitted by paragraph (e) of this section.

(d) Where rigid nonmetallic material (plastic) is permitted for use in piping systems by this section, the following restrictions apply:

(1) Penetrations of required watertight decks and bulkheads by any rigid plastic pipe are prohibited unless the following requirements are met:

(i) Each penetration must be accomplished using an acceptable metallic through deck or through bulkhead fitting that is welded or otherwise attached to the bulkhead or deck by an accepted method; and

(ii) One or more metallic shutoff valves must be installed adjacent to the fitting in one of the following ways:

(A) Only one metallic shutoff valve must be installed if it is operable from above the bulkhead deck;

(B) If two metallic shutoff valves are installed, one on either side of the bulkhead, they need not be operable from above the bulkhead deck provided immediate access to both is possible; or

(C) Where both plastic and metallic materials are used in piping that penetrates a bulkhead, and the two materials exist entirely on opposite sides of the bulkhead, a metallic shutoff valve must be installed at the bulkhead in the metallic part of the system, with the valve being capable of operation from above the bulkhead deck, or locally if immediate access is possible;

(2) Protection from mechanical damage must be specifically considered and all protective covering or shields must be installed to the satisfaction of the cognizant OCMI;

(3) Through hull fittings and shutoff valves must be metallic. In the case of nonmetallic hulls, materials that will afford an equal degree of safety and heat resistivity as that afforded by the hull may be approved; and

(4) The material specification must show that the rigid nonmetallic material possesses characteristics adequate for its intended service and environment and must be approved for use by the cognizant OCMI.

(e) Where flexible nonmetallic hose is permitted for use in piping systems by this section, it must meet SAE J-1942 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 175.600) or be specifically approved by the Commandant. The following restrictions apply:

(1) Flexible nonmetallic hose must be complete with factory-assembled end fittings requiring no further adjustment of the fittings on the hose, or field attachable type fittings may be used. Hose end fittings must comply with SAE J-1475 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 175.600). Field attachable fittings must be installed following the manufacturer's recommended practice. If special equipment is required, such as crimping machines, it must be of the type and design specified by the manufacturer. If field attachable type fittings are used, each hose assembly must be individually hydrostatically tested to twice the maximum operating pressure of the system;

(2) Flexible nonmetallic hose may be used in non-vital water and pneumatic systems, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section. Unreinforced hoses are limited to a maximum service pressure of 349 kPa (50 psig), reinforced hoses are limited to a maximum service pressure of 1,034 kPa (150 psig); and

(3) Flexible nonmetallic hose may be used in lube oil, fuel oil and fluid power systems, subject to the following requirements:

(i) Flexible hose may only be used at a pressure not to exceed the manufacturer's rating and must have a high resistance to saltwater, petroleum oils, and vibration;

(ii) Flexible hose runs must be visible, easily accessible, protected from mechanical damage, and must not penetrate watertight decks or bulkheads;

(iii) Flexible hose must be fabricated with an inner tube and a cover of synthetic rubber or other suitable material reinforced with wire braid;

(iv) Flexible hose used for alcohol-gasoline blend fuels must meet the permeability requirements specified in 33 CFR part 183, subpart J; and

(v) For the purpose of flexibility only, flexible hose installed in lengths of not more than 760 millimeters (30 inches) and subject to pressures of not more than 35 kPa (5 psig), may meet the following requirements:

(A) Suitable compression type connection fittings may be accepted;

(B) Flexible hose designed for use with hose clamps may be installed with two clamps, at both ends of the hose, which:
