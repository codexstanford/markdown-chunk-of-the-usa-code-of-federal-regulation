###### § 199.220 Survival craft and rescue boat embarkation arrangements.

(a) Survival craft embarkation arrangements must be designed for-

(1) Each lifeboat to be boarded and launched either directly from the stowed position or from an embarkation deck, but not both; and

(2) Davit-launched liferafts to be boarded and launched from a position immediately adjacent to the stowed positions or from a position where, as described under § 199.130(c)(4), the liferaft is transferred before launching.

(b) Each rescue boat must be able to be boarded and launched directly from the stowed position with the number of persons assigned to crew the rescue boat on board. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the rescue boat is also a lifeboat and the other lifeboats are boarded and launched from an embarkation deck, the arrangements must be such that the rescue boat can also be boarded and launched from the embarkation deck.
