###### Sec. 2 Bank account.

A separate joint bank account will be maintained in a depository or depositories designated by the agent and approved by the National Shipping Authority (referred to in this order as the owner), into which all collections under the agency agreement will be deposited and from which disbursements in connection with the activities, maintenance and business of the vessels thereunder will be made. Upon designation by the agent and approval by the owner of the depository or depositories, the owner will issue an order for the establishment of the joint bank account. The order will set forth the conditions governing the establishment and maintenance of the account and the making of deposits therein and withdrawals therefrom. A signed copy of the order of the owner will be furnished the agent and the agent promptly shall adopt, through its Board of Directors, a resolution satisfactory in form and substance to the owner, authorizing the establishment and maintenance of the account in conformity with the action of the owner. A signed copy of the order of the owner and a certified copy of the resolution of the agent will be furnished by the owner to the depository for its guidance in maintaining the fund and honoring instruments of withdrawal. The order will provide, among other things, that:

(a) Withdrawals from this bank account may be made by the agent without the countersignature of the owner for disbursements in connection with the activities, maintenance and business of the vessels assigned under agency agreements, except disbursements involving payments to the agent directly, or to any other persons specifically designated by the Director, National Shipping Authority, in which instances the countersignature of a designated representative of the owner will be required, (b) withdrawals may be made from the account by the owner without the countersignature of the agent whenever and to the extent the owner shall determine that the balance in the account in excess of current operating requirements warrants such action, (c) the bank shall have no rights against the joint account on account of indebtedness of the agent either by way of set-off or otherwise, (d) the bank may receive for deposit in the joint account any funds tendered to it by any person with instructions that the same be deposited in the said account, and the bank shall have no responsibility to inquire as to the source of such funds, and (e) the bank shall disburse funds from the joint account in accordance with checks, drafts, or other orders for the payment of money, drawn as provided in the order, without making any inquiry as to the purpose or use to which such withdrawals are to be put.
