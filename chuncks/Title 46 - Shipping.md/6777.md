(b) For the purposes of this subchapter, if items are recorded electronically in a TVR or other record as specified by the TSMS applicable to the towing vessel, these electronic entries must include the date and time of entry and name of the person making the entry. If after an entry has been made, someone responsible for entries determines there is an error in an entry, any entries to correct the error must include the date and time of entry and name of the person making the correction and must preserve a record of the original entry being corrected.

Note to § 140.915. For towing vessels subject to 46 U.S.C. 11301, there are statutory requirements in that U.S. Code section for additional items that must be entered in the official logbook. Regarding requirements outside this subchapter, such as requirements in 33 CFR 151.25 to make entries in an oil record book, § 140.915 does not change those requirements.
