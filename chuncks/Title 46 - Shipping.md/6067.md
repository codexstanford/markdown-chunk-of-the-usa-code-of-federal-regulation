###### § 121.620 Propulsion engine control systems.

(a) A vessel must have two independent means of controlling each propulsion engine. Control must be provided for the engine speed, direction of shaft rotation, and engine shutdown.

(1) One of the means may be the ability to readily disconnect the remote engine control linkage to permit local operation.

(2) A multiple engine vessel with independent remote propulsion control for each engine need not have a second means of controlling each engine.

(b) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a vessel must have a reliable means for shutting down a propulsion engine, at the main pilot house control station, which is independent of the engine's speed control.

(c) A propulsion engine control system, including pilothouse control, must be designed so that a loss of power to the control system does not result in an increase in shaft speed or propeller pitch.

(d) All microprocessor or computer based systems must meet the requirements of part 62 in subchapter F of this chapter.
