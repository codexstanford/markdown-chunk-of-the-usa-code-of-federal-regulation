###### § 154.24 Foreign flag vessel: IMO Certificate.

(a) An IMO Certificate issued under the IMO Resolution A.328(IX),"Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk, 1975" is usually sufficient evidence of compliance with this part for the Coast Guard to endorse a foreign flag vessel's Certificate of Compliance with the name of each cargo in Table 4 (follows § 154.1872) that is listed on the IMO Certificate, if the information listed in item 3 of the IMO Certificate shows that-

(1) The design ambient temperatures meet § 154.174 and § 154.176;

(2) The cargo tank design stress factors and resulting MARVS of independent tanks type B or C meet § 154.447 or § 154.450; and

(3) The cargo tank MARVS of a type IIPG ship meets § 172.175(c) of this chapter.

(b) If a foreign flag existing gas vessel meets § 154.12 (b), (c), or (d), the vessel's IMO Certificate issued under the IMO "Code for Existing Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk, 1975" is usually sufficient evidence of compliance with the requirements of § 154.12(e) for the Coast Guard to endorse the Certificate of Compliance with the name of each cargo in Table 4 (follows § 154.1872) that is listed on the IMO Certificate; however if a foreign flag existing gas vessel does not meet § 154.12 (b), (c), or (d), an IMO Certificate issued under the IMO "Code for Existing Ships Carrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk, 1975" is not acceptable evidence of compliance with the requirements of this part for the endorsement of a Certificate of Compliance.
