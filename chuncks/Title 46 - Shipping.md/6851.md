Electrical equipment, piping for flammable or combustible liquid, seawater cooling, or fire-fighting systems must be provided with isolation devices and markings as follows:

(a) Electrical equipment must be provided with circuit isolation and must be marked as described in § 143.400.

(b) Electrical panels or other enclosures containing more than one source of power must be fitted with a sign warning persons of this condition and identifying where to secure all sources.

(c) Piping for flammable or combustible liquid, seawater cooling, or firefighting systems must be fitted with isolation valves that are clearly marked by labeling or color coding that enables the crew to identify its function.

(d) Any piping system that penetrates the hull below the waterline must be fitted with an accessible valve, located as close to the hull penetration as is practicable, for preventing the accidental admission of water into the vessel either through such pipes or in the event of a fracture of such pipe. The valve must be clearly marked by labeling or color coding that enables the crew to identify its function.

(e) Color coding required by this section may be met by complying with coding standards contained in the ISO 14726:2008(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 136.112 of this subchapter), or in accordance with the TSMS applicable to the vessel.
