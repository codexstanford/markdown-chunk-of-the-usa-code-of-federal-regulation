##### § 204.5 Notification to claimant of action on claim.

(a) If a claim is approved (either for the amount claimed or less than such full amount), the claimant, prior to the disbursement of an award, shall sign a document releasing the United States, its agents and employees from all further claims relating to the incident giving rise to the approved claim.

(b) If the claim is finally denied, the official vested with such authority shall inform the claimant by certified or registered mail of the final denial of the claim. Notification of final denial shall include a statement that a claimant who does not accept or is dissatisfied with the action may institute suit against the United States not later than six months after the date of mailing of the notice of final denial.

(c) A claimant may regard the failure of the Maritime Administration to make a final disposition of a claim within six months after the date of receipt of the claim by the Maritime Administration as a final denial for the purpose of filing suit.
