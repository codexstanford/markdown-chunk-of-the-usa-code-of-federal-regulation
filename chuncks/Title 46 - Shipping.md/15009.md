(b) The General Counsel shall designate an attorney to represent any Commission staff personnel subpoenaed under this section. The attorney so designated shall not thereafter participate in the Commission's decision-making process concerning any issue in the proceeding.

(c) Rulings of the presiding officer issued under § 502.135(a) shall become final rulings of the Commission unless an appeal is filed within ten (10) days after date of issuance of such rulings or unless the Commission, on its own motion, reverses, modifies, or stays such rulings within twenty (20) days of their issuance. Replies to appeals may be filed within ten (10) days. No ruling of the presiding officer shall be effective until twenty (20) days from date of issuance unless the Commission otherwise directs.
