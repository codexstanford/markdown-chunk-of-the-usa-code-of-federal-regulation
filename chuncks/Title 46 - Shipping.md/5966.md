(2) A space containing an internal combustion engine of more than 37.3 kW (50 hp); and

(3) A space containing an oil fired boiler.

(d) Vessels described by 46 CFR 114.110(e) must have an interconnected fire detection system in compliance with 46 CFR 181.450 installed in all enclosed areas where passengers and crew have routine access, including accommodation spaces and machinery spaces.
