(2) The impeller and housing made of non-ferrous material.

(3) The impeller and housing made of austenitic stainless steel.

(4) The impeller and housing made of ferrous material with at least 13mm (0.512 in.) tip clearance.

(j) No ventilation fan may have any combination of fixed or rotating components made of an aluminum or magnesium alloy and ferrous fixed or rotating components.

(k) Each ventilation intake and exhaust must have a protective metal screen of not more than 13mm (0.512 in.) square mesh.
