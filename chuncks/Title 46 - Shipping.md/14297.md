###### § 385.34 Responsibility for issuing solicitations for proposals or applications.

(a) It is MarAd policy to favor solicitation of proposals or applications, where discretionary assistance awards are available, in preference to relying on unsolicited proposals, in order to maximize opportunities for open participation by the public in MarAd assistance awards.

(b) The Awards Officer shall be responsible for issuing solicitations, announcements, or the like, which call for the submission of proposals and applications by a certain due date which, if favorably acted upon by MarAd, may result in assistance awards.
