###### § 95.15-35 Enclosure openings.

(a) Where mechanical ventilation is provided for spaces other than cargo and similar spaces which are protected by a carbon dioxide extinguishing system, provisions shall be made so that the ventilation system is automatically shut down with the operation of the system to that space.

(b) Where natural ventilation is provided for spaces protected by a carbon dioxide extinguishing system, provisions shall be made for easily and effectively closing off the ventilation.

(c) Means shall be provided for closing all other openings to the space protected from outside such space. In this respect, relatively tight doors, shutters, or dampers shall be provided for openings in the lower portion of the space. The construction shall be such that openings in the upper portion of the space can be closed off either by permanently installed means or by the use of canvas or other material which is normally carried by the vessel.
