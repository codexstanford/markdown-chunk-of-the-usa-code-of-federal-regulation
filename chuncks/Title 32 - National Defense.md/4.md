(c) Nomination of candidate programs must be accompanied by a list of waivers being requested to Statutes, FAR, DFARS, DoD Directivesand Instructions,and where applicable, DoD Component regulations. Waivers being requested must be accompanied by rationale and justification for the waiver. The justification must include:

(1) The provision of law proposed to be waived or limited.

(2) The effects of the provision of law on the acquisition, including specific examples.

(3) The actions taken to ensure that the waiver or limitation will not reduce the efficiency, integrity, and effectiveness of the acquisition process used for the defense acquisition program; and

(4) A discussion of the efficiencies or savings, if any, that will result from the waiver or limitation.

(d) No nominated program shall be accepted until the Under Secretary of Defense has determined that the candidate program is properly planned.
