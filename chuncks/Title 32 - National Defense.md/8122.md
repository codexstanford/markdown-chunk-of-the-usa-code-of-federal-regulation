###### § 223.4 Policy.

It is DoD policy that:

(a) Unauthorized dissemination of unclassified information pertaining to security measures, including security plans, procedures, and equipment, for the physical protection of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody is prohibited.

(b) Unclassified information shall be protected as DoD UCNI based on a determination that the unauthorized dissemination of such information could reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect on the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security by significantly increasing the likelihood of the illegal production of nuclear weapons or the theft, diversion, or sabotage of DoD SNM, SNM equipment, SNM facilities, or nuclear weapons in DoD custody.

(c) Unclassified information regarding physical protection of DoD SNM and nuclear weapons in DoD custody shall be made publicly available to the fullest extent possible by applying the minimum restrictions, consistent with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 128, necessary to protect the health and safety of the public or the common defense and security.

(d) This part and title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 1017 shall be used as guidance for handling DOE UCNI that is under DoD control.

(e) This part does not prevent a determination that information previously determined to be DoD UCNI is classified information in accordance with Volume 1 of DoD Manual 5200.01and other applicable standards of classification.
