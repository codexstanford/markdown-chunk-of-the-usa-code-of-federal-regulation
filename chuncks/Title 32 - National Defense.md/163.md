####### § 22.305 General policy and requirement for competition.

(a) It is DoD policy to maximize use of competition in the award of grants and cooperative agreements. This also conforms with:

(1) 31 U.S.C. 6301(3), which encourages the use of competition in awarding all grants and cooperative agreements.

(2) 10 U.S.C. 2374(a), which sets out Congressional policy that any new grant for research, development, test, or evaluation be awarded through merit-based selection procedures.

(b) Grants officers shall use merit-based, competitive procedures (as defined by § 22.315) to award grants and cooperative agreements:

(1) In every case where required by statute (e.g., 10 U.S.C. 2361, as implemented in § 22.310, for certain grants to institutions of higher education).

(2) To the maximum extent practicable in all cases where not required by statute.
