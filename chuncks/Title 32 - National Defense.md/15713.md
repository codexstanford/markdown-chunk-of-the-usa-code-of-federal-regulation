###### § 1901.32 Requests for expedited processing.

(a) All requests will be handled in the order received on a strictly "first-in, first-out" basis. Exceptions to this rule will only be made in circumstances that the Agency deems to be exceptional. In making this determination, the Agency shall consider and must decide in the affirmative on all of the following factors:

(1) That there is a genuine need for the records; and

(2) That the personal need is exceptional; and

(3) That there are no alternative forums for the records sought; and

(4) That it is reasonably believed that substantive records relevant to the stated needs may exist and be deemed releasable.

(b) In sum, requests shall be considered for expedited processing only when health, humanitarian, or due process considerations involving possible deprivation of life or liberty create circumstances of exceptional urgency and extraordinary need. In accordance with established judicial precedent, requests more properly the scope of requests under the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure (or equivalent state rules) will not be granted expedited processing under this or related (e.g., Freedom of Information Act) provisions unless expressly ordered by a federal court of competent jurisdiction.
