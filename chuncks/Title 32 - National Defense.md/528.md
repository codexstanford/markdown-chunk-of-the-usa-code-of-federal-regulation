####### The Award Document
######## § 37.1005 What are my general responsibilities concerning the award document?

You are responsible for ensuring that the award document is complete and accurate. Your objective is to create a document that:

(a) Addresses all issues;

(b) States requirements directly. It is not helpful to readers to incorporate statutes or rules by reference, without sufficient explanation of the requirements. You generally should not incorporate clauses from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR parts 1-53) or Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (48 CFR parts 201-253), because those provisions are designed for procurement contracts that are used to acquire goods and services, rather than for TIAs or other assistance instruments.

(c) Is written in clear and concise language, to minimize potential ambiguity.
