(1) Meet Military Service readiness standards of mental, moral, professional, and physical fitness and possess the military qualifications required in the various ranks, ratings, and specialties.

(2) Are available immediately for active duty (AD) during a mobilization or as otherwise required by law.

(b) Ready Reserve members whose immediate recall to AD during an emergency would create an extreme personal or community hardship shall be transferred to the Standby Reserve or the Retired Reserve, or shall be discharged, as applicable.

(c) Ready Reserve members who occupy key positions shall be transferred to the Standby Reserve or the Retired Reserve, or shall be discharged, as appropriate.

(d) After a mobilization is ordered, no deferment, delay, or exemption from mobilization will be granted to Ready Reserve members because of their civilian employment.
