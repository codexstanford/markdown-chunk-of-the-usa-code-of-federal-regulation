####### § 22.215 Distinguishing grants and cooperative agreements.

(a) Once a grants officer judges, in accordance with §§ 22.205 and 22.210, that either a grant or cooperative agreement is the appropriate instrument, the grants officer shall distinguish between the two instruments as follows:

(1) Grants shall be used when the grants officer judges that substantial involvement is not expected between the Department of Defense and the recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.

(2) Cooperative agreements shall be used when the grants officer judges that substantial involvement is expected. The grants officer should document the nature of the substantial involvement that led to selection of a cooperative agreement. Under no circumstances are cooperative agreements to be used solely to obtain the stricter controls typical of a contract.

(b) In judging whether substantial involvement is expected, grants officers should recognize that "substantial involvement" is a relative, rather than an absolute, concept, and that it is primarily based on programmatic factors, rather than requirements for grant or cooperative agreement award or administration. For example, substantial involvement may include collaboration, participation, or intervention in the program or activity to be performed under the award.
