###### § 220.5 Records available.

Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1095(c), facilities of the uniformed services, when requested, shall make available to representatives of any third party payer from which the United States seeks payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095 for inspection and review appropriate health care records (or copies of such records) of individuals for whose care payment is sought. Appropriate records which will be made available are records which document that the services which are the subject of the claims for payment under 10 U.S.C. 1095 were provided as claimed and were provided in a manner consistent with permissible terms and conditions of the third party payer's plan. This is the sole purpose for which patient care records will be made available. Records not needed for this purpose will not be made available.
