####### § 720.21 Members or civilian employees subpoenaed as witnesses in State courts.

Where members or civilian employees are subpoenaed to appear as witnesses in State courts, and are served as described in §§ 720.20, 720.20(d) applies. If these persons are requested to appear as witnesses in State courts when the interests of the Federal Government are involved (e.g., Medical Care Recovery Act cases), follow the procedures described in § 720.22. If State authorities are attempting to obtain the presence of a member or a civilian employee as a witness in a civil or criminal case, and such person is unavailable because of an overseas assignment, the command should immediately contact the Judge Advocate General, or the Associate General Counsel (Litigation), as appropriate.
