The present Navy Combat Art Collection contains over 4,000 paintings and sketches. A significant number of new works is being added each year. The combat artists of World War II have been replaced by civilian artists who witness today's Navy in action, record their impressions, and donate their works of art to the Department of the Navy.

Organized in 1871, the Salmagundi Club is the oldest club of professional artists in the United States.

The Chief of Information reviews the nominations, and issues SECNAV invitational travel orders to each artist approved.
