###### Subpart K - Claims Under the National Guard Claims Act (32 U.S.C. 715)
####### § 842.98 Claims not payable.
######## i.e.,

(b) NGCA claims arising from noncombat activities in the U.S. are not covered by the FTCA because more elements are needed to state an FTCA claim than are needed to state a claim under the NGCA for noncombat activities. All FTCA claims are based on elements of traditional tort liability (duty, breach, causation, and damages); that is, they are fault based. Noncombat activity claims under the NGCA are based solely on causation and damages. Because NGCA claims for noncombat activities are not fault based, they are not covered by the FTCA.

(c) See subpart E of this part for other claims not payable.
