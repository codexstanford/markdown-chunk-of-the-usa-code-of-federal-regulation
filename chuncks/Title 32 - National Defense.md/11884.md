####### § 552.72 Use of the allotment of pay system.

(a) Allotments of military pay will be made in accordance with Army Regulation 37-104-3. Allotments will not be made to an insurer for the purchase of a commingled sale (e.g., retirement plans, securities).

(b) Under no circumstances will agents have allotment forms in their possession or attempt to assist or coordinate the administrative processing of such forms.

(c) For personnel in grades E-1, E-2, and E-3, at least 7 days should elapse between the signing of a life insurance application or contract and the certification of an allotment. The purchaser's commanding officer may grant a waiver of this requirement for good cause, such as the purchaser's imminent permanent change of station.
