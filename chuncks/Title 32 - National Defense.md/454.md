####### Cost Sharing
######## § 37.540 May I accept fully depreciated real property or equipment as cost sharing?

You should limit the value of any contribution of a fully depreciated asset to a reasonable use charge. In determining what is reasonable, you must consider:

(a) The original cost of the asset;

(b) Its estimated remaining useful life at the time of your negotiations;

(c) The effect of any increased maintenance charges or decreased performance due to age; and

(d) The amount of depreciation that the participant previously charged to Federal awards.
