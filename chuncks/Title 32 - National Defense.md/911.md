(b) The DoD shall engage in child-find activities for all children age birth to 21, inclusive, who are entitled by 20 U.S.C. 921-932 or 10 U.S.C. 2164 to enroll or are enrolled in a DoDEA school.

(c) Children with disabilities who meet the enrollment eligibility criteria of 20 U.S.C. 921-932 or 10 U.S.C. 2164 shall be provided a FAPE in the least restrictive environment, including if appropriate to the needs of the individual child, placement in a residential program for children with disabilities in accordance with the child's IEP and at no cost to the parents.

(d) The Military Departments and DoDEA shall cooperate in the delivery of related services prescribed by section 1401(26) of the IDEA and this part as may be required to assist eligible children with disabilities to benefit from special education.

(e) Children with disabilities who are eligible to enroll in a DoDEA school in accordance with 20 U.S.C. 921-932 or 10 U.S.C. 2164 shall not be entitled to provision of a FAPE by DoDEA, or to the procedural safeguards prescribed by this part in accordance with the IDEA, if:

(1) The sponsor is assigned to an overseas area where a DoDEA school is available within the commuting area of the sponsor's overseas assignment, but the sponsor does not elect to enroll the child in a DoDEA school for reasons other than DoDEA's alleged failure to provide a FAPE; or

(2) The sponsor is assigned in the United States or in a U.S. territory, commonwealth, or possession and the sponsor's child meets the eligibility requirements for enrollment in a DoDEA school, but the sponsor does not elect to enroll the child in a DoDEA school for reasons other than DoDEA's alleged failure to provide a FAPE.
