#### PART 1636 - CLASSIFICATION OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS
##### § 1636.5 Exclusion from Class 1-A-0 and Class 1-0.

A registrant shall be excluded from Class 1-A-0 or Class 1-0:

(a) Who asserts beliefs which are of a religious, moral or ethical nature, but who is found not to be sincere in his assertions; or

(b) Whose stated objection to participation in war does not rest at all upon moral, ethical, or religious principle, but instead rests solely upon considerations of policy, pragmatism, expediency, or his own self-interest or well-being; or

(c) Whose objection to participation in war is directed against a particular war rather than against war in any form (a selective objection). If a registrant objects to war in any form, but also believes in a theocratic, spiritual war between the forces of good and evil, he may not by reason of that belief alone be considered a selective conscientious objector.
