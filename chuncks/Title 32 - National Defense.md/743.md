##### PART 50 - PERSONAL COMMERCIAL SOLICITATION ON DOD INSTALLATIONS
###### General Provisions
####### § 50.4 Policy.

(a) It is DoD policy to safeguard and promote the welfare of DoD personnel as consumers by setting forth a uniform approach to the conduct of all personal commercial solicitation and sales to them by dealers and their agents. For those individuals and their companies that fail to follow this policy, the opportunity to solicit on military installations may be limited or denied as appropriate.

(b) Command authority includes authority to approve or prohibit all commercial solicitation covered by this part. Nothing in this part limits an installation commander's inherent authority to deny access to vendors or to establish time and place restrictions on commercial activities at the installation.
