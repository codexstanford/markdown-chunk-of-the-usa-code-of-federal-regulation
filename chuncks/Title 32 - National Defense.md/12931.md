####### § 720.11 Interviewing servicemembers or civilian employees by Federal civilian investigative agencies.

Requests by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Naval Investigative Service Command, or other Federal civilian investigative agencies to interview members or civilian employees of the Department of the Navy suspected or accused of crimes should be promptly honored. Any refusal of such a request shall be immediately reported to the Judge Advocate General, or the Office of General Counsel, as appropriate, by telephone, or by message if telephone is impractical. When the employee in question is a member of an exclusive bargaining unit, a staff judge advocate or General Counsel attorney will be consulted to determine whether the employee has a right to have a bargaining unit representative present during the interview.
