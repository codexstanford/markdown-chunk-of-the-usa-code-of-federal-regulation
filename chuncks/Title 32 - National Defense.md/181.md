(a) The potential recipient meets the standards in § 22.415 and is qualified to receive the grant or cooperative agreement; or

(b) An award is justified to a recipient that does not fully meet the standards, pursuant to § 22.405(b). In such cases, grants officers shall document in the award file the rationale for making an award to a recipient that does not fully meet the standards.
