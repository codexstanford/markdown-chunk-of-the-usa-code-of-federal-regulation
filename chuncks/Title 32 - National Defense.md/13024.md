###### Subpart A - Definitions
####### § 724.107 Discharge.

In the context of the review function prescribed by 10 U.S.C. 1553, a discharge or dismissal is a complete separation from the Naval Service, other than one pursuant to the sentence of a general court-martial. By reason of usage, the term "discharge" is predominantly applicable to the separation of enlisted personnel for any reason, and the term "dismissal" to the separation of officers as a result of Secretarial or general court-martial action. In the context of the mission of the NDRB, the term "discharge" used here shall, for purpose of ease of expression, include any complete separation from the naval service other than that pursuant to the sentence of general court-martial. The term "discharge" also includes the type of discharge and the reason/basis for that discharge, e.g., Other Than Honorable/Misconduct (Civil Conviction).
