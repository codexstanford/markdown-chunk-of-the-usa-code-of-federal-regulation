####### § 37.200 What are my responsibilities as an agreements officer for ensuring the appropriate use of TIAs?

You must ensure that you use TIAs only in appropriate situations. To do so, you must conclude that the use of a TIA is justified based on:

(a) The nature of the project, as discussed in § 37.205;

(b) The type of recipient, addressed in § 37.210;

(c) The recipient's commitment and cost sharing, as described in § 37.215;

(d) The degree of involvement of the Government program official, as discussed in § 37.220; and

(e) Your judgment that the use of a TIA could benefit defense research objectives in ways that likely would not happen if another type of assistance instrument were used. Your answers to the four questions in § 37.225 should be the basis for your judgment.
