(b) The Secretaries of the Military Departments are hereby authorized to exercise the power and authority conferred by section 506 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1758) to enter into agreements with claimants in full settlement and compromise of any claim against the United States thereunder, subject to such rules and regulations, if any, as the Secretary of Defense may promulgate from time to time.
