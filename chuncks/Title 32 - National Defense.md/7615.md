(a) Section 1128A(e) of the Social Security Act authorizes judicial review of a penalty and an assessment that has become final. The only matters subject to judicial review are those that the respondent raised pursuant to § 200.2021, unless the court finds that extraordinary circumstances existed that prevented the respondent from raising the issue in the underlying administrative appeal.

(b) A respondent must exhaust all administrative appeal procedures established by the Secretary or required by law before a respondent may bring an action in Federal court, as provided in section 1128A(e) of the Social Security Act, concerning any penalty and assessment imposed pursuant to this part.

(c) Administrative remedies are exhausted when a decision becomes final in accordance with § 200.2021(j).
