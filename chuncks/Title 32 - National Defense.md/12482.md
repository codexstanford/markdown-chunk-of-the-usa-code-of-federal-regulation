Marines performing such duties may come to the aid of civilian police in order to prevent the commission of a felony or injury to a civilian police officer.

(f) Procedures for absentee and deserter collection units to accept an active-duty absentee or deserter from civilian authorities may be established.

(g) Civilian police and civil court liaison may be established.
