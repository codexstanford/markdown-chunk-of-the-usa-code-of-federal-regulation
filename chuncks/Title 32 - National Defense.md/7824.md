##### PART 213 - SUPPORT FOR NON-FEDERAL ENTITIES AUTHORIZED TO OPERATE ON DOD INSTALLATIONS
###### § 213.4 Policy.

It is DoD policy that:

(a) DoD support for non-Federal entities shall be in accordance with relevant statutes as well as DoD 5500.7-R. In accordance with DoD 5500.7-R and to avoid preferential treatment, DoD support should be uniform, recognizing that non-Federal entity support of Service members and their families can be important to their welfare.

(b) Under DoD Directive 5124.8 procedures shall be established as Instructions and agreements for the operation of non-Federal entities on DoD installations and for the prohibition of official sanction, endorsement, or support by the DoD Components and officials, except as authorized by DoD 5500.7-R and applicable law. Instructions and agreements must be compatible with the primary mission of the Department and provide for Congressionally authorized support to non-Federal entities on DoD installations.

(c) In accordance with DoD 5500.7-R, installation commanders or higher authority may authorize, in writing, logistical support for events, including fundraising events, sponsored by non-Federal entities covered by this part.

(d) Installation commanders or higher authority may coordinate with non-Federal entities in order to support appropriated or nonappropriated fund activities on DoD installations, so long as the support provided by the non-Federal entities does not compete with appropriated or nonappropriated fund activities.

(e) Non-Federal entities are not entitled to sovereign immunity and the privileges given to Federal entities and instrumentalities.
