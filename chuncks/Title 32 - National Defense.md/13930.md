####### § 776.42 Candor and obligations toward the tribunal.

(a) A covered attorney shall not knowingly:

(1) Make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the covered attorney;

(2) Fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the covered attorney to be directly adverse to the position of the client and not disclosed by opposing counsel;

(3) Offer evidence that the covered attorney knows to be false. If a covered attorney, the attorney's client, or a witness called by the covered attorney, has offered material evidence and the covered attorney comes to know of its falsity, the covered attorney shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal. A covered attorney may refuse to offer evidence, other than the testimony of an accused in a criminal matter, that the covered attorney reasonably believes is false; or

(4) Disobey an order imposed by a tribunal unless done openly before the tribunal in a good faith assertion that no valid order should exist.

(b) A covered attorney who represents a client in an adjudicative proceeding and who knows that a person intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent conduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, disclosure to the tribunal.

(c) The duties stated in paragraph (a) of this section continue to the conclusion of the proceedings, and apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by § 776.25 of this part.

(d) In an ex parte proceeding, a covered attorney shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the covered attorney that will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse.

(e) [Reserved]
