######## see

The ultimate goal for using TIAs, like other assistance instruments used in defense research programs, is to foster the best technologies for future defense needs. TIAs differ from and complement other assistance instruments available to agreements officers, in that TIAs address the goal by fostering civil-military integration (appendix A to this part). TIAs therefore are designed to:

(a) Reduce barriers to commercial firms' participation in defense research, to give the Department of Defense (DoD) access to the broadest possible technology and industrial base.

(b) Promote new relationships among performers in both the defense and commercial sectors of that technology and industrial base.

(c) Stimulate performers to develop, use, and disseminate improved practices.
