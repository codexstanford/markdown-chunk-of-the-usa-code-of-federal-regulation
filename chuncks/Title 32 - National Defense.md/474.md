######## § 37.635 What cost principles do I require a nonprofit participant to use?

So as not to force financial system changes for any nonprofit participant, your expenditure-based TIA will provide that costs to be charged to the research project by any nonprofit participant must be determined to be allowable in accordance with:

(a) Subpart E of OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200, if the participant is a State, local government, Indian tribe, institution of higher education, or nonprofit organization. In conformance with 2 CFR 200.401(c) of that OMB guidance, a nonprofit organization listed in appendix VIII to 2 CFR part 200 is subject to the cost principles in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR subpart 31.2) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (48 CFR subpart 231.2).

(b) The cost principles identified in appendix IX to the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200 (see 45 CFR part 75), if the participant is a hospital.
