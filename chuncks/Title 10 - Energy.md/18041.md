(j) Disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceedings;

(k) Disclosure would compromise constitutional rights;

(l) Disclosure would result in DNFSB appearing to favor one litigant over another;

(m) Disclosure relates to documents that were produced by another agency;

(n) A substantial Government interest is implicated;
