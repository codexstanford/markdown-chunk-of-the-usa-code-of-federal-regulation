### PART 1008 - RECORDS MAINTAINED ON INDIVIDUALS (PRIVACY ACT)
#### Subpart A - General Provisions
##### § 1008.4 Procedures for identifying the individual making a request for access to or amendment of records.

(a) When a request for information about or for access to or correction of a record pertaining to an individual and contained in a system of records has been made pursuant to § 1008.6, valid identification of the individual making the request shall be required before information will be given, access granted or a correction considered, to insure that information is given, corrected, or records disclosed or corrected only at the request of the proper person.

(b) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, an individual making a request may establish his identity by:

(1) Including with his request, if submitted by mail, a photocopy of two identifying documents bearing his name and signature, one of which shall bear his current home or business address and date of birth; or

(2) Appearing at the appropriate DOE location during the regular business hours and presenting either of the following:

(i) One identifying document bearing the individual's photograph and signature, such as a driver's license or passport; or

(ii) Two identifying documents bearing the individual's name and signature, one of which shall bear the individual's current home or business address and date of birth; or

(3) Providing such other proof of identity as the Privacy Act Officer deems satisfactory in the circumstances of a particular request.

(c) If the Privacy Act Officer or the appropriate System Manager determines that the information in a record is so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual whose record in involved, or if the individual making the request is unable to produce satisfactory evidence of identity under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, the individual making the request may be required to submit a notarized statement attesting to his identity and his understanding of the criminal penalties provided under section 1001 of title 18 of the United States Code for making false statements to a Government agency and under subsection (i)(3) of the Act for obtaining records under false pretenses. Copies of these statutory provisions and forms of such notarized statements may be obtained upon request from the Privacy Act Officer, Headquarters, Department of Energy, Washington, DC.

(d) When an individual acting as the parent of a minor or the legal guardian of the person to whom a record pertains makes a request pursuant to § 1008.6 of this part:

(1) Such an individual shall establish his personal identity in the same manner required in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

(2) In addition, such an individual shall establish his identity in the representative capacity of parent or legal guardian. In the case of the parent of a minor, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the minor's birth certificate. In the case of the legal guardian of a person who has been declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the order from a court of competent jurisdiction.

(3) A parent or legal guardian may act only for a living individual, not for a decedent. Requests for the records of decedents will be handled under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552).
