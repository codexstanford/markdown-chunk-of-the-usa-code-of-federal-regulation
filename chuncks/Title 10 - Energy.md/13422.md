####### § 600.161 Termination.

(a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph (a) (1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

(1) By DOE, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.

(2) By DOE with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.

(3) By the recipient upon sending to DOE written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if DOE determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, it may terminate the award in its entirety under either paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section.

(b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 600.171(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.
