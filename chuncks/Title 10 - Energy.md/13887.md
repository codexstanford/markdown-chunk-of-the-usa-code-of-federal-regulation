(4) Describe update cycles or conditions and rules for adding or deleting information; and

(c) Recipients agree to comply with designated DOE records and data management requirements, including providing electronic data in prescribed formats and retention of specified records and data for eventual transfer to the Comprehensive Epidemiologic Data Resource or to another repository, as directed by DOE. Recipients will provide, as part of the final report, a description of records and data compiled during the project along with a plan for its preservation or disposition.

(d) Recipients agree to make project records and data available as soon as possible when requested by DOE.
