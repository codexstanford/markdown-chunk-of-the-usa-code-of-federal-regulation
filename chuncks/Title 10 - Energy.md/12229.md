###### § 436.20 Net savings.

For a retrofit project, net savings may be found by subtracting life cycle costs based on the proposed project from life cycle costs based on not having it. For a new building design, net savings is the difference between the life cycle costs of an alternative design and the life cycle costs of the basic design.
