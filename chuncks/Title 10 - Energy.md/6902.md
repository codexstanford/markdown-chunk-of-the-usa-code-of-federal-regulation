##### Application for Authorization to Transmit Electric Energy to a Foreign Country
###### § 205.308 Filing schedule and annual reports.

(a) Persons authorized to transmit electric energy from the United States shall promptly file all supplements, notices of succession in ownership or operation, notices of cancellation, and certificates of concurrence. In general, these documents should be filed at least 30 days prior to the effective date of any change.

(b) A change in the tariff arrangement does not require an amendment to the authorization. However, any entity with an authorization to export electric energy shall file with the ERA, and the appropriate state regulatory agency, a certified copy of any changed rate schedule and terms. Such changes may take effect upon the date of filing of informational data with the ERA.

(c) Persons receiving authorization to transmit electric energy from the United States shall submit to the ERA, by February 15 each year, a report covering each month of the preceding calendar year detailing the gross amount of kilowatt-hours of energy, by authorized category, received or delivered, and the cost and revenue associated with each category.
