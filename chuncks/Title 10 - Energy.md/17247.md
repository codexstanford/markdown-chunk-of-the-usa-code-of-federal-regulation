(b) An applicant or recipient may file an answer, and waive or fail to request a hearing, without waiving the requirement for findings of fact and conclusions of law or the right to seek review by the FERC in accordance with the provisions established by the FERC. At the time an answer is filed, the applicant or recipient may also submit written information or argument for the record if he/she does not request a hearing.

(2) Findings of fact and conclusions of law; and

(3) Seek review by the FERC.

(d) The failure of an applicant or recipient to file an answer within the period prescribed or, if the applicant or recipient requests a hearing, his failure to appear at the hearing shall constitute a waiver by him/her of a right to:

(1) A hearing under Section 902 of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 602 of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 16, Section 401, and § 1040.113;

(2) Conclusions of law; and

(3) Seek review by the FERC.

(e) An order entered in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section shall constitute the final decision of DOE unless the FERC, within forty-five (45) days after entry of the order, issues a subsequent decision which shall then constitute the final decision of DOE.

(f) A copy of an order entered by the FERC official shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.
