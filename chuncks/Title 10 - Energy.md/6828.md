###### § 205.84 DOE evaluation.
####### Processing.

(a)(1) The DOE may initiate an investigation of any statement in a request and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The DOE may accept submissions from third persons relevant to any request for interpretation provided that the person making the request is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating a request for interpretation, the DOE may consider any other source of information. The DOE on its own initiative may convene a conference, if, in its discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its evaluation of the request.

(2) The DOE shall issue its interpretation on the basis of the information provided in the request, unless that information is supplemented by other information brought to the attention of the General Counsel or a Regional Counsel during the proceeding. The interpretation shall, therefore, depend for its authority on the accuracy of the factual statement and may be relied upon only to the extent that the facts of the actual situation correspond to those upon which the interpretation was based.

(3) If the DOE determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional information is not submitted by the person requesting the interpretation, the DOE may refuse to issue an interpretation.
