DOE shall exercise leadership and take action to:

(2) Minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health, and welfare;

(3) Restore and preserve natural and beneficial values served by floodplains;

(4) Require the construction of DOE structures and facilities to be, at a minimum, in accordance with FEMA National Flood Insurance Program building standards;

(5) Promote public awareness of flood hazards by providing conspicuous delineations of past and probable flood heights on DOE property that has suffered flood damage or is in an identified floodplain and that is used by the general public;

(6) Inform parties during transactions guaranteed, approved, regulated, or insured by DOE of the hazards associated with locating facilities and structures in a floodplain;

(b) Undertake a careful evaluation of the potential effects of any proposed floodplain or wetland action.

(d) Identify, evaluate, and as appropriate, implement alternative actions that may avoid or mitigate adverse floodplain or wetland impacts.

(e) Provide opportunity for early public review of any plans or proposals for floodplain or wetland actions.
