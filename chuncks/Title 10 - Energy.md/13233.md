###### § 590.316 Shortened proceedings.

In any proceeding where, in response to a notice of application or notice of procedures, if applicable, no party files a motion requesting additional procedures, including the right to file written comments, or the holding of a conference, oral presentation, or trial-type hearing, or where the Assistant Secretary determines that such requested additional procedures are not required pursuant to §§ 590.310, 590.311, 590.312 and 590.313, the Assistant Secretary may issue a final opinion and order on the basis of the official record, including the application and all other filings. In any proceeding in which the Assistant Secretary intends to deny the application or grant the application with the attachment of material conditions unknown to, or likely to be opposed by, the applicant, solely on the basis of the application and responses to the notice of application or notice of procedures, if applicable, without additional procedures, the Assistant Secretary shall advise the parties in writing generally of the issues of concern to the Assistant Secretary upon which the denial or material conditions would be based and provide them with an opportunity to request additional procedures pursuant to §§ 590.310, 590.311, 590.312 and 590.313.
