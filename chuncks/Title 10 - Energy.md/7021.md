###### § 209.34 Maintenance of records.

(a) The Administrator or his delegate shall keep a verbatim transcript of any meeting held pursuant to this subpart except where (1) due to considerations of time or other overriding circumstances, the keeping of a verbatim transcript is not practicable, or (2) principal participants in the meeting are representatives of foreign governments. If any such record other than a verbatim transcript, is kept by a designee who is not a full-time Federal employee, that record shall be submitted to the full-time Federal employee in attendance at the meeting who shall review the record, promptly make any changes he deems necessary to make the record full and complete, and shall notify the designee of such changes.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) (2) through (4) of this section, participants shall keep a full and complete record of any communication (other than in a meeting held pursuant to this subpart) between or among themselves or with any other member of a petroleum industry group created by the International Energy Agency, or subgroup thereof for the purpose of carrying out a voluntary agreement or developing or carrying out a plan of action under this subpart, except that where there are several communications within the same day involving the same participants, they may keep a cumulative record for the day. The parties to a communication may agree among themselves who shall keep such record. Such record shall include the names of the parties to the communication and the organizations, if any, which they represent; the date of communication; the means of communication, and a description of the communication in sufficient detail to convey adequately its substance.

(2) Where any communication is written (including, but not limited to, telex, telegraphic, telecopied, microfilmed and computer printout material), and where such communication demonstrates on its face that the originator or some other source furnished a copy of the communication to the Office of International Affairs, Department of Energy with the notation "Voluntary Agreement" on the first page of the document, no participants need record such a communication or send a further copy to the Department of Energy. The Department of Energy may, upon written notice to participants, from time to time, or with reference to particular types of documents, require deposit with other offices or officials of the Department of Energy. Where such communication demonstrates that it was sent to the Office of International Affairs, Department of Energy with the notation "Voluntary Agreement" on the first page of the document, or such other offices or officials as the Department of Energy has designated pursuant to this section, it shall satisfy paragraph (c) of this section, for the purpose of deposit with the Department of Energy.

(3) To the extent that any communication is procedural, administrative or ministerial (for example, if it involves the location of a record, the place of a meeting, travel arrangements, or similar matters) only a brief notation of the date, time, persons involved and description of the communication need be recorded; except that during an IEA emergency allocation exercise or an allocation systems test such a non-substantive communication between members of the Industry Supply Advisory Group (ISAG) which occur within IEA headquarters need not be recorded.

(4) To the extent that any communication involves matters which recapitulate matters already contained in a full and complete record, the substance of such matters shall be identified, but need not be recorded in detail, provided that reference is made to the record and the portion thereof in which the substance is fully set out.

(c) Except where the Department of Energy otherwise provides, all records and transcripts prepared pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, shall be deposited within seven (7) days after the close of the week (ending Saturday) of their preparation during an international energy supply emergency or a test of the IEA emergency allocation system, and within fifteen (15) days after the close of the month of their preparation during periods of non-emergency, together with any agreement resulting therefrom, with the Department of Energy and shall be available to the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of State. Such records and transcripts shall be available for public inspection and copying to the extent set forth in subpart D. Any person depositing materials pursuant to this section shall indicate with particularity what portions, if any, the person believes are not subject to disclosure to the public pursuant to subpart D and the reasons for such belief.

(d) Any meeting between a participant and an official of DOE for the purpose of carrying out a voluntary agreement or developing or carrying out a plan of action shall, if not otherwise required to be recorded pursuant to this section, be recorded by such official as provided in § 204.5.

(e) During international oil allocation under chapters III and IV of the IEP or during an IEA allocation systems test, the Department of Energy may issue such additional guidelines amplifying the requirements of these regulations as the Department of Energy determines to be necessary and appropriate.
