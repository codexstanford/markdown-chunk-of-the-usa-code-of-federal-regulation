##### § 707.10 Drug testing for reasonable suspicion of illegal drug use.

(a)(1) It may be necessary to test any employee in a testing designated position, or individuals with unescorted access to the control areas of the DOE reactors listed in § 707.7(c), for the use of illegal drugs, if the behavior of such an individual creates the basis for reasonable suspicion of the use of illegal drugs. Two or more supervisory or management officials, at least one of whom is in the direct chain of supervision of the employee, or is a physician from the site occupational medical department, must agree that such testing is appropriate. Reasonable suspicion must be based on an articulable belief that an employee uses illegal drugs, drawn from particularized facts and reasonable inferences from those facts.

(2) Such a belief may be based upon, among other things:

(i) Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of:

(A) The use or possession of illegal drugs; or

(B) The physical symptoms of being under the influence of drugs;

(ii) A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior;

(iii) Arrest for a conviction of a drug related offense, or the identification of the individual as the focus of a criminal investigation into illegal drug possession use, or trafficking;

(iv) Information that is either provided by a reliable and credible source or is independently corroborated;

(v) Evidence that an employee has tampered with a drug test; or

(vi) Temperature of the urine specimen is outside the range of 32-38 degrees centigrade or 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit.

(b) The fact that an employee had a confirmed positive test for the use for the use of illegal drugs at some prior time, or has undergone a period of rehabilitation or treatment, will not, in and of itself, be grounds for testing on the basis of reasonable suspicion.

(c) The requirements of this part relating to the testing for the use of illegal drugs are not intended to prohibit the contractor from pursuing other existing disciplinary procedures or from requiring medical evaluation of any employee exhibiting aberrant or unusual behavior.
