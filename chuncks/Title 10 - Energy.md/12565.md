###### § 455.120 Grant applications for State administrative expenses.

Each State desiring to receive grants to help defray State administrative expenses shall file an application in accordance with the provisions of this section.

(a) Where a State is operating a program solely to provide grants to schools and hospitals, the maximum amount of administrative expenses the State may apply for is $50,000 or 5 percent of the Federal share of its schools and hospitals grant awards, whichever is greater.

(1) At any time after notice by DOE of the amounts allocated to each State for a grant program cycle, each State may apply to DOE for an amount for administrative expenses not exceeding $50,000.

(2) After making a submittal to DOE as required under § 455.133, each State may apply for a further grant not exceeding 5 percent of the total Federal share of all grant awards for technical assistance and energy conservation measures within the State, less the $50,000 provided for in paragraph (a)(l) of this section if that was previously awarded to the State for administrative expenses in the same grant program cycle.

(b) Where a State is eligible and elects to apply to use its appropriated allocation for grants for technical assistance, program assistance, and/or marketing pursuant to § 455.121, the maximum amount of administrative expenses the State may apply for is $50,000 or 5 percent of the total amount obligated or legally committed to eligible recipients in the State pursuant to the State's program under this part, whichever is greater.

(1) At any time after notice by DOE of amounts allocated to each State for a grant program cycle, each State may apply to DOE for an amount for administrative expenses not exceeding $50,000.

(2) Once the total amount obligated or legally committed to the program in the cycle is known, a State may subsequently apply for a further grant, not exceeding 5 percent of the total amount (less the $50,000 provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if that was previously awarded to the State for administrative expenses in the same fiscal year) obligated or legally committed to eligible recipients in the State during the fiscal year for technical assistance, program assistance, and marketing, and for energy conservation measures which are funded with non-Federal funds but which meet the certification and other requirements of this part for such energy conservation measures.

(3) The aggregate amount applied for to cover State administrative expenses, technical assistance, program assistance, and marketing cannot exceed the State's allocation for the fiscal year.

(c) In the event that a State cannot, or decides not to use the amount available to it for an administrative grant under this section for administrative purposes, these funds may, at the discretion of the State, be used for technical assistance and energy conservation measure grants to eligible institutions within that State in accordance with this part.

(d) Applications for financial assistance to defray State administrative expenses shall include:

(1) The name and address of the person designated by the State to be responsible for the State's functions under this part;

(2) An identification of intended use of all Federal and non-Federal funds to be used for the State administrative expenses listed in § 455.82; and

(3) Any other information required by DOE.
