## Chapter II - Department of Energy
### Subchapter D - Energy Conservation
#### PART 436 - FEDERAL ENERGY MANAGEMENT AND PLANNING PROGRAMS
##### Subpart B - Methods and Procedures for Energy Savings Performance Contracting
###### § 436.36 Conditions of payment.

(a) Any amount paid by a Federal agency pursuant to any energy savings performance contract entered into under this subpart may be paid only from funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the agency for the payment of energy expenses and related operation and maintenance expenses which would have been incurred without an energy savings performance contract. The amount the agency would have paid is equal to:

(1) The energy baseline under the energy savings performance contract (adjusted if appropriate under § 436.37), multiplied by the unit energy cost; and

(2) Any related operations and maintenance cost prior to implementation of energy conservation measures, adjusted for increases in labor and material price indices.

(b) Federal agencies may incur obligations pursuant to energy savings performance contracts to finance energy conservation measures provided guaranteed energy cost savings exceed the contractor's debt service requirements.
