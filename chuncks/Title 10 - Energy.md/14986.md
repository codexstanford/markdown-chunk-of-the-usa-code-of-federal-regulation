(b) This part applies to all inventions conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the course of or under any contract, grant, agreement, understanding, or other arrangement with or for the benefit of DOE (including any subcontract, subgrant, or subagreement), the patent rights disposition of which is governed by section 152 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, 42 U.S.C. 2182, or section 9 of the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974, 42 U.S.C. 5908.
