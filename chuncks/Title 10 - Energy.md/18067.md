(a) The Board will complete a final report of the safety investigation fully setting forth the Board's findings and conclusions.

(b) The final report of the safety investigation is confidential and protected by the safety privilege, and is therefore not releasable.

(c) The Board, in its discretion, may sanitize the final report of the safety investigation by redacting confidential and safety privileged information so that the report is put in a publically releasable format.

(d) Nothing in this section voids or otherwise displaces the Board's legal obligations with respect to compliance with the Freedom of Information Act, the Government in the Sunshine Act, or any procedures or requirements contained in the Board's regulations issued pursuant to those Acts.
