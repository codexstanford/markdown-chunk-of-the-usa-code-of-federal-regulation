##### § 850.31 Release criteria.

(a) The responsible employer must clean beryllium-contaminated equipment and other items to the lowest contamination level practicable, but not to exceed the levels established in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and label the equipment or other items, before releasing them to the general public or a DOE facility for non-beryllium use, or to another facility for work involving beryllium.

(b) Before releasing beryllium-contaminated equipment or other items to the general public or for use in a non-beryllium area of a DOE facility, the responsible employer must ensure that:

(1) The removable contamination level of equipment or item surfaces does not exceed the higher of 0.2 µg/100 cmor the concentration level of beryllium in soil at the point or release, whichever is greater;

(2) The equipment or item is labeled in accordance with § 850.38(b); and

(3) The release is conditioned on the recipient's commitment to implement controls that will prevent foreseeable beryllium exposure, considering the nature of the equipment or item and its future use and the nature of the beryllium contamination.

(c) Before releasing beryllium-contaminated equipment or other items to another facility performing work with beryllium, the responsible employer must ensure that:

(1) The removable contamination level of equipment or item surfaces does not exceed 3 µg/100 cm;

(2) The equipment or item is labeled in accordance with § 850.38(b); and

(3) The equipment or item is enclosed or placed in sealed, impermeable bags or containers to prevent the release of beryllium dust during handling and transportation.
