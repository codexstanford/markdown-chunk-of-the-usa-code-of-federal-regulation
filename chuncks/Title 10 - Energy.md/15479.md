#### § 840.4 Criterion I - Substantial discharge of radioactive material or substantial radiation levels offsite.

DOE will determine that there has been a substantial discharge or dispersal of radioactive material offsite, or that there have been substantial levels of radiation offsite, when as a result of an event comprised of one or more related happenings, radioactive material is released from its intended place of confinement or radiation levels occur offsite and either of the following findings are also made:

(a) DOE finds that one or more persons offsite were, could have been, or might be exposed to radiation or to radioactive material, resulting in a dose or in a projected dose in excess of one of the levels in the following table:

Exposures from the following types of sources of radiation shall be included:

(1) Radiation from sources external to the body;

(2) Radioactive material that may be taken into the body from its occurrence in air or water; and

(3) Radioactive material that may be taken into the body from its occurrence in food or on terrestrial surfaces.

(b) DOE finds that-

(1) Surface contamination of at least a total of any 100 square meters of offsite property has occurred as the result of a release of radioactive material from a production or utilization facility or device and such contamination is characterized by levels of radiation in excess of one of the values listed in column 1 or column 2 of the following table, or

(2) Surface contamination of any offsite property has occurred as the result of a release of radioactive material in the course of transportation and such contamination is characterized by levels of radiation in excess of one of the values listed in column 2 of the following table:
