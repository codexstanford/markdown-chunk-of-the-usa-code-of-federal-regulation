(2) If in the course of a proceeding conducted pursuant to subpart M or O, a subpoena is issued at the request of a person other than an officer or agency of the United States, the witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the person who requested the subpoena. However, at the request of the person, the witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the DOE if the person shows:

(i) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance the proceeding; and

(ii) The person who requested that the subpoena be issued would suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and mileage. The DOE Official issuing the subpoena shall make the determination required by this subsection.

(2) Any information furnished in response to an SRO shall be accompanied by the sworn certification under penalty of perjury of the person to whom it was directed or his authorized agent who actually provides the information that (i) a diligent effort has been made to provide all information required by the SRO, and (ii) all information furnished is true, complete, and correct unless withheld on grounds of privilege pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section.

(3) If any document responsive to a subpoena is not produced or any information required by an SRO is not furnished, the certification shall include a statement setting forth every reason for failing to comply with the subpoena or SRO.

However, the DOE official may deny the request for good cause. Upon proper identification, any witness or his attorney has the right to inspect the official transcript of the witness' own testimony.

(i) The DOE Official may sequester any person subpoenaed to furnish documents or give testimony. Unless permitted by the DOE Official, neither a witness nor his attorney shall be present during the examination of any other witnesses.

(j)(1) Any witness whose testimony is taken may be accompanied, represented and advised by his attorney as follows:

(k) The DOE Official shall take all necessary action to regulate the course of testimony and to avoid delay and prevent or restrain contemptuous or obstructionist conduct or contemptuous language. DOE may take actions as the circumstances may warrant in regard to any instances where any attorney refuses to comply with directions or provisions of this section.
