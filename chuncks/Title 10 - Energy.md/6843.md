Furthermore, the proponent of additional factual representations has the burden of going forward with the evidence.

(c) Unless otherwise specified by the Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals or his designee, the proponent of an order or a motion or additional factual representations has the ultimate burden of persuasion.
