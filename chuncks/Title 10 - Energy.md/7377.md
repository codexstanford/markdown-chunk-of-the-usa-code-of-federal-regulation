###### § 420.16 Extensions for compliance with required program activities.

An extension of time by which a required program activity must be ready for implementation may be granted if DOE determines that the extension is justified. A written request for an extension, with accompanying justification and an action plan acceptable to DOE for achieving compliance in the shortest reasonable time, shall be made to the cognizant Regional Office Director. Any extension shall be only for the shortest reasonable time that DOE determines necessary to achieve compliance. The action plan shall contain a schedule for full compliance and shall identify and make the most reasonable commitment possible to provision of the resources necessary for achieving the scheduled compliance.
