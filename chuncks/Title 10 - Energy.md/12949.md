###### § 501.2 Prepetition conference.

(a) Owners and operators of powerplants may request a prepetition conference with OFE for the purpose of discussing the applicability of 10 CFR parts 503 and 504 to their situations and the scope of any exemption or other petition that OFE would accept as adequate for filing purposes.

(b) The owner or operator who requests a prepetition conference may personally represent himself or may designate a representative to appear on his behalf. A prepetition conference or a request for a prepetition conference does not commence a proceeding before OFE.

(c) If OFE agrees to waive any filing requirements under § 501.3(d), a memorandum of record stating this fact will be furnished to the potential petitioner within thirty (30) days after the conference. Copies of all applicable memoranda of record must be attached to any subsequently-filed petition.

(d) A record of all prepetition conferences will be included in the public file. OFE may provide for the taking of a formal transcript of the conference and the transcript will be included in the public file.
