(3) Viewing and intercom systems in each high dose-rate, medium dose-rate, and pulsed dose-rate remote afterloader facility;

(4) Emergency response equipment;

(5) Radiation monitors used to indicate the source position;

(6) Timer accuracy;

(7) Clock (date and time) in the unit's computer; and

(8) Decayed source(s) activity in the unit's computer.

(e) If the results of the checks required in paragraph (d) of this section indicate the malfunction of any system, a licensee shall lock the control console in the off position and not use the unit except as may be necessary to repair, replace, or check the malfunctioning system.
