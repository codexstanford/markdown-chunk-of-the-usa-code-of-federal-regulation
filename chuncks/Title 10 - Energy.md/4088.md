### PART 52 - LICENSES, CERTIFICATIONS, AND APPROVALS FOR NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS
#### Subpart C - Combined Licenses
##### § 52.97 Issuance of combined licenses.

(a)(1) After conducting a hearing in accordance with § 52.85 and receiving the report submitted by the ACRS, the Commission may issue a combined license if the Commission finds that:

(i) The applicable standards and requirements of the Act and the Commission's regulations have been met;

(ii) Any required notifications to other agencies or bodies have been duly made;

(iii) There is reasonable assurance that the facility will be constructed and will operate in conformity with the license, the provisions of the Act, and the Commission's regulations.

(iv) The applicant is technically and financially qualified to engage in the activities authorized; and

(v) Issuance of the license will not be inimical to the common defense and security or to the health and safety of the public; and

(vi) The findings required by subpart A of part 51 of this chapter have been made.

(2) The Commission may also find, at the time it issues the combined license, that certain acceptance criteria in one or more of the inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria (ITAAC) in a referenced early site permit or standard design certification have been met. This finding will finally resolve that those acceptance criteria have been met, those acceptance criteria will be deemed to be excluded from the combined license, and findings under § 52.103(g) with respect to those acceptance criteria are unnecessary.

(b) The Commission shall identify within the combined license the inspections, tests, and analyses, including those applicable to emergency planning, that the licensee shall perform, and the acceptance criteria that, if met, are necessary and sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the facility has been constructed and will be operated in conformity with the license, the provisions of the Act, and the Commission's rules and regulations.

(c) A combined license shall contain the terms and conditions, including technical specifications, as the Commission deems necessary and appropriate.
