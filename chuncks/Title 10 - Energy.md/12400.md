(1) The cost of purchase and delivery of weatherization materials;

(3) Transportation of weatherization materials, tools, equipment, and work crews to a storage site and to the site of weatherization work;

(e) Not more than 10 percent of any grant made to a State may be used by the grantee and subgrantees for administrative purposes in carrying out duties under this part, except that not more than 5 percent may be used by the State for such purposes, and not less than 5 percent must be made available to subgrantees by States. A State may provide in its annual plan for recipients of grants of less than $350,000 to use up to an additional 5 percent of such grants for administration if the State has determined that such recipient requires such additional amount to implement effectively the administrative requirements established by DOE pursuant to this part.

(f) No grant funds awarded under this part shall be used for any of the following purposes:

(1) To weatherize a dwelling unit which is designated for acquisition or clearance by a Federal, State, or local program within 12 months from the date weatherization of the dwelling unit would be scheduled to be completed; or

(2) To install or otherwise provide weatherization materials for a dwelling unit weatherized previously with grant funds under this part, except:

(i) As provided under § 440.20;

(ii) If such dwelling unit has been damaged by fire, flood, or act of God and repair of the damage to weatherization materials is not paid for by insurance; or

(iii) That dwelling units partially weatherized under this part or under other Federal programs during the period September 30, 1975, through September 30, 1993, may receive further financial assistance for weatherization under this part. While DOE will continue to require these homes to be reported separately, States may count these homes as completions for the purposes of compliance with the per-home expenditure limit in § 440.18. Each dwelling unit must receive a new energy audit which takes into account any previous energy conservation improvements to the dwelling.
