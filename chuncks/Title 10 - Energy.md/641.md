(i) Deny a qualified disabled person the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;

(ii) Afford a qualified disabled person an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;

(iii) Provide a qualified disabled person with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;

(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to disabled persons or to any class of disabled persons than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified disabled persons with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;

(v) Deny a qualified disabled person the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or

(vi) Otherwise limit a qualified disabled person in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.

(2) The agency may not deny a qualified disabled person the opportunity to participate in programs or activities that are not separate or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or activities.

(3) The agency may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangments, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would-

(i) Subject qualified disabled persons to discrimination on the basis of disability; or

(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to disabled persons.

(4) The agency may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would-

However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the agency are not, themselves, covered by this part.

(c) The exclusion of nondisabled persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to disabled persons or the exclusion of a specific class of disabled persons from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of disabled persons is not prohibited by this part.

(d) The agency shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified disabled persons.
