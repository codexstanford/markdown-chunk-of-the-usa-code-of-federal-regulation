(a) For the purpose of defraying State expenses in the administration of special programs to provide technical assistance and program assistance pursuant to § 455.121, DOE may make a grant award to a State for up to 100 percent of the funds allocated to the State for the grant program cycle, provided that the State meets the requirements described in § 455.121(b). In addition:

(1) Funds for individual technical assistance programs provided by the State pursuant to this section shall not exceed 50 percent of the cost of the technical assistance program;

(2) Grants for program assistance may be made for up to 100 percent of a State's projected program assistance expenses; and

(3) Grants for State technical assistance, and program assistance programs may be awarded by DOE upon approval of an application from the State.

(b) For the purpose of defraying State expenses in the administration of a marketing program pursuant to § 455.121, DOE may make a grant award to a State for up to 50 percent of the funds allocated to the State for the grant program cycle, provided that the State meets the requirements described in § 455.121(b). In addition:

(1) Grants for marketing may be made for up to 100 percent of a State's projected marketing expenses; and

(2) Such grants may be awarded by DOE upon approval of an application from the State.

(c) If a State provides a certification under section 455.121(b) and is unable to document that the required non-Federal funding levels for energy conservation measures were achieved substantially for the previous fiscal year for which a similar certification was submitted, DOE may deny the application, accept it after the percentage of allocated funds is reduced in light of past performance, or take other appropriate action.

(d) In the event that a State, after receiving a grant under this section, cannot or decides not to use all or part of the amount available to it for technical assistance, program assistance, and marketing, these funds may, at the discretion of the State and after appropriate application to and approval of DOE, be used for technical assistance and energy conservation grants to eligible institutions within that State in accordance with this part.
