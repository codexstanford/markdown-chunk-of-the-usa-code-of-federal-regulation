###### § 209.33 Conduct of meetings.

(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, meetings held to carry out a voluntary agreement, or to develop or carry out a plan of action pursuant to this subpart, shall be open to all interested persons, subject to limitations of space. Interested persons desiring to attend meetings under this subpart may be required to advise the Administrator in advance.

(b) Interested persons permitted to attend meetings under this section may present data, views, and arguments orally and in writing, subject to such limitations with respect to the manner of presentation as the Administrator may impose.

(c) Meetings held pursuant to this subpart shall not be open to the public to the extent that the President or his delegate finds that disclosure of the proceedings beyond those authorized to attend would be detrimental to the foreign policy interests of the United States, and determines, in consultation with the Administrator, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, that a meeting shall not be open to interested persons or that attendance by interested persons shall be limited.

(d) The requirements of this section do not apply to meetings of bodies created by the International Energy Agency except that no participant in a voluntary agreement may attend any meeting of any such body held to carry out a voluntary agreement or to develop or to carry out a plan of action unless a full-time Federal employee is present.
