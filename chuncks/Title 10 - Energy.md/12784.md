###### § 490.204 Process for granting exemptions.

(a) To obtain an exemption, in whole or in part, from the vehicle acquisition mandate in section 490.201 of this part, a State shall submit to DOE a written request for exemption, along with supporting documentation which must demonstrate that-

(1) Alternative fuels that meet the normal requirements and practices of the principal business of the State fleet are not available from fueling sites that would permit central fueling of fleet vehicles in the area in which the vehicles are to be operated; or

(2) Alternative fueled vehicles that meet the normal requirements and practices of the principal business of the State fleet are not available for purchase or lease commercially on reasonable terms and conditions in the State; or

(3) The application of such requirements would pose an unreasonable financial hardship.

(b) Requests for exemption must be accompanied by supporting documentation, must be submitted no earlier than September 1 following the model year for which the exemption is sought and no later than January 31 following the model year for which the exemption is sought, and will only be considered following submission of the annual report under § 490.205.

(c) Exemptions are granted for one model year only, and they may be renewed annually, if supporting documentation is provided.

(d) Exemptions may be granted in whole or in part. When granting an exemption in part, DOE may, depending upon the circumstances, completely relieve a State from complying with a portion of the vehicle acquisition requirements for a model year, or it may require a State to acquire all or some of the exempted vehicles in future model years.

(e) If a State is seeking an exemption under-

(1) Paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the types of documentation that are to accompany the request must include, but are not limited to, maps of vehicle operation zones and maps of locations providing alternative fuel; or

(2) Paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the types of documentation that are to accompany the request must include, but are not limited to, alternative fueled vehicle purchase or lease requests, a listing of vehicles that meet the normal practices and requirements of the State fleet, and any other documentation that exhibits good faith efforts to acquire alternative fueled vehicles; or

(3) Paragraph (a)(3) of this section, it must submit a statement identifying what portion of the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition requirement should be subject to the exemption and describing the specific nature of the financial hardship that precludes compliance.

(f) Requests for exemption shall be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, EE-33, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585, or to such other address as DOE may announce in anotice.

(g) If DOE, in response to a request for exemption, seeks clarification or additional information from the State, such clarification or additional information must be submitted to DOE in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section within 30 days of DOE's inquiry. In the event a State does not comply with this timeframe, DOE will proceed under paragraph (h) of this section based on the documentation provided to date.

(h) The Assistant Secretary shall provide to the State, within 45 days of receipt of a request that complies with this section, a written determination as to whether the State's request has been granted or denied.

(i) If the Assistant Secretary denies an exemption, in whole or in part, and the State wishes to exhaust administrative remedies, the State must appeal within 30 days of the date of the determination, pursuant to 10 CFR part 1003, subpart C, to the Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20585. The Assistant Secretary's determination shall be stayed during the pendency of an appeal under this paragraph.
