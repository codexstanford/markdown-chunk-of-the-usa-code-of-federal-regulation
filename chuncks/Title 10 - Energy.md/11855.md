###### § 433.101 Performance level determination.

(a)(1) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after January 3, 2007, but before August 10, 2012, each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2004 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3), except the formula for calculating the Performance Rating in paragraph G1.2 shall read as follows:

(i) Percentage improvement = 100 x ((Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads)-(Proposed building consumption-Receptacle and process loads))/(Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads) (which simplifies as follows):

(ii) Percentage improvement = 100 x (Baseline building consumption-Proposed building consumption)/(Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads).

(2) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after August 10, 2012, but before July 9, 2014, each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2007 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3), except the formula for calculating the Performance Rating in paragraph G1.2 shall read as follows:

(i) Percentage improvement = 100 x ((Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads)-(Proposed building consumption-Receptacle and process loads))/(Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads) (which simplifies as follows):

(ii) Percentage improvement = 100 x (Baseline building consumption-Proposed building consumption)/(Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads).

(3) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after July 9, 2014, but before November 6, 2016 each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2010 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3), except the formula for calculating the Performance Rating in paragraph G1.2 shall read as follows:

(i) Percentage improvement = 100 x ((Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads)-(Proposed building consumption-Receptacle and process loads))/(Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads) (which simplifies as follows):

(ii) Percentage improvement = 100 x (Baseline building consumption-Proposed building consumption)/(Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads).

(4) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after November 6, 2016, but before April 7, 2023, each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2013 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2013 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3), except the formula for calculating the Performance Rating in Section G1.2 shall read as follows:

(i) Percentage improvement = 100 x ((Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads)-(Proposed building consumption-Receptacle and process loads))/(Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads) (which simplifies as follows):

(ii) Percentage improvement = 100 x (Baseline building consumption-Proposed building consumption)/(Baseline building consumption-Receptacle and process loads).

(5) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after April 7, 2023, each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2019 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2019 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3). The formula for determining the percentage improvement shall be as follows:

(b) Energy consumption for the purposes of calculating the 30 percent savings requirements shall include the building envelope and energy consuming systems normally specified as part of the building design by ASHRAE Standard 90.1 such as space heating, space cooling, ventilation, service water heating, and lighting, and all process and receptacle loads, except for energy-intensive process loads that are driven by mission and operational requirements, not necessarily buildings, and not influenced by conventional building energy conservation measures.
