#### PART 473 - AUTOMOTIVE PROPULSION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
##### Review and Certification of Grants, Cooperative Agreements, Contracts, and Projects
###### § 473.30 Standards and criteria.

Research and development to be performed under a grant, under a cooperative agreement, under a contract, as a DOE project, or as an agency project under the Act may be certified under these regulations only if the research and development to be conducted-

(a) Supplements the automotive propulsion system research and development efforts of industry or any other private researcher;

(b) Is not duplicative of efforts previously abandoned by private researchers unless there has been an intervening technological advance, promising conceptual innovation, or justified by other special consideration;

(c) Would not be performed during the annual funding period but for the availability of the Federal funding being sought;

(d) Is likely to produce an advanced automobile propulsion system suitable for steps toward technology transfer to mass production in a shorter time period than would otherwise occur;

(e) Is not technologically the same as efforts by any person conducted previously or to be conducted during the annual funding period regarding a substantially similar advanced automobile propulsion system; and

(f) Is not likely to result in a decrease in the level of private resources expended on advanced automotive research and development by substituting Federal funds without justification.
