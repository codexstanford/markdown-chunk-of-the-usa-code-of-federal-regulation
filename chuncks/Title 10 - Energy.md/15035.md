##### § 800.304 Default.

(a) In the event that the borrower fails to perform the terms and conditions of the loan, the borrower shall be in default and the Secretary shall have the right, at the Secretary's option, to accelerate the indebtedness and demand full payment of all principal and interest amounts outstanding under the loan.

(b) No failure on the part of the Secretary to make demand at any time shall constitute a waiver of the rights held by the Secretary.

(c) Upon demand by the Secretary, the borrower shall have a period of not more than 30 days from the date of receipt of the Secretary's demand to make payment in full.

(d) In the event that the failure on the part of the borrower to perform the terms and conditions of the loan does not constitute an intentional act, but is brought about as a result of circumstances largely beyond the control of the borrower, or is deemed by, the Secretary to be insubstantial, the Secretary may elect, at the Secretary's option, to defer such performance and/or restructure the repayment required by the loan agreement in any mutually acceptable manner.

(e) Should the borrower fail to pay after demand as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and no deferral or restructuring is agreed to by the Secretary as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary shall undertake collection in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and the applicable law.
