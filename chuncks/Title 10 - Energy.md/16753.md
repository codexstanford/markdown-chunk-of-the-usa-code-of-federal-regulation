For the purposes of this paragraph, a principal claim and any derivative or subrogated claim shall be treated as a single claim.

(2) A question of policy may be involved;

(3) The United States may be entitled to indemnity or contribution from a third party and the DOE is unable to adjust the third party claim; or

(4) The compromise of a particular claim, as a practical matter, may control the disposition of a related claim in which the amount to be paid may exceed $25,000.

(c) An administrative claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised, or settled only after consultation with the Department of Justice when the DOE is aware that the United States or an employee, agent, or cost-type contractor of the United States is involved in litagation based on a claim arising out of the same incident or transaction.

(d) The authority of DOE subordinate claims officials to make awards, compromises, and settlements of over $10,000 is subject to the approval of the General Counsel, the Deputy General Counsel, or the Deputy General Counsel for Legal Services.
