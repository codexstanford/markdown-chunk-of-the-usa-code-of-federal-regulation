###### § 2.625 Additional considerations.

(a) The Commission will not conduct more than one review of site suitability issues with regard to a particular site prior to filing and review of part two of the application described in § 2.101(a-1) of this part.

(b) The Commission, upon its own initiative, or upon the motion of any party to the proceeding filed at least 60 days prior to the date of the commencement of the evidentiary hearing on site suitability issues, may decline to initiate an early hearing or render an early partial decision on any issue or issues of site suitability:

(1) In cases where no partial decision on the relative merits of the proposed site and alternative sites under subpart A of part 51 is requested, upon determination that there is a reasonable likelihood that further review would identify one or more preferable alternative sites and the partial decision on one or more site suitability issues would lead to an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources prior to the submittal of the remainder of the information required by § 50.30(f) of this chapter that would prejudice the later review and decision on such alternative sites; or

(2) In cases where it appears that an early partial decision on any issue or issues of site suitability would not be in the public interest considering:

(i) The degree of likelihood that any early findings on those issues would retain their validity in later reviews;

(ii) The objections, if any, of cognizant State or local government agencies to the conduct of an early review on those issues; and

(iii) The possible effect on the public interest and the parties of having an early, if not necessarily conclusive, resolution of those issues.
