##### § 14.35 Limitation on NRC's authority.

(a) The NRC shall effect an award, compromise, or settlement of a claim hereunder in excess of $25,000 only with the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his designee. For the purposes of this paragraph, a principal claim and any derivative or subrogated claim are treated as a single claim.

(b) The NRC may adjust, determine, compromise, or settle a claim under this part only after consultation with the Department of Justice if, in the opinion of the Office of the General Counsel:

(1) A new precedent or a new point of law is involved;

(2) A question of policy is or may be involved;

(3) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or contribution from a third party and the NRC is unable to adjust the third party claim; or

(4) The compromise of a particular claim, as a practical matter, will or may control the disposition of a related claim in which the amount to be paid may exceed $25,000.

(c) The NRC may adjust, determine, compromise, or settle a claim under this part only after consultation with the Department of Justice if the NRC is informed or is otherwise aware that the United States, or an employee, agent, or cost-plus contractor of the United States, is involved in litigation based on a claim arising out of the same incident or transaction.

(d) When Department of Justice approval or consultation is required under this section or the advice of the Department of Justice is otherwise requested, the NRC shall direct the referral or request to the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, Department of Justice, in writing. The NRC shall ensure that the referral or request contains:

(1) A short and concise statement of the facts and the reasons for the referral or request;

(2) Copies of relevant portions of NRC's claim file; and

(3) A statement of the recommendations or views of the NRC.
