###### § 51.54 Environmental report - manufacturing license.

(a) Each applicant for a manufacturing license under subpart F of part 52 of this chapter shall submit with its application a separate document entitled, "Applicant's Environmental Report-Manufacturing License." The environmental report must address the costs and benefits of severe accident mitigation design alternatives, and the bases for not incorporating severe accident mitigation design alternatives into the design of the reactor to be manufactured. The environmental report need not address the environmental impacts associated with manufacturing the reactor under the manufacturing license, the benefits and impacts of utilizing the reactor in a nuclear power plant, or an evaluation of alternative energy sources.

(b) Each applicant for an amendment to a manufacturing license shall submit with its application a separate document entitled, "Applicant's Supplemental Environmental Report-Amendment to Manufacturing License." The environmental report must address whether the design change which is the subject of the proposed amendment either renders a severe accident mitigation design alternative previously rejected in an environmental assessment to become cost beneficial, or results in the identification of new severe accident mitigation design alternatives that may be reasonably incorporated into the design of the manufactured reactor. The environmental report need not address the environmental impacts associated with manufacturing the reactor under the manufacturing license.
