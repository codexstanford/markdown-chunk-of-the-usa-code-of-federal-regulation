###### § 60.136 Preclosure controlled area.

(a) A preclosure controlled area must be established for the geologic repository operations area.

(b) The geologic repository operations area shall be designed so that, for Category 2 design basis events, no individual located on or beyond any point on the boundary of the preclosure controlled area will receive the more limiting of a total effective dose equivalent of 0.05 Sv (5 rem), or the sum of the deep-dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue (other than the lens of the eye) of 0.5 Sv (50 rem). The eye dose equivalent shall not exceed 0.15 Sv (15 rem), and the shallow dose equivalent to skin shall not exceed 0.5 Sv (50 rem). The minimum distance from the surface facilities in the geologic repository operations area to the boundary of the preclosure controlled area must be at least 100 meters.

(c) The preclosure controlled area may be traversed by a highway, railroad, or waterway, so long as appropriate and effective arrangements are made to control traffic and to protect public health and safety.
