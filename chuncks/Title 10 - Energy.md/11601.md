###### § 431.385 Cessation of distribution of a basic model of an electric motor.

(a) In the event that a model of an electric motor is determined non-compliant by the Department in accordance with § 431.192 or if a manufacturer or private labeler determines a model of an electric motor to be in noncompliance, then the manufacturer or private labeler shall:

(1) Immediately cease distribution in commerce of the basic model.

(2) Give immediate written notification of the determination of noncompliance, to all persons to whom the manufacturer has distributed units of the basic model manufactured since the date of the last determination of compliance.

(3) Pursuant to a request made by the Secretary, provide the Department within 30 days of the request, records, reports, and other documentation pertaining to the acquisition, ordering, storage, shipment, or sale of a basic model determined to be in noncompliance.

(4) The manufacturer may modify the non-compliant basic model in such manner as to make it comply with the applicable performance standard. Such modified basic model shall then be treated as a new basic model and must be certified in accordance with the provisions of this subpart; except that in addition to satisfying all requirements of this subpart, the manufacturer shall also maintain records that demonstrate that modifications have been made to all units of the new basic model prior to distribution in commerce.

(b) If a basic model is not properly certified in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, the Secretary may seek, among other remedies, injunctive action to prohibit distribution in commerce of such basic model.
