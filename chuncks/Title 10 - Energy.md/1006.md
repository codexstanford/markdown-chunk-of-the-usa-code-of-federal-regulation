### PART 10 - CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR ACCESS TO RESTRICTED DATA OR NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION OR AN EMPLOYMENT CLEARANCE
#### Subpart C - Procedures
##### § 10.35 Reconsideration of cases.

(a) Where, pursuant to the procedures set forth in §§ 10.20 through 10.34, the Deputy Executive Director for Materials, Waste, Research, State, Tribal, Compliance, Administration, and Human Capital Programs or the Commission has made a determination granting an access authorization and/or an employment clearance to an individual, the individual's eligibility for an access authorization and/or an employment clearance will be reconsidered only when subsequent to the time of that determination, new derogatory information has been received or the scope or sensitivity of the Restricted Data or National Security Information to which the individual has or will have access has significantly increased. All new derogatory information, whether resulting from the NRC's reinvestigation program or other sources, will be evaluated relative to an individual's continued eligibility in accordance with the procedures of this part.

(b) Where, pursuant to these procedures, the Commission or Deputy Executive Director for Materials, Waste, Research, State, Tribal, Compliance, Administration, and Human Capital Programs has made a determination denying or revoking an access authorization and/or an employment clearance to an individual, the individual's eligibility for an access authorization and/or an employment clearance may be reconsidered when there is a bona fide offer of employment and/or a bona fide need for access to Restricted Data or National Security Information and either material and relevant new evidence is presented, which the individual and his or her representatives are without fault in failing to present before, or there is convincing evidence of reformation or rehabilitation. Requests for reconsideration must be submitted in writing to the Deputy Executive Director for Materials, Waste, Research, State, Tribal, Compliance, Administration, and Human Capital Programs through the Director, Office of Administration. Requests must be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth in detail the information referred to above. The Deputy Executive Director for Materials, Waste, Research, State, Tribal, Compliance, Administration, and Human Capital Programs shall cause the individual to be notified as to whether his or her eligibility for an access authorization and/or an employment clearance will be reconsidered and if so, the method by which a reconsideration will be accomplished.

(c) Where an access authorization and/or an employment clearance has been granted to an individual by the Director, Division of Facilities and Security, without recourse to the procedures set forth in §§ 10.20 through 10.34, the individual's eligibility for an access authorization and/or an employment clearance will be reconsidered only in a case where, subsequent to the granting of the access authorization and/or employment clearance, new derogatory information has been received or the scope or sensitivity of the Restricted Data or National Security Information to which the individual has or will have access has significantly increased. All new derogatory information, whether resulting from the NRC's reinvestigation program or other sources, will be evaluated relative to an individual's continued eligibility in accordance with the procedures of this part.
