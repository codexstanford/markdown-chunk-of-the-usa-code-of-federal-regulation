(2) If the applicant is an automobile manufacturer that did not manufacture in model year 2005, vehicles subject to the CAFE requirements, the applicant must demonstrate that the projected combined fuel economy for the relevant the advanced technology vehicle that is the subject of the application is greater than or equal to the industry adjusted average fuel economy for model year 2005 of equivalent vehicles, based on final CAFE compliance data.

(3) The CAFE values under this paragraph are to be calculated using the CAFE procedures applicable to the model year being evaluated.

(4) An applicant must provide fuel economy data, at the model level, relied upon to make the demonstration required by this section.

(5) An applicant that is a manufacturer of a qualifying component under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section does not need to make a showing of improved fuel economy under this paragraph.

(6) The applicant's liquidity as of the date of the loan application;

(7) Statements from applicant's lenders that the applicant is current with all payments due under loans made by those lenders at the time of the loan application; and

(8) Financial projections demonstrating the applicant's solvency through the period of time that the loan is outstanding.
