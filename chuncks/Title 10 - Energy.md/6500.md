(b) A participant may submit a written motion for the disqualification of any person presiding. The motion shall be supported by affidavit setting forth the alleged grounds for disqualification.

(c) If any presiding officer designated by the Commission deems himself disqualified, he shall withdraw by notice on the record after notifying the Commission.

(d) If a presiding officer becomes unavailable, the Commission will designate a replacement.

(e) Any motion concerning the designation of a replacement presiding officer shall be made within 5 days after the designation.

(f) Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the jurisdiction of a presiding officer other than the Commission commences as designated in the hearing notice and terminates upon certification of the hearing record to the Commission, or when the presiding officer is disqualified.
