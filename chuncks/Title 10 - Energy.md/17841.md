(2) The Board shall provide without charge, to all but commercial users.

(i) The first 100 pages of black and white duplication (or the cost equivalent); and

(ii) The first two hours of search by a clerical staff member (or the cost equivalent).

(3) When the total fee for a request will be $14.00 or less for any request, no fee shall be charged.
