(a) This part sets forth policies and procedures you must follow when you submit a demand or request to an employee of the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board (DNFSB) to produce official records and information, or provide testimony relating to official information, in connection with a legal proceeding.

(c) In providing for these requirements, DNFSB does not waive the sovereign immunity of the United States.

(d) This part provides guidance for the internal operations of DNFSB. It does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, that a party may rely upon in any legal proceeding against the United States.
