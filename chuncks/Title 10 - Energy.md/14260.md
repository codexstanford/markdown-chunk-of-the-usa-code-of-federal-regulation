### PART 706 - SECURITY POLICIES AND PRACTICES RELATING TO LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS
#### Security Policies and Procedures in National Labor Relations Board Proceedings
##### § 706.14 DOE's role in proceedings.

If controversies within the scope of the Labor Management Relations Act arise which cannot be adjusted by mutual agreement, and contested proceedings before NLRB result, each party to such proceedings will present his own position and the evidence in support thereof with due regard for existing security rules. DOE will be continuously informed of the progress of such proceedings and will act as may appear desirable (a) to assure the protection of classified information; (b) to assure that material and relevant information is not withheld from the record on grounds of security if such information can be supplied in unclassified form; and (c) to assist in determining appropriate action where a decision may turn on data which can be expressed only in classified form.
