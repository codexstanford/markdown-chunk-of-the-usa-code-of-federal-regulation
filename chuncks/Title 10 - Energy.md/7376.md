###### § 420.15 Minimum criteria for required program activities for plans.

A plan shall satisfy all of the following minimum criteria for required program activities.

(a) Mandatory lighting efficiency standards for public buildings shall:

(1) Be implemented throughout the State, except that the standards shall be adopted by the State as a model code for those local governments of the State for which the State's constitution reserves the exclusive authority to adopt and implement building standards within their jurisdictions;

(2) Apply to all public buildings (except for public buildings owned or leased by the United States), above a certain size, as determined by the State;

(3) For new public buildings, be no less stringent than the provisions of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989, and should be updated by enactment of, or support for the enactment into local codes or standards, which, at a minimum, are comparable to provisions of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989 which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552 (a) and 1 CFR part 51. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in § 420.6; and

(4) For existing public buildings, contain the elements deemed appropriate by the State.

(b) Program activities to promote the availability and use of carpools, vanpools, and public transportation shall:

(1) Have at least one of the following actions under implementation in at least one urbanized area with a population of 50,000 or more within the State or in the largest urbanized area within the State if that State does not have an urbanized area with a population of 50,000 or more:

(i) A carpool/vanpool matching and promotion campaign;

(ii) Park-and-ride lots;

(iii) Preferential traffic control for carpoolers and public transportation patrons;

(iv) Preferential parking for carpools and vanpools;

(v) Variable working schedules;

(vi) Improvement in transit level of service for public transportation;

(vii) Exemption of carpools and vanpools from regulated carrier status;

(viii) Parking taxes, parking fee regulations or surcharge on parking costs;

(ix) Full-cost parking fees for State and/or local government employees;

(x) Urban area traffic restrictions;

(xi) Geographical or time restrictions on automobile use; or

(xii) Area or facility tolls; and

(2) Be coordinated with the relevant Metropolitan Planning Organization, unless no Metropolitan Planning Organization exists in the urbanized area, and not be inconsistent with any applicable Federal requirements.

(c) Mandatory standards and policies affecting the procurement practices of the State and its political subdivisions to improve energy efficiency shall-

(1) With respect to all State procurement and with respect to procurement of political subdivisions to the extent determined feasible by the State, be under implementation; and

(2) Contain the elements deemed appropriate by the State to improve energy efficiency through the procurement practices of the State and its political subdivisions.

(d) Mandatory thermal efficiency standards for new and renovated buildings shall-

(1) Be implemented throughout the State, with respect to all buildings (other than buildings owned or leased by the United States, buildings whose peak design rate of energy usage for all purposes is less than one watt (3.4 Btu's per hour) per square foot of floor space for all purposes, or manufactured homes), except that the standards shall be adopted by the State as a model code for those local governments of the State for which the State's law reserves the exclusive authority to adopt and implement building standards within their jurisdictions;

(2) Take into account the exterior envelope physical characteristics, HVAC system selection and configuration, HVAC equipment performance and service water heating design and equipment selection;

(3) For all new commercial and multifamily high-rise buildings, be no less stringent than provisions of sections 7-12 of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989, and should be updated by enactment of, or support for the enactment into local codes or standards, which, at a minimum, are comparable to provisions of ASHRAE/IESNA 90.1-1989; and

(4) For all new single-family and multifamily low-rise residential buildings, be no less stringent than the Model Energy Code, 1993, and should be updated by enactment of, or support for the enactment into local codes or standards, which, at a minimum, are comparable to the Model Energy Code, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in § 420.6;

(5) For renovated buildings:

(i) Apply to those buildings determined by the State to be renovated buildings; and

(ii) Contain the elements deemed appropriate by the State regarding thermal efficiency standards for renovated buildings.

(e) A traffic law or regulation which permits the operator of a motor vehicle to make a turn at a red light after stopping shall:

(1) Be in a State's motor vehicle code and under implementation throughout all political subdivisions of the State;

(2) Permit the operator of a motor vehicle to make a right turn (left turn with respect to the Virgin Islands) at a red traffic light after stopping except where specifically prohibited by a traffic sign for reasons of safety or except where generally prohibited in an urban enclave for reasons of safety; and

(3) Permit the operator of a motor vehicle to make a left turn from a one-way street to a one-way street (right turn with respect to the Virgin Islands) at a red traffic light after stopping except where specifically prohibited by a traffic sign for reasons of safety or except where generally prohibited in an urban enclave for reasons of safety.

(f) Procedures must exist for ensuring effective coordination among various local, State, and Federal energy efficiency, renewable energy and alternative transportation fuel programs within the State, including any program administered within the Office of Building Technology, State and Community Programs of the Department of Energy and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.
