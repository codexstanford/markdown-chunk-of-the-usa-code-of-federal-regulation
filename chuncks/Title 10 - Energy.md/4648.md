### PART 62 - CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR EMERGENCY ACCESS TO NON-FEDERAL AND REGIONAL LOW-LEVEL WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES
#### Subpart B - Request for a Commission Determination
##### § 62.12 Contents of a request for emergency access: General information.

A request for a Commission determination under this part must include the following information for each generator to which the request applies:

(a) Name and address of the person making the request;

(b) Name and address of the person(s) or company(ies) generating the low-level radioactive waste for which the determination is sought;

(c) A statement indicating whether the generator is basing the request on the grounds of a serious and immediate threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and security;

(d) Certification that the radioactive waste for which emergency access is requested is low-level radioactive waste within § 62.1(c) of this part;

(e) The low-level waste generation facility(ies) producing the waste for which the request is being made;

(f) A description of the activity that generated the waste;

(g) Name of the disposal facility or facilities which had been receiving the waste stream of concern before the generator was denied access;

(h) A description of the low-level radioactive waste for which emergency access is requested, including-

(1) The characteristics and composition of the waste, including, but not limited to-

(i) Type of waste (e.g. solidified oil, scintillation fluid, failed equipment);

(ii) Principal chemical composition;

(iii) Physical state (solid, liquid, gas);

(iv) Type of solidification media; and

(v) Concentrations and percentages of any hazardous or toxic chemicals, chelating agents, or infectious or biological agents associated with the waste;

(2) The radiological characteristics of the waste such as-

(i) The classification of the waste in accordance with 61.55;

(ii) A list of the radionuclides present or potentially present in the waste, their concentration or contamination levels, and total quantity;

(iii) Distribution of the radionuclides within the waste (surface or volume distribution);

(iv) Amount of transuranics (nanocuries/gram);

(3) The minimum volume of the waste requiring emergency access to eliminate the threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and security;

(4) The time duration for which emergency access is requested (not to exceed 180 days);

(5) Type of disposal container or packaging (55 gallon drum, box, liner, etc.); and

(6) Description of the volume reduction and waste minimization techniques applied to the waste which assure that it is reduced to the maximum extent practicable, and the actual reduction in volume that occurred;

(i) Basis for requesting the determination set out in this part, including-

(1) The circumstances that led to the denial of access to existing low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities;

(2) A description of the situation that is responsible for creating the serious and immediate threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and security, including the date when the need for emergency access was identified;

(3) A chronology and description of the actions taken by the person requesting emergency access to prevent the need for making such a request, including consideration of all alternatives set forth in § 62.13 of this part, and any supporting documentation as appropriate;

(4) An explanation of the impacts of the waste on the public health and safety or the common defense and security if emergency access is not granted, and the basis for concluding that these impacts constitute a serious and immediate threat to the public health and safety or the common defense and security. The impacts to the public health and safety or the common defense and security should also be addressed if the generator's services, including research activities, were to be curtailed, either for a limited period of time or indefinitely;

(5) Other consequences if emergency access is not granted;

(j) Steps taken by the person requesting emergency access to correct the situation requiring emergency access and the person's plans to eliminate the need for additional or future emergency access requests;

(k) Documentation certifying that access has been denied;

(l) Documentation that the waste for which emergency access is requested could not otherwise qualify for disposal pursuant to the Unusual Volumes provision (Section 5(c)(5) of the Act) or is not simultaneously under consideration by the Department of Energy (DOE) for access through the Unusual Volumes allocation;

(m) Date by which access is required;

(n) Any other information which the Commission should consider in making its determination.
