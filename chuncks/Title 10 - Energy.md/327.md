(a) Each application for a standard design certification will be assigned a docket number. However, to allow a determination as to whether an application is complete and acceptable for docketing, it will be initially treated as a tendered application. A copy of the tendered application will be available for public inspection at the NRC Web site,and/or at the NRC Public Document Room. Generally, the determination on acceptability for docketing will be made within a period of 30 days. The Commission may decide to determine acceptability on the basis of the technical adequacy of the application as well as its completeness.

(b) If the Commission determines that a tendered application is complete and acceptable for docketing, a docket number will be assigned to the application or part thereof, and the applicant will be notified of the determination.
