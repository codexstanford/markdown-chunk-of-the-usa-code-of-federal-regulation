(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no license will be issued to export nuclear equipment or material, other than byproduct material, to any non-nuclear weapon state that is found by the President to have, after March 10, 1978:

(1) Detonated a nuclear explosive device;

(2) Terminated or abrogated IAEA safeguards;

(3) Materially violated an IAEA safeguards agreement; or

(4) Engaged in activities involving source or special nuclear material and having direct significance for the manufacture or acquisition of nuclear explosive devices, and failed to take steps which represent sufficient progress toward terminating such activities.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no license will be issued to export nuclear equipment or material, other than byproduct material, to any country or group of countries that is found by the President to have, after March 10, 1978:

(1) Materially violated an agreement for cooperation with the United States or the terms of any other agreement under which nuclear equipment or material has been exported;

(2) Assisted, encouraged or induced any non-nuclear weapon state to engage in activities involving source or special nuclear material and having direct significance for the manufacture or acquistion of nuclear explosive devices, and failed to take steps which represent sufficient progress toward terminating such assistance, encouragement or inducement; or

(3) Entered into an agreement for the transfer of reprocessing equipment, materials or technology to the sovereign control of a non-nuclear weapon state, except in connection with an international fuel cycle evaluation in which the United States is a participant or pursuant to an international agreement or understanding to which the United States subscribes.

(c) Under section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act, the President may waive the requirement for the termination of exports to a country described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section after determining in writing that the cessation of exports would seriously prejudice the achievement of United States nonproliferation objectives or otherwise jeopardize the common defense and security. If the President makes this determination, the Commission will issue licenses to export to that country, if other applicable statutory provisions are met.
