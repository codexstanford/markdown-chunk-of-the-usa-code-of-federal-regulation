###### § 205.190 Purpose and scope.

(a) This subpart establishes the procedures for determining the nature and extent of violations of the DOE regulations in parts 210, 211, and 212 and the procedures for issuance of a Notice of Probable Violation, a Proposed Remedial Order, a Remedial Order, an Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, a Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Order of Disallowance, an Order of Disallowance, or a Consent Order. Nothing in these regulations shall affect the authority of DOE enforcement officials in coordination with the Department of Justice to initiate appropriate civil or criminal enforcement actions in court at any time.

(b) When any report required by the ERA or any audit or investigation discloses, or the ERA otherwise discovers, that there is reason to believe a violation of any provision of this chapter, or any order issued thereunder, has occurred, is continuing or is about to occur, the ERA may conduct an inquiry to determine the nature and extent of the violation. A Remedial Order or Order of Disallowance may be issued thereafter by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The ERA may commence enforcement proceedings by serving a Notice of Probable Violation, a Notice of Probable Disallowance, a Proposed Remedial Order, a Proposed Order of Disallowance, or an Interim Remedial Order for Immediate Compliance.
