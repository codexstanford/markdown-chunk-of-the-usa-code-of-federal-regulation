#### PART 440 - WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE FOR LOW-INCOME PERSONS
##### § 440.11 Native Americans.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Support Office Director may determine, after taking into account the amount of funds made available to a State to carry out the purposes of this part, that:

(1) The low-income members of an Indian tribe are not receiving benefits under this part equivalent to the assistance provided to other low-income persons in the State under this part and

(2) The low-income members of such tribe would be better served by means of a grant made directly to provide such assistance.

(b) In any State for which the Support Office Director shall have made the determination referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, the Support Office Director shall reserve from the sums that would otherwise be allocated to the State under this part not less than 100 percent, or more than 150 percent, of an amount which bears the same ratio to the State's allocation for the fiscal year involved as the population of all low-income Native Americans for whom a determination under paragraph (a) of this section has been made bears to the population of all low-income persons in the State.

(c) The Support Office Director shall make the determination prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section in the event a State:

(1) Does not apply within the sixty-day time period prescribed in § 440.12(a);

(2) Recommends that direct grants be made for low-income members of an Indian tribe as provided in § 440.12(b)(5);

(3) Files an application which DOE determines, in accordance with the procedures in § 440.30, not to make adequate provision for the low-income members of an Indian tribe residing in the State; or

(4) Has received grant funds and DOE determines, in accordance with the procedures in § 440.30, that the State has failed to implement the procedures required by § 440.16(6).

(d) Any sums reserved by the Support Office Director pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall be granted to the tribal organization serving the individuals for whom the determination has been made, or where there is no tribal organization, to such other entity as the Support Office Director determines is able to provide adequate weatherization assistance pursuant to this part. Where the Support Office Director intends to make a grant to an organization to perform services benefiting more than one Indian tribe, the approval of each Indian tribe shall be a prerequisite for the issuance of a notice of grant award.

(e) Within 30 days after the Support Office Director has reserved funds pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Support Office Director shall give written notice to the tribal organization or other qualified entity of the amount of funds reserved and its eligibility to apply therefor.

(f) Such tribal organization or other qualified entity shall thereafter be treated as a unit of general purpose local government eligible to apply for funds hereunder, pursuant to the provisions of § 440.13.
