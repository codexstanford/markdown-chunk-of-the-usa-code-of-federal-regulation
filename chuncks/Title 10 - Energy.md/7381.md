###### § 420.30 Purpose and scope.

(a) This subpart sets forth DOE's policies and procedures for implementing special projects financial assistance under this part.

(b) For years in which such funding is available, States may apply for financial assistance to undertake a variety of State-oriented energy-related special projects activities in addition to the funds provided under the regular SEP grants.

(c) The types of funded activities may vary from year to year, and from State to State, depending upon funds available for each type of activity and DOE and State priorities.

(d) A number of end-use sector programs in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy participate in the funding of these activities, and the projects must meet the requirements of those programs.

(e) The purposes of the special project activities are:

(1) To utilize States to accelerate deployment of energy efficiency, renewable energy, and alternative transportation fuel technologies;

(2) To facilitate the commercialization of emerging and underutilized energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies; and

(3) To increase the responsiveness of Federally funded technology development efforts to the needs of the marketplace.
