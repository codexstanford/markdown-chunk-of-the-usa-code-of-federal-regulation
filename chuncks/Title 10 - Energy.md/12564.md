###### § 455.113 Grantee records and reports for technical assistance and energy conservation measure grants to institutions and coordinating agencies.

(a) Each unit of local government or public care institution which receives a grant for a technical assistance program and each school, hospital, and coordinating agency which receives a grant for a technical assistance program or an energy conservation measure, including renewable resource measures, shall keep all the records required by § 455.4 in accordance with this part and the DOE Financial Assistance Rules.

(b) Each grantee shall submit reports as follows:

(1) For technical assistance programs, two copies of a final report of the analysis completed on each building for which financial assistance was provided shall be submitted, either both to the State energy agency, or one to the State energy agency, and one to DOE as agreed upon between the State and the DOE Support Office no later than 90 days following completion of the analysis. These reports shall contain:

(i) The report submitted to the institution by the technical assistance analyst, and

(ii) The institution's plan to implement energy conservation maintenance and operating procedures;

(2) For energy conservation measure projects:

(i) Semi-annual progress reports. Two copies shall be submitted, either both to the State energy agency or one to the State energy agency and one to DOE, as agreed upon between the State and the DOE Support Office, no later than the end of July (for the period January 1 through June 30), and January (for the period July 1 through December 31) and shall detail and discuss milestones accomplished, those not accomplished, status of in-progress activities, and remedial actions if needed to achieve project objectives. Reports of coordinating agency grantees shall include financial assistance which an institution declines or does not use as a result of a change in scope. A final report may be submitted in lieu of the last semi-annual report if it satisfies the semi-annual progress report and final report designated time frames;

(ii) A final report. Two copies shall be submitted, either both to the State energy agency or one to the State energy agency and one to DOE, as agreed upon between the State and the DOE Support Office, within 90 days of the completion of the project and shall list and describe the energy conservation measures acquired and installed, contain a final actual cost and a final estimated simple payback period for each measure and the project as a whole, or a final savings-to-investment ratio for each measure and the project as a whole (depending on the State requirement), and include a statement that the completed energy conservation measures conform to the approved grant application;

(iii) Annual energy use reports from a representative sample to be selected by the State which will reflect the grantee's actual post-retrofit energy use experiences for 3 years after project completion. Two copies of these reports shall be submitted, either both to the State energy agency or one to the State energy agency and one to DOE, as agreed upon between the State and the DOE Support Office within 60 days after the end of each 12-month period covered in the reports and shall identify each building and provide data on energy use for that building for the relevant 12-month period. To the extent feasible, energy consumption data in each annual report should be the monthly usage data by fuel or energy type, and the reports should include brief descriptions of any changes in building usage, equipment, or structure occurring during the reporting period.

(3) Each copy of any technical assistance or energy conservation measure report shall be accompanied by a financial status report completed in accordance with the documents listed in § 455.3;

(4) In cases where both copies of the grantee technical assistance, energy conservation measure, and financial status reports are submitted to the State, as agreed upon between the State and the DOE Support Office, the State shall in turn submit copies to DOE on a mutually agreed-upon schedule; and

(5) Such other information as DOE may from time to time request.
