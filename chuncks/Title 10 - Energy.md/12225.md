###### § 436.16 Establishing non-fuel and non-water cost categories.

(a) The relevant non-fuel cost categories are-

(1) Investment costs;

(2) Non-fuel operation and maintenance cost;

(3) Replacement cost; and

(4) Salvage value.

(b) The relevant non-water cost categories are-

(1) Investment costs;

(2) Non-water operation and maintenance cost;

(3) Replacement cost; and

(4) Salvage value.

(c) The present value of recurring costs is the product of the base year value of recurring costs as multiplied by the appropriate uniform present worth factor under § 436.14, or as calculated by computer software indicated in § 436.18(b) and used with the official discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under § 436.14. When recurring costs begin to accrue at a later time, subtract the present value of recurring costs over the delay, calculated using the appropriate uniform present worth factor for the period of the delay, from the present value of recurring costs over the study period or, if using computer software, indicate a delayed beneficial occupancy date.

(d) The present value of non-recurring cost under § 436.16(a) is the product of the non-recurring costs as multiplied by appropriate single present worth factors under § 436.14 for the respective years in which the costs are expected to be incurred, or as calculated by computer software provided or approved by DOE and used with the official discount rate and escalation rate assumptions under § 436.14.
