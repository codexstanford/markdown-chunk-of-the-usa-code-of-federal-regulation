If the Secretary determines that a basic model of any covered equipment does not comply with an applicable energy conservation standard:

(a) The Secretary will notify the manufacturer, private labeler, or any other person as required, of this finding and of the Secretary's intent to seek a judicial order restraining further distribution in commerce of units of such a basic model unless the manufacturer, private labeler or other person as required, delivers, within 15 calendar days, a satisfactory statement to the Secretary, of the steps the manufacturer, private labeler or other person will take to insure that the noncompliant basic model will no longer be distributed in commerce. The Secretary will monitor the implementation of such statement.

(b) If the manufacturer, private labeler or any other person as required, fails to stop distribution of the noncompliant basic model, the Secretary may seek to restrain such violation in accordance with sections 334 and 345 of the Act.

(c) The Secretary will determine whether the facts of the case warrant the assessment of civil penalties for knowing violations in accordance with sections 333 and 345 of the Act.
