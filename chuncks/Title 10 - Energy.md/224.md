###### § 2.604 Notice of hearing on application for early review of site suitability issues in construction permit proceeding.

(a) Where an applicant for a construction permit requests an early review and hearing and an early partial decision on issues of site suitability pursuant to § 2.101(a-1), the provisions in the notice of hearing setting forth the matters of fact and law to be considered, as required by § 2.104, shall be modified so as to relate only to the site suitability issue or issues under review.

(b) After docketing of part two of the application, as provided in §§ 2.101(a-1) and 2.603, a supplementary notice of hearing will be published under § 2.104 with respect to the remaining unresolved issues in the proceeding within the scope of § 2.104. This supplementary notice of hearing will provide that any person whose interest may be affected by the proceeding and who desires to participate as a party in the resolution of the remaining issues shall file a petition for leave to intervene pursuant to § 2.309 within the time prescribed in the notice. This supplementary notice will also provide appropriate opportunities for participation by a representative of an interested State under § 2.315(c) and for limited appearances under § 2.315(a).

(c) Any person who was permitted to intervene as a party under the initial notice of hearing on site suitability issues and who was not dismissed or did not withdraw as a party may continue to participate as a party to the proceeding with respect to the remaining unresolved issues, provided that within the time prescribed for filing of petitions for leave to intervene in the supplementary notice of hearing, he or she files a notice of his intent to continue as a party, along with a supporting affidavit identifying the specific aspect or aspects of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which he or she wishes to continue to participate as a party and setting forth with particularity the basis for his contentions with regard to each aspect or aspects. A party who files a non-timely notice of intent to continue as a party may be dismissed from the proceeding, absent a determination that the party has made a substantial showing of good cause for failure to file on time, and with particular reference to the factors specified in §§ 2.309(c)(1)(i) through (iv) and 2.309(d). The notice will be ruled upon by the Commission or presiding officer designated to rule on petitions for leave to intervene.

(d) To the maximum extent practicable, the membership of any atomic safety and licensing board designated to preside in the proceeding on the remaining unresolved issues pursuant to the supplemental notice of hearing will be the same as the membership designated to preside in the initial notice of hearing on site suitability issues.
