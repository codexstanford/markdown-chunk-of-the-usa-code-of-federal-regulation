### PART 11 - CRITERIA AND PROCEDURES FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR ACCESS TO OR CONTROL OVER SPECIAL NUCLEAR MATERIAL
#### Criteria for Determining Eligibility for Access to, or Control Over, Special Nuclear Material
##### § 11.21 Application of the criteria.

(a) The decision to grant or deny special nuclear material access authorization is a comprehensive, common-sense judgment, made after consideration of all the relevant information, favorable or unfavorable, that to grant or deny special nuclear material access authorization is or is not inimical to the common defense and security and is or is not clearly consistent with the national interest.

(b) To assist in making these determinations, on the basis of all the information in a particular case, there are set forth in § 10.11 of this chapter a number of specific types of derogatory information. These criteria are not exhaustive but contain the principal types of derogatory information which in the opinion of the Commission create a question as to the individual's eligibility for special nuclear material access authorization. These criteria are subject to continuing review and may be revised from time to time as experience and circumstances may make desirable.

(c) When the reports of an investigation of an individual contain information reasonably falling within one or more of the classes of derogatory information listed in § 10.11, it creates a question as to the individual's eligibility for special nuclear material access authorization. In these cases, the application of the criteria must be made in light of and with specific regard to whether the existence of the information supports a reasonable belief that the granting of a special nuclear material access authorization would be inimical to the common defense and security. The Director, Division of Facilities and Security, may authorize the granting of a special nuclear material access authorization on the basis of the information in the case or may authorize the conduct of an interview with the individual and, on the basis of the interview and other investigation as the Director deems appropriate, may authorize the granting of a special nuclear material access authorization. Otherwise, a question concerning the eligibility of an individual for a special nuclear material access authorization must be resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in §§ 10.20 through 10.38 of this chapter.

(d) In resolving a question concerning the eligibility or continued eligibility of an individual for a special nuclear material access authorization by action of the Hearing Examiner or a Personnel Security Review Panel,the following principle shall be applied by the Examiner and the Personnel Security Review Panel: Where there are sufficient grounds to establish a reasonable belief as to the truth of the information regarded as substantially derogatory and when the existence of this information supports a reasonable belief that granting access would be inimical to the common defense and security, this will be the basis for a recommendation for denying or revoking special nuclear material access authorization if not satisfactorily rebutted by the individual or shown to be mitigated by circumstance.
