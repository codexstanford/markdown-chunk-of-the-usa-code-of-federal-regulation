###### § 429.7 Confidentiality.

(a) The following records are not exempt from public disclosure: Product or equipment type; product or equipment class; private labeler name; brand name; applicable model number(s) unless that information meets the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section; energy or water ratings submitted by manufacturers to DOE pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13); whether the certification was based on a test procedure waiver and the date of such waiver; and whether the certification was based on exception relief from the Office of Hearing and Appeals and the date of such relief.

(b) An individual, manufacturer model number is public information unless:

(1) The individual, manufacturer model number is a unique model number of a commercial packaged boiler, commercial water heating equipment, commercial HVAC equipment or commercial refrigeration equipment that was developed for an individual customer,

(2) The individual, manufacturer model number is not displayed on product literature, and

(3) Disclosure of the individual, manufacturer model number would reveal confidential business information as described at § 1004.11 of this title-in which case, under these limited circumstances, a manufacturer may identify the individual manufacturer model number as a private model number on a certification report submitted pursuant to § 429.12(b)(6).

(c) Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11(e), any person submitting information or data which the person believes to be confidential and exempt by law from public disclosure should-at the time of submission-submit:

(1) One complete copy, and one copy from which the information believed to be confidential has been deleted.

(2) A request for confidentiality containing the submitter's views on the reasons for withholding the information from disclosure, including:

(i) A description of the items sought to be withheld from public disclosure,

(ii) Whether and why such items are customarily treated as confidential within the industry,

(iii) Whether the information is generally known by or available from other sources,

(iv) Whether the information has previously been made available to others without obligation concerning its confidentiality,

(v) An explanation of the competitive injury to the submitting person which would result from public disclosure,

(vi) A date upon which such information might lose its confidential nature due to the passage of time, and

(vii) Why disclosure of the information would be contrary to the public interest.

(d) In accordance with the procedures established in 10 CFR 1004.11(e), DOE shall make its own determination with regard to any claim that information submitted be exempt from public disclosure.
