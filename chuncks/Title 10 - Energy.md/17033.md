##### § 1021.340 Classified, confidential, and otherwise exempt information.

(a) Notwithstanding other sections of this part, DOE shall not disclose classified, confidential, or other information that DOE otherwise would not disclose pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552) and 10 CFR 1004.10(b) of DOE's regulations implementing the FOIA, except as provided by 40 CFR 1506.6(f).

(b) To the fullest extent possible, DOE shall segregate any information that is exempt from disclosure requirements into an appendix to allow public review of the remainder of a NEPA document.

(c) If exempt information cannot be segregated, or if segregation would leave essentially meaningless material, DOE shall withhold the entire NEPA document from the public; however, DOE shall prepare the NEPA document, in accordance with the CEQ Regulations and this part, and use it in DOE decisionmaking.
