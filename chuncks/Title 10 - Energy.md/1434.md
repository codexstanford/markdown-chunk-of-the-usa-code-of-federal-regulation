### PART 20 - STANDARDS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST RADIATION
#### Subpart H - Respiratory Protection and Controls To Restrict Internal Exposure in Restricted Areas
##### § 20.1702 Use of other controls.

(a) When it is not practical to apply process or other engineering controls to control the concentrations of radioactive material in the air to values below those that define an airborne radioactivity area, the licensee shall, consistent with maintaining the total effective dose equivalent ALARA, increase monitoring and limit intakes by one or more of the following means-

(1) Control of access;

(2) Limitation of exposure times;

(3) Use of respiratory protection equipment; or

(4) Other controls.

(b) If the licensee performs an ALARA analysis to determine whether or not respirators should be used, the licensee may consider safety factors other than radiological factors. The licensee should also consider the impact of respirator use on workers' industrial health and safety.
