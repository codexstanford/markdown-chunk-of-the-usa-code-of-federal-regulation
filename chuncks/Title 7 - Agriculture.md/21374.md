With respect to the 1988 crop year, a husband and wife shall be considered to be one person except that such individuals who, prior to their marriage, were separately engaged in unrelated farming operations will be determined to be separate persons with respect to such farming operations so long as the operations remain separate and distinct from any farming operation conducted by the other spouse if such individuals have executed a Contract to Participate in the 1988 Price Support and Production Adjustment Programs by April 15, 1988. Such individuals must file a form FSA-561 with the county committee for each such farming operation by July 8, 1988, if they desire to be considered as separate persons under this section.
