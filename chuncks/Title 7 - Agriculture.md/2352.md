### PART 15c - NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AGE IN PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES RECEIVING FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
#### § 15c.10 Exhaustion of administrative remedies.

(a) A complainant may file a civil action, in a United States district court for the district in which the recipient is found or transacts business, following the exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are exhausted if:

(1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and the agency has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or

(2) The agency issues any finding in favor of the recipient.

(b) Before commencing the action, the complainant shall give 30 days' notice by registered mail to the Secretary of HHS, the Attorney General of the United States, the head of the granting USDA agency, and the recipient stating the alleged violation of the Age Act, the relief requested, the court in which the action will be brought, and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails.

(c) No action shall be brought if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States. A complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that these costs must be demanded in the complaint.
