All provisions of this subpart applicable to Qualified State Soybean Boards will be applicable to such entity. The Board shall review such applications for certification and shall make a determination as to the certification of each applicant.

(2) Submit to the Board a report describing the manner in which assessments are collected and the procedure utilized to ensure that assessments due are paid;

(3) Certify to the Board that such State entity will collect assessments paid on soybeans marketed within the State and establish procedures for ensuring compliance with this subpart with regard to the payment of such assessments;

(4) Certify to the Board that such organization will remit to the Board each assessment paid and remitted to it, minus credits issued pursuant to § 1220.222(c) and authorized credits issued to producers pursuant to § 1220.223(a)(3), and other required deductions by the last day of the month following the month in which the assessment was remitted to it unless the Board determines a different date for remittance of assessments;

(7) Certify to the Board that it will furnish the Board with an annual report by a certified public accountant or an authorized State agency of all funds remitted to such Board pursuant to this subpart; and

(8) Not use funds it collects pursuant to this subpart to fund plans or projects which make use of any unfair or deceptive acts or practices with respect to the quality, value or use of any product that competes with soybeans or soybean products; and

(9)(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this section, funds collected or received by the Qualified State Soybean Board under this subpart shall not be used in any manner for the purpose of influencing any action or policy of the United States Government, any foreign or State government, or any political subdivision thereof.

(B) Any action designed to market soybeans or soybean products directly to a foreign government or political subdivision thereof; or

(C) The development and recommendation of amendments to this subpart.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, and provided that activities of a Qualified State Soybean Board are authorized under the Act and this subpart, the Board shall not have the authority to:

(1) Establish guidelines, regulations, or rules which would restrict or infringe upon a Qualified State Soybean Board's authority to determine administrative or program expenditure allocations or administrative or program implementation; and

(2) Direct Qualified State Soybean Boards to participate or not participate in program activities or implementation.

(d) The Board shall establish procedures, after an opportunity for public comment and subject to approval of the Secretary, which provide Qualified State Soybean Boards with a right to present information to the Board prior to any determinations relating to nonparticipation as a Qualified State Soybean Board following initial election or determination as a Qualified State Soybean Board.

(e) Entities authorized or required to pay refunds to producers must certify to the Board that any requests from producers for such refunds for contributions to it by the producer will be honored by forwarding to the Board that portion of such refunds equal to the amount of credit received by the producer for contributions pursuant to § 1220.223(a)(3). Entities not authorized by State statute but organized and operating within a State and certified by the Board pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section must provide producers an opportunity for a State refund and must forward that refunded portion to the Board.
