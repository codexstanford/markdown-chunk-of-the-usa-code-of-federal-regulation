##### Subpart F - Discounted Prepayments on RUS Electric Loans
###### § 1786.155 Eligible borrower.

(a) To be eligible to prepay an electric loan under this subpart, the borrower must be in compliance with the following:

(1) The borrower shall be current on all payment obligations on outstanding loans made or guaranteed by RUS. For the purpose of determining eligibility for prepayment, a default by a power supply borrower from which a distribution borrower purchases wholesale power shall not be considered a default by the distribution borrower;

(2) There shall exist no material defaults under the borrower's RUS Loan Contract and Mortgage;

(3) The borrower shall have expended all funds advanced pursuant to the RUS Loan Contract for the purposes for which such funds were advanced. A borrower will not be eligible to prepay under this subpart if it has any funds advanced pursuant to the RUS Loan Contract in its Construction Fund Account; and

(4) The borrower shall be current on all obligations under any wholesale power contract with an RUS financed power supply borrower.

(b) The eligibility of borrowers that have had any indebtedness representing loans made or guaranteed by RUS restructured shall be determined on a case by case basis considering the terms and conditions of the restructuring agreement.
