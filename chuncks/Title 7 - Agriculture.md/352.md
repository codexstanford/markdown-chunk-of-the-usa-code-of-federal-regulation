###### § 1.220 The Department's considerations in deciding whether to grant or deny a demand.

(a) In deciding whether to grant or deny a demand, the appropriate Department official should consider the following factors:

(1) Whether compliance with the demand would be unduly burdensome, disproportionate to the needs of the case, or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or rules of procedure governing the legal proceeding underlying the demand;

(2) Whether compliance with the demand is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege or disclosure of information;

(3) The public interest;

(4) The need to conserve the time and expense of Department employees for the conduct of official business;

(5) The need to avoid spending the time and money of the United States for non-Federal government purposes;

(6) The need to maintain impartiality between private litigants in cases in which a substantial Department interest is not implicated;

(7) Whether compliance with the demand would have an adverse effect on the Department's mission and duties;

(8) The need to avoid involving the Department in issues not related to its mission; and

(9) Any other factor the Department determines to be relevant to the interests of the Department.

(b) A demand will not be granted if the disclosure of official information or employee testimony relating to official information:

(1) Would violate a statute or a rule of procedure;

(2) Would violate a regulation or executive order;

(3) Would reveal information properly classified in the interest of national security;

(4) Would reveal confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets in the absence of the owner's consent;

(5) Would reveal the internal deliberative processes of the Executive Branch or other privileged information; or

(6) Would potentially impede or prejudice an on-going law enforcement investigation.
