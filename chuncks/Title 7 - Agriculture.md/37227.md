###### § 1780.81 Policies related to use of bond counsel.

The applicant is responsible for preparation of bonds and bond transcript documents. The applicant will obtain the services and opinion of recognized bond counsel experienced in municipal financing with respect to the validity of a bond issue, except for issues of $100,000 or less. With prior approval of the approval official, the applicant may elect not to use bond counsel. Such issues will be closed in accordance with the following:

(a) The applicant must recognize and accept the fact that application processing may require additional legal and administrative time;

(b) It must be established that not using bond counsel will produce significant savings in total legal costs;

(c) The local attorney must be able and experienced in handling this type of legal work;

(d) The applicant must understand that it will likely have to obtain an opinion from bond counsel at its expense should the Agency require refinancing of the debt;

(e) Bonds will be prepared in accordance with this regulation and conform as closely as possible to the preferred methods of preparation stated in § 1780.94; and

(f) Closing instructions must be issued by OGC.
