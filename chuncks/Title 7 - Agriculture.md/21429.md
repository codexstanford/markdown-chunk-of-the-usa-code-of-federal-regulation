(a) FSA will determine the appropriate scoping process for the environmental review of a proposed action based on the nature, complexity, potential significance of effects, and level of controversy of the proposed action.

(b) As part of its scoping process, FSA will:

(1) Invite appropriate Federal, State, and Tribal governments, and other interested parties to participate in the process, if determined necessary by FSA;

(2) Identify the significant issues to be analyzed;

(3) Identify and eliminate from further review issues that were determined not significant or have been adequately addressed in any prior environmental reviews;

(4) Determine the roles of lead and cooperating agencies, if appropriate;

(5) Identify any related EAs or EISs;

(6) Identify other environmental reviews and consultation requirements, including NHPA requirements and State, local, regional, and Tribal requirements, so they are integrated into the NEPA process;

(7) Identify the relationship between the timing of the environmental review process and FSA's decision making process;

(8) Determine points of contact within FSA; and

(9) Establish time limits for the environmental review process.

(c) FSA may hold public meetings as part of the scoping process, if appropriate and as time permits. The process that FSA will use to determine if a public scoping meeting is needed, and how such meetings will be announced, is specified in § 799.17.
