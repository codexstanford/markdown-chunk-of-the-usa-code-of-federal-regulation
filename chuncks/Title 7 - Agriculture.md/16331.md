###### § 319.75 Restrictions on importation of regulated articles; disposal of articles refused importation.
####### Trogoderma granarium

(a) The Secretary has determined that in order to prevent the entry into the United States of khapra beetle (Everts) it is necessary to restrict the importation of certain articles from foreign countries and localities. Accordingly, no person shall import any regulated article unless in conformity with all of the applicable restrictions in this subpart.

(b) Any article refused importation for noncompliance with the requirements of this subpart shall be promptly removed from the United States or abandoned by the importer, and pending such action shall be subject to the immediate application of such safeguards against escape of plant pests as the inspector determines necessary to prevent the introduction into the United States of plant pests. If the article is not promptly safeguarded, removed from the United States, or abandoned by the importer for destruction, it may be seized, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of in accordance with section 414 of the Plant Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 7714).

(c) A regulated article may be imported without complying with other restrictions under this subpart if:

(1) Imported for experimental, therapeutic, or developmental purposes under the conditions specified in a controlled import permit issued in accordance with § 319.6;

(2) Imported at the National Plant Germplasm Inspection Station, Building 580, Beltsville Agricultural Research Center East, Beltsville, MD 20705, or through any USDA plant inspection station listed in § 319.37-8(a); and

(3) Imported with a controlled import tag or label securely attached to the outside of the container containing the article or securely attached to the article itself if not in a container, and with such tag or label bearing a controlled import permit number corresponding to the number of the controlled import permit issued for such article.
