####### § 301.52-4 Issuance and cancellation of certificates and permits.

(a) Certificates may be issued for any regulated articles by any inspector if he determines that they are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles and:

(1) Have originated in noninfested premises in a regulated area and have not been exposed to infestation while within the regulated areas; or

(2) Upon examination, have been found to be free of infestation; or

(3) Have been treated to destroy infestation in accordance with part 305 of this chapter; or

(4) Have been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby.

(b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow interstate movement of regulated articles, not eligible for certification under this subpart, to specified destinations for limited handling, utilization, or processing, or for treatment in accordance with part 305 of this chapter, when upon evaluation of the circumstances involved in each specific case the inspector determines that such movement will not result in the spread of the pink bollworm and requirements of other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met.

(c) Restricted destination permits may be issued by an inspector to allow the interstate movement of regulated articles to any destination permitted under all applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines (for other than scientific purposes) if such articles are not eligible for certification under all such quarantines but would otherwise qualify for certification under this subpart.

(d) Scientific permits may be issued by the Deputy Administrator to allow the interstate movement of regulated articles for scientific purposes under such conditions as may be prescribed in each specific case by the Deputy Administrator.

(e) Certificate, limited permit, and restricted destination permit forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use by the latter for subsequent shipments provided such person is operating under a compliance agreement; and any such person may be authorized by an inspector to reproduce such forms on shipping containers or otherwise. Any such person may use the certificate forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement if such person has made one of the determination specified in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to such articles. Any such person may use the limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for interstate movement of regulated articles to specific destinations authorized by the inspector in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Any such person may use the restricted destination permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles not eligible for certification under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such articles, under the conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by the inspector if the inspector determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such document imposed by this subpart.
