####### § 1450.213 Levels and rates for establishment payments.

(a) CCC will pay not more than 50 percent of the actual or average cost (whichever is lower) of establishing non-woody perennial crops and woody perennial crops specified in the conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan, not to exceed $500 per acre. For socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers, as defined in part 718 of this title, establishment payments may not exceed $750 per acre.

(b) The average cost of performing a practice will be determined by CCC based on recommendations from the State Technical Committee. Such cost may be the average cost in a State, a county, or a part of a State or county, as determined by CCC. The average cost as determined by CCC will be used for payment purposes, if it is less than the actual cost for an individual participant.

(c) Except as otherwise provided for in this part, a participant may receive, in addition to any payment under this part, establishment assistance, rental payments, or tax benefits from a State or a private organization in return for enrolling lands in BCAP without a commensurate reduction in BCAP establishment payments.
