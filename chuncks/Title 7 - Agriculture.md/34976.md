The Agency will notify the Applicant of the loan or loan/grant combination offer in writing, and the date by which the Applicant must accept the offer. If the Applicant accepts the terms of the offer, a loan or loan/grant combination contract, note, security agreement, and any other necessary documents will be executed by the Agency and sent to the Applicant. The Applicant must execute the Award documents and satisfy all conditions precedent to closing within the timeframe specified by the Agency. If the conditions are not met within this timeframe, the loan or loan/grant combination offer may be terminated, unless the Applicant requests and the Agency approves, an extension. The Agency may approve such a request if the Applicant has diligently sought to meet the conditions required for closing and has been unable to do so for reasons outside its control.
