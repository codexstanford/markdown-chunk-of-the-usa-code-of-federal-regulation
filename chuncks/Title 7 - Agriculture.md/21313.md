###### Subpart C - Placement of Rated Orders
####### § 789.12 Elements of a rated order.

(a) Each rated order must include:

(1) The appropriate priority rating (for example, DO-P1 for food and food resources processing and storage);

(2) A required delivery date or dates. The words "immediately" or "as soon as possible" do not constitute a delivery date. Some purchase orders, such as a "requirements contract," "basic ordering agreement," "prime vendor contract," or similar procurement document, bearing a priority rating may contain no specific delivery date or dates if it provides for the furnishing of items or services from time-to-time or within a stated period against specific purchase orders, such as calls, requisitions, and delivery orders. Specific purchase orders must specify a required delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original procurement document;

(3) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order, of an individual authorized to sign rated orders for the person placing the order. The signature or use of the name certifies that the rated order is authorized under this part and that the requirements of this part are being followed; and

(4) A statement as follows:

(i) A statement that reads:

(ii) If the rated order is placed in support of emergency preparedness requirements and expedited action is necessary and appropriate to meet these requirements, the following sentences should be added following the statement specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section:

(b) [Reserved]
