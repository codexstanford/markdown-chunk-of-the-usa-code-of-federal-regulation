The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. The Deputy Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in witing, stating the reasons for such decision, as promptly as circmstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of Practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Deputy Administrator.
