(a) The agent or loss adjuster shall provide his or her correct SSN to FCIC or the insurance provider, whichever is applicable, to be eligible to participate in the crop insurance program. The SSN will be used by FCIC and the insurance provider in establishing a database for the purposes of:

(1) Identifying agents and loss adjusters on an individual basis;

(2) Evaluating agents and loss adjusters to determine level of performance;

(3) Determining eligibility for program participation; and

(4) Collection of any amount which may be owed by the agent and loss adjuster to the United States.

(b) If the loss adjuster contracting with FCIC to participate in the crop insurance program does not provide his or her correct SSN on forms or contracts where such SSN is required, the loss adjuster's contract will be cancelled effective on the date of refusal and the loss adjuster will be subject to suspension and debarment in accordance with the suspension and debarment regulations of the United States Department of Agriculture.

(c) If the agent or loss adjuster contracting with an insurance provider, who is also a private insurance company, to participate in the crop insurance program does not provide his or her correct SSN on forms or contracts where such SSN is required, the premium subsidy payable for administrative and operating expenses under the Standard Reinsurance Agreement, or any other reinsurance agreement, will not be paid on those policies lacking the correct SSN.
