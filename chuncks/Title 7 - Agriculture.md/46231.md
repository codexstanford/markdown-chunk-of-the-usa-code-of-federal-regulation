###### § 4280.50 Disbursement of Zero-Interest Loan funds.

(a) For a REDL loan, Rural Development will disburse Zero-Interest Loan funds to the Intermediary in accordance with the terms of the executed loan agreement. All loan funds will be disbursed either as an advance to the Intermediary, in multiple advances, or as a reimbursement for eligible project costs, once the Intermediary has complied with Rural Development requirements.

(b) The Intermediary must provide to the Ultimate Recipient all loan funds that the Intermediary receives from Rural Development within one year of receiving them. If the Intermediary does not re-lend Rural Development funds within one year, the loan funds, and all interest earned on the loan funds, must be returned to the Agency.

(c) For a REDG loan, Rural Development will disburse Grant funds to the Intermediary in accordance with 2 CFR 200 as adopted by USDA in 2 CFR part 400 as applicable. Specifically, Rural Development will disburse the Grant funds in advance if the following requirements are met:

(1) The Intermediary has established written procedures that will minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from Rural Development and their disbursement to the Ultimate Recipient;

(2) The management system of the Intermediary meets the requirements of 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA in 2 CFR part 400, as applicable;

(3) All necessary supplemental funds for the Project have been obligated or committed to the Revolving Loan Fund; and

(4) The requests for cash advances made by the Intermediary are limited to the minimum amounts needed and timed to be in accordance with the actual immediate cash needs of the Ultimate Recipient for carrying out the Project.
