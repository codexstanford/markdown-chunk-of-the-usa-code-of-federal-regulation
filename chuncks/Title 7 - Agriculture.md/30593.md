##### PART 1429 - ASPARAGUS REVENUE MARKET LOSS ASSISTANCE PAYMENT PROGRAM
###### § 1429.107 Maximum and final payment rates.

(a) Subject to the funding limits that may apply to the program, the estimated maximum per pound payment rates for fresh market asparagus and for processed market asparagus are:

(1) $1.06 per pound ($106.00 per hundredweight) for 2003 crop quantities of asparagus marketed to fresh markets; and

(2) $1.08 per pound ($108.00 per hundredweight) for 2003 crop quantities of asparagus marketed for processing.

(b) This program will be administered to assure that total payments do not exceed the available funding. If the total value of payments claimed calculated using the maximum payment rates specified in paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the funding available for each marketing category, less any reserve that may be created as specified in § 1429.109, the payment quantities will be paid at a lower rate determined by dividing the funds available in each marketing category of asparagus, by the payment quantity from applications received by the end of the application period in each marketing category.

(c) In no event will the payment rate exceed the maximum payment rate for each marketing category of asparagus determined in paragraph (a) of this section.
