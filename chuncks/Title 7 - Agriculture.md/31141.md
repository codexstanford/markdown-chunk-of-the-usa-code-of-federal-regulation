###### Subpart A - Common Provisions
####### § 1450.3 General.

(a) The objectives of BCAP are to:

(1) Support the establishment and production of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy and biobased products in selected project areas; and

(2) Assist agricultural and forest landowners and operators with matching payments to support the collection, harvest, storage, and transportation costs of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility.

(b) A participant must implement and adhere to a conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan prepared in accordance with BCAP guidelines, as established and determined by CCC. A conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan for contract acreage must be implemented by a participant and must be approved by the conservation district in which the lands are located, or, in the case of Federal lands, the appropriate approval authority of jurisdiction. If the conservation district declines to review the conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan, the provider of technical assistance may take such further action as is needed to account for lack of such review.

(c) Agricultural and forest landowners and operators must comply with any applicable existing conservation plan, forest stewardship plan, or equivalent plan and all other applicable laws, regulations, or Executive Orders for any removal of eligible material for use in a biomass conversion facility to receive matching payments.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this part, a participant may receive, in addition to any payments under this part, financial assistance, rental or easement payments, tax benefits, or other payments from a State or a private organization in return for enrolling lands in BCAP, without any commensurate reduction in BCAP payments.
