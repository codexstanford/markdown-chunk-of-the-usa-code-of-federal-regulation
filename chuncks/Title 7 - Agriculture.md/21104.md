###### § 781.1 General.

The purpose of these regulations is to set forth the requirements designed to implement the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978. The regulations require that a foreign person who acquires, disposes of, or holds an interest in United States agricultural land shall disclose such transactions and holdings to the Secretary of Agriculture. In particular, the regulations establish a system for the collection of information by the Agricultural Stablization and Conservation Service (FSA) pertaining to foreign investment in United States agricultural land. The information collected will be utilized in the preparation of periodic reports to Congress and the President by the Economic Research Service (ERS) concerning the effect of such holdings upon family farms and rural communities.
