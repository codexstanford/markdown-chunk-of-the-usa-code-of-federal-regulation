(2) If a party served with such requests fails to respond timely, the requesting party may file a motion to compel production or deem admissions, as appropriate.

(3) A party served with such a request may file a motion for a protective order before the date on which a response to the discovery request is due, stating reasons why discovery should be limited or should not be required.

(4) Within 15 days of service of a motion to compel or to deem matter admitted or a motion for a protective order, the opposing party may file a response.

(5) The ALJ may grant a motion to compel production or deem matter admitted or may deny a motion for a protective order only if he finds that-

(ii) It is not unduly costly or burdensome;

(iii) It will not unduly delay the proceeding; and

(iv) The information sought is not privileged.

(d) Depositions and written interrogatories. Depositions and written interrogatories are permitted only on the order of the ALJ.

(3) The ALJ may grant a motion allowing the taking of a deposition or the use of interrogatories or may deny a motion for a protective order only if he finds that the moving party has satisfied the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section and has shown that the information sought cannot be obtained by any other means.

(4) If the ALJ grants a motion permitting a deposition, he shall issue a subpoena, which may also require the witness to produce documents. The party seeking to depose shall serve the subpoena in the manner prescribed in § 1.308 of this part.
