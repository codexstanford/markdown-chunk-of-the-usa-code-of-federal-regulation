####### § 923.54 Special purpose shipments.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any person may, without regard to the provisions of §§ 923.41, 923.52, 923.53, and 923.55, and the regulations issued thereunder, handle cherries (1) for consumption by charitable institutions; (2) for distribution by relief agencies; or (3) for commercial processing into products.

(b) Upon the basis of recommendations and information submitted by the committee, or from other available information, the Secretary may relieve from any or all requirements, under or established pursuant to § 923.41, § 923.52, § 923.53, or § 923.55, the handling of cherries in such minimum quantities, or types of shipments, or for such specified purposes, as the committee, with approval of the Secretary, may prescribe. Specified purposes under this section may include shipments of cherries for grading or packing to specified locations outside the production area and shipments to facilitate the conduct of marketing research and development projects established pursuant to § 923.45.

(c) The committee shall, with the approval of the Secretary, prescribe such rules, regulations, and safeguards as it may deem necessary to prevent cherries handled under the provisions of this section from entering the channels of trade for other than the specific purposes authorized by this section. Such rules, regulations, and safeguards may include the requirements that handlers shall file applications and receive approval from the committee for authorization to handle cherries pursuant to this section, and that such applications be accompanied by a certification by the intended purchaser or receiver that the cherries will not be used for any purpose not authorized by this section. The committee may rescind or deny to any packing facility the special purpose shipment certificate if proof satisfactory to the committee is obtained that cherries shipped for the purpose stated in this section were handled contrary to the provisions of this section.
