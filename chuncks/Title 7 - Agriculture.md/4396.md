####### § 46.35 Suspension or revocation order.

(a) Whenever the Secretary shall order the suspension or revocation of a license, the person against whom such order is directed shall be served by the Hearing Clerk with a copy of the order, and be notified of the effective date thereof. Service of orders shall be accomplished in accordance with § 47.4 of this chapter.

(b) Except in the case of any license automatically suspended by the Act, a reasonable time shall be allowed, which shall not be less than 10 days between the date of issuance of the order of suspension or revocation and the date upon which such order becomes effective, during which period the licensee may make all necessary arrangements with some other person, who has a valid and effective license to safeguard the interests of consignors or other innocent parties whose property or business may be affected by such suspension or revocation and during which the licensee may terminate his affairs and business relating to the handling of produce.

(c) After the revocation of his license or during the effective period of any suspension thereof, no person shall, either directly or indirectly, through any agent, employee, or otherwise, carry on the business of a commission merchant, dealer, or broker until his status as a licensee has been restored.

(d) The suspension or revocation of a license shall not prevent the licensee from collecting amounts due on contracts entered into prior to the date of suspension or revocation or from remitting promptly to his principals and obligees.
