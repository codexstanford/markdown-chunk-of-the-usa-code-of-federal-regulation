###### § 5001.118 Ineligible B&I projects

The following are ineligible projects for the B&I program only:

(a) The financing of timeshares, residential trailer parks, apartments, duplexes, or other residential housing where the primary purpose is independent housing except as authorized in § 5001.105(b)(8), or housing development sites except as authorized in § 5001.105(b)(1).

(b) Projects eligible for funding under B&I that are in excess of $1 million that would either:

(1) Likely result in the transfer of jobs from one area to another and increase direct employment by more than 50 employees. However, this limitation is not to be construed to prohibit assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary of such entity if the establishment of such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary will not result in an increase in unemployment in the area of original location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations. An exception is when there is reason to believe that such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity in the area or its original location or in any other area where it conducts such operations; or

(2) Increase direct employment by more than 50 employees, which is calculated to or likely to result in an increase in the production of goods, materials, commodities, or the availability of services or facilities in the area when there is not sufficient demand for such goods, materials, commodities, services, or facilities to employ the efficient capacity of existing competitive commercial or industrial enterprises, unless such financial or other assistance will not have an adverse effect upon existing competitive enterprises in the area.
