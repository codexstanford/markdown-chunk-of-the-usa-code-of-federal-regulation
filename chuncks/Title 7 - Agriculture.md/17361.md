###### § 400.456 Governmentwide debarment and suspension (nonprocurement).

(a) FCIC will proceed under 2 CFR parts 180 and 417 when taking action to suspend or debar persons involved in non-procurement transactions.

(b) Any person suspended or debarred under the provisions of 2 CFR parts 180 and 417, will not be eligible to contract with FCIC or the Risk Management Agency and will not be eligible to participate in or receive any benefit from any program under the Act during the period of ineligibility. This includes, but is not limited to, being employed by or contracting with any approved insurance provider, or its contractors, that sell, service, or adjust policies either insured or reinsured by FCIC. FCIC may waive this provision if it is satisfied that the approved insurance provider or contractors have taken sufficient action to ensure that the suspended or debarred person will not be involved in any way with the Federal crop insurance program or receive any benefit from any program under the Act.

(c) The Manager, FCIC, shall be the debarring and suspending official for all debarment or suspension proceedings undertaken by FCIC under the provisions of 2 CFR parts 180 and 417.
