(2) The criminal history report(s) submitted with the license application confirms that all key participants to be covered by the license have not been convicted of a felony, under State or Federal law, relating to a controlled substance within the past ten (10) years unless the exception in § 990.20(b) applies.

(3) The applicant, if the applicant was previously or is currently licensed, submitted all reports required as a participant in the hemp production program by this part.

(8) The State or territory of the Indian Tribe where the person produces or intends to produce hemp does not prohibit the production of hemp.

(b) USDA shall provide written notification to applicants whether the application has been approved or denied. USDA shall provide written notification to applicants in a State or territory of an Indian Tribe that has submitted a plan to USDA and is awaiting USDA approval that their application is being returned.

(1) If an application is approved, a license will be issued.

(c) If the applicant is producing in more than one State or territory of an Indian Tribe, the applicant may have more than one license to grow hemp. If the applicant has operations in a location covered under a State or Tribal plan, that operation must be licensed under the State or Tribal plan, not the USDA plan.
