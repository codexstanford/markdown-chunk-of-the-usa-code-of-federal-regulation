###### § 1.218 How much will I be charged?

(a) In the event that a demand is granted, the Department may charge reasonable fees. The appropriate Department official will determine all fees, if any, associated with this subpart and shall timely notify you of the fees, particularly those that are to be paid in advance.

(b) When a demand is granted under this subchapter to permit an employee to testify, you must pay the witness the fee and expenses, including any travel related costs, prescribed for attendance by the applicable rule of court. If no such fees are prescribed, the local Federal district court rule relating to witness fees for the Federal district court closest to where the witness appears will apply.

(c) When a demand is granted under this subchapter to produce documents, blueprints, electronic tapes, or other official information, the fees to be charged and paid prior to production shall be calculated as provided in Department regulations implementing the fee provisions of the FOIA.
