The regulations in 2 CFR 200.334 through 200.338 provide general record retention and access requirements for records pertaining to grants. In addition, the State must maintain and provide the Government access to pertinent records regarding services delivered by the State's Certified Mediation Program for purposes of evaluation, audit and monitoring of the State Certified Mediation Program as follows:

(a) For purposes of this section, pertinent records consist of: the names and addresses of applicants for mediation services; dates mediations opened and closed; issues mediated; dates of sessions with mediators; names of mediators; mediation services furnished to participants by the program; the sums charged to parties for each mediation service; records of delivery of services to prepare parties for mediation (including financial advisory and counseling services); and the outcome of the mediation services including formal settlement results and supporting documentation.

(b) State mediators will notify all participants in writing at the beginning of the mediation session that the USDA, including the USDA Inspector General, the Comptroller General of the United States, the Administrator, and any of their representatives will have access to pertinent records as necessary to monitor and to conduct audits, investigations, or evaluations of mediation services funded in whole or in part by the USDA.

(c) All participants in a mediation must sign and date an acknowledgment of receipt of such notice from the mediator. The State's Certified Mediation Program must maintain originals of such acknowledgments in its mediation files for at least 3 years.
