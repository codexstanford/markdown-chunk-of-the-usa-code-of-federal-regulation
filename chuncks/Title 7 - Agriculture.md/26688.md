(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each handler in making payments to producers for milk (other than milk of such handler's own production) pursuant to § ____.73 of each Federal milk order shall deduct an amount specified by the market administrator that is no more than 7 cents per hundredweight and shall pay the amount deducted to the market administrator not later than the payment receipt date specified under § ____.71 of each Federal milk order. The money shall be used by the market administrator to verify or establish weights, samples and tests of producer milk and provide market information for producers who are not receiving such services from a cooperative association. The services shall be performed in whole or in part by the market administrator or an agent engaged by and responsible to the market administrator.

(b) In the case of producers for whom the market administrator has determined that a cooperative association is actually performing the services set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, each handler shall make deductions from the payments to be made to producers as may be authorized by the membership agreement or marketing contract between the cooperative association and the producers. On or before the 15th day after the end of the month (except as provided in § 1000.90), such deductions shall be paid to the cooperative association rendering the services accompanied by a statement showing the amount of any deductions and the amount of milk for which the deduction was computed for each producer. These deductions shall be made in lieu of the deduction specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
