Each component shall ensure that its reading room and indices are reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.

(b) A link to USDA Electronic Reading Rooms can be found on the USDA public FOIA website.

(5) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released to a person pursuant to a FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), and which because of the nature of their subject matter, have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records.
