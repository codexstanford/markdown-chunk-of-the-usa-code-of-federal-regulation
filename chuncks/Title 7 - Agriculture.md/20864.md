####### § 769.156 Rates and terms.

(a) For loans to intermediaries:

(1) The rate of interest for an HPRP loan will bear a fixed rate over the term of the loan of 1 percent or less as determined by the Administrator;

(2) The repayment term for an HPRP loan will not exceed 30 years; and

(3) Annual payments will be established. Interest will be due annually; however, principal payments may be deferred by the Agency.

(b) Loans to the ultimate recipient from the HPRP revolving loan fund are required to have rates and terms clearly and publicly disclosed to qualified ultimate recipients.

(1) The interest rate for loans to ultimate recipients will be set by the intermediary within the limits established by the intermediary's relending plan approved by the Agency. The rate should normally be the lowest rate sufficient to cover the loan's proportional share of the HPRP revolving loan fund's debt service costs, reserve for bad debts, and administrative costs.

(2) Loans made by an intermediary to an ultimate recipient will be scheduled for repayment over a term negotiated by the intermediary and ultimate recipient; but in no case will the loan term exceed 30 years, unless otherwise specified by the Agency.
