####### § 1944.502 Policy.

(a) The policy of the Rural Development is to provide Technical and Supervisory Assistance to eligible applicants to do the following:

(1) Provide homeownership and financial counseling to reduce both the potential for delinquency by loan applicants and the level of payment delinquency by present Rural Development housing loan borrowers; and

(2) Facilitate the delivery of housing programs to serve the most needy low-income families in rural areas of greatest need for housing.

(b) Rural Development intends to fund projects which include counseling and delivery of housing programs.

(c) State Directors are given a strong role in the selection of grantees so this program can complement Rural Development's policies of targeting Rural Development resources to areas of greatest need within their States.

(d) Rural Development expects grant recipients to implement a TSA program and not to use TSA funds to prepare housing plans and strategies except as necessary to accomplish the specific objectives of the TSA project.
