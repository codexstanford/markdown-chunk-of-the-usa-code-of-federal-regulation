###### § 460.4 Calculating prevented planting supplemental disaster payments.

(b) For all other insured crops, the payment under this subpart for each insured crop will be calculated by summing the qualifying prevented planting payments for that insured crop and multiplying the total by the prevent plant base factor.

(c) If a qualifying prevented planting payment is reduced for any reason, such as the participant planting a second crop, the payment under this subpart will be based on the amount of the qualifying prevented planting payment after any such reduction.
