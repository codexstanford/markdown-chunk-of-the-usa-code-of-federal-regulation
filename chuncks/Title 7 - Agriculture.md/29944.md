(1) MYA price received by producers during the 12-month marketing year for the crop year of the covered commodity, as determined by FSA, or

(2) National loan rate for a marketing assistance loan for the covered commodity for such crop year.

(c) The payment rate used to calculate PLC payments with respect to covered commodity for which PLC yields and base acres are attributed to the covered commodity on a farm enrolled in a PLC contract is the effective reference price of the covered commodity minus the effective price of the covered commodity for a crop year, as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) The relevant payment acres of the covered commodity, as applicable, minus any payment acre reduction in accordance with § 1412.46, multiplied by

(3) The PLC payment yield for the covered commodity on the farm enrolled in a PLC contract as determined in accordance with § 1412.31, minus

(4) Any reduction calculated in accordance with subpart F of this part.
