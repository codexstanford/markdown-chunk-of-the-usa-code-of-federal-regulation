(4) Determined by FSA to be eligible crops for which:

(i) Catastrophic risk protection and additional coverage under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508(b), (c), and (h)) are not available or, if coverage is available, it is only available under a policy that provides coverage for specific intervals based on weather indexes or under a whole farm plan of insurance; or

(ii) These specific practices for these crops are not included under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508), but only when the Deputy Administrator determines in advance of a coverage period that the specific practice is appropriate for NAP coverage and is not available for coverage under Federal crop insurance.

(2) For not more than any 4 crop years for native sod acreage that has been tilled for the production of any crop after December 20, 2018:

(i) During the first 10 crop years after the initial tillage; and

(ii) For which a NAP applicant must submit a service fee or NAP premium for a crop on that acreage.

(1) The approved yield will be determined by using a yield equal to 65 percent of the producer's T-yield for the annually planted crop; and

(2) The service fee or premium for the annual covered crop planted on native sod will be equal to 200 percent of the amount determined in § 1437.7, as applicable, but the premium will not exceed the maximum amount specified in § 1437.7(d)(2).
