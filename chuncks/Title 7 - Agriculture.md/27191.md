###### Definitions
####### § 1126.13 Producer milk.
######## Producer milk

means the skim milk (or the skim equivalent of components of skim milk), including nonfat components, and butterfat contained in milk of a producer that is:

(a) Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from a producer or a handler described in § 1000.9(c). All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received;

(b) Received by a handler described in § 1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants;

(c) Diverted by a pool plant operator for the account of the handler operating such plant to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or

(d) Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or a handler described in § 1000.9(c) to a nonpool plant, subject to the following conditions:

(1) Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion unless a delivery of at least 40,000 pounds or one day's milk production, whichever is less, of such dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant and the dairy farmer has continuously retained producer status since that time;

(2) The total quantity of milk diverted during the month by a cooperative association shall not exceed 50 percent of the total quantity of producer milk that the cooperative association caused to be received at pool plants and diverted;

(3) The operator of a pool plant that is not a cooperative association may divert any milk that is not under the control of a cooperative association that diverts milk during the month pursuant to this paragraph. The total quantity of milk so diverted during the month shall not exceed 50 percent of the total quantity of the producer milk physically received at such plant (or such unit of plants in the case of plants that pool as a unit pursuant to § 1126.7(e)) and diverted;

(4) Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section shall not be producer milk. If the diverting handler or cooperative association fails to designate the dairy farmers' deliveries that will not be producer milk, no milk diverted by the handler or cooperative association shall be producer milk;

(5) Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; and

(6) The delivery requirement in paragraph (d)(1) and the diversion percentages in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if there is a finding that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise the delivery day requirement or any diversion percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.
