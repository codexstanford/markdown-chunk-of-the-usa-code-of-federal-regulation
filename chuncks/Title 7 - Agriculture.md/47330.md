If any of the guaranteed portion has been purchased by the Agency, the Agency (as a Holder) will affirm or reject Interest rate change proposals in writing.

(2) The Interest rates, after adjustments, must comply with the requirements for Interest rates on new loans as established by § 4279.233 of this chapter.

(3) The Lender is responsible for the legal documentation of Interest rate changes by an endorsement or any other legally effective amendment to the Promissory Note; however, no new Promissory Notes may be issued. The Lender must provide copies of all legal documents to the Agency.
