(1) Continue in such capacity until discharged by the Secretary;

(2) Carry out the obligations of the Board under any contracts or agreements entered into by it pursuant to § 1210.328(d);

(3) From time-to-time account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property on hand, together with all books and records of the Board and of the trustees, to person or persons as the Secretary may direct; and

(4) Upon the request of the Secretary execute such assignments or other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such person or persons full title and right to all the funds, property, and claims vested in the Board or the trustees pursuant to this section.

(c) Any person to whom funds, property, or claims have been transferred or delivered pursuant to this section shall be subject to the same obligation imposed upon the Board and upon the trustees.

(d) A reasonable effort shall be made by the Board or its trustees to return to producers, handlers and importers any residual funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation.
