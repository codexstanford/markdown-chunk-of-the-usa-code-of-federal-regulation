The committee from time to time may conduct surveys of handling of potatoes for special purposes requiring Certificates of Privilege to determine whether handlers are complying with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee finds that a handler or consignee is failing to comply with requirements and regulations applicable to handling of potatoes in special outlets, and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and further certificates denied. Such disqualification shall apply to, and not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the succeeding fiscal period. Any handler who has a certificate rescinded or denied may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration of his disqualification.
