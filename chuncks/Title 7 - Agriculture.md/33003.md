(2) If a recipient determines that compliance with one or more of the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section poses an imminent threat of injury, loss of life, or destruction of property in the target country, the recipient must submit a request to CCC for a waiver of such requirement(s), with an explanation of the safety or security risk, as soon as possible. The recipient will not have to comply with such requirement(s) while awaiting a determination by CCC regarding its waiver request.
