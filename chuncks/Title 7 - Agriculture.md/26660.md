###### § 1000.44 Classification of producer milk.

For each month the market administrator shall determine for each handler described in § 1000.9(a) for each pool plant of the handler separately and for each handler described in § 1000.9(c) and § 1135.11 of this chapter the classification of producer milk by allocating the handler's receipts of skim milk and butterfat to the handler's gross utilization of such receipts pursuant to § 1000.43(b)(3) as follows:

(a) Skim milk shall be allocated in the following manner:

(1) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class I the pounds of skim milk in:

(i) Receipts of packaged fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;

(ii) Packaged fluid milk products in inventory at the beginning of the month. This paragraph shall apply only if the pool plant was subject to the provisions of this paragraph or comparable provisions of another Federal order in the immediately preceding month;

(iii) Fluid milk products received in packaged form from plants regulated under other Federal orders; and

(iv) To the extent that the receipts described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section exceed the gross Class I utilization of skim milk, the excess receipts shall be subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(vi) of this section.

(2) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk in Class II the pounds of skim milk in the receipts of skim milk in bulk concentrated fluid milk products and in other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated fluid milk product or a fluid cream product) that is used to produce, or added to, any product in Class II (excluding the quantity of such skim milk that was classified as Class IV milk pursuant to § 1000.40(d)(3)). To the extent that the receipts described in this paragraph exceed the gross Class II utilization of skim milk, the excess receipts shall be subtracted pursuant to paragraph (a)(3)(vi) of this section.

(3) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class IV, the pounds of skim milk in:

(i) Receipts of bulk concentrated fluid milk products and other source milk (except other source milk received in the form of an unconcentrated fluid milk product);

(ii) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products for which appropriate health approval is not established and from unidentified sources;

(iii) Receipts of fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products from an exempt plant;

(iv) Fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products received from a producer-handler as defined under the order in this part, or any other Federal order;

(v) Receipts of fluid milk products from dairy farmers for other markets; and

(vi) The excess receipts specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (a)(2) of this section.

(4) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes other than Class I, in sequence beginning with Class IV, the receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant that were not previously subtracted in this section for which the handler requests classification other than Class I, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in these other classes combined.

(5) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes other than Class I, in sequence beginning with Class IV, receipts of fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant that were not previously subtracted in this section, and which are in excess of the pounds of skim milk determined pursuant to paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section;

(i) Multiply by 1.25 the pounds of skim milk remaining in Class I at this allocation step; and

(ii) Subtract from the result in paragraph (a)(5)(i) the pounds of skim milk in receipts of producer milk and fluid milk products from other pool plants.

(6) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes other than Class I, in sequence beginning with Class IV, the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from a handler regulated under another Federal order that are in excess of bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such handler, if other than Class I classification is requested, but not in excess of the pounds of skim milk remaining in these classes combined.

(7) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class, in series beginning with Class IV, the pounds of skim milk in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products in inventory at the beginning of the month that were not previously subtracted in this section.

(8) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at the plant receipts of skim milk in fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant that were not previously subtracted in this section and that were not offset by transfers or diversions of fluid milk products to the unregulated supply plant from which fluid milk products to be allocated at this step were received. Such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds of skim milk in Class I and in Classes II, III, and IV combined, with the quantity prorated to Classes II, III, and IV combined being subtracted in sequence beginning with Class IV.

(9) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from a handler regulated under another Federal order that are in excess of bulk fluid milk products transferred or diverted to such handler that were not subtracted in paragraph (a)(6) of this section. Such subtraction shall be pro rata to the pounds of skim milk in Class I and in Classes II, III, and IV combined, with the quantity prorated to Classes II, III, and IV combined being subtracted in sequence beginning with Class IV, with respect to whichever of the following quantities represents the lower proportion of Class I milk:

(i) The estimated utilization of skim milk of all handlers in each class as announced for the month pursuant to § 1000.45(a); or

(ii) The total pounds of skim milk remaining in each class at this allocation step.

(10) Subtract from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class the pounds of skim milk in receipts of fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products from another pool plant and from a handler described in § 1135.11 of this chapter according to the classification of such products pursuant to § 1000.42(a).

(11) If the total pounds of skim milk remaining in all classes exceed the pounds of skim milk in producer milk, subtract such excess from the pounds of skim milk remaining in each class in series beginning with Class IV.

(b) Butterfat shall be allocated in accordance with the procedure outlined for skim milk in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The quantity of producer milk in each class shall be the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat remaining in each class after the computations pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
