####### § 91.36 Appeal laboratory certificate.

(a) An appeal laboratory certificate shall be issued showing the results of such appealed analysis. This certificate shall supersede the laboratory certificate previously issued for the commodity product involved.

(b) Each appeal laboratory certificate shall clearly identify the number and date of the laboratory certificate which it supersedes. The superseded certificate shall become null and void upon the issuance of the appealed laboratory certificate and shall no longer represent the analytical results of the commodity product.

(c) The individual issuing an appeal laboratory certificate shall forward notice of such issuance to such persons as he or she considers necessary to prevent misuse of the superseded certificate if the original and all copies of such superseded certificate have not previously been delivered to the individual issuing the appeal certificate.

(d) The provisions in the regulations in this part concerning forms and certificates, issuance of certificates, and retention and disposition of certificates shall apply to appeal laboratory certificates, except that copies of such appeal certificates shall be furnished to all interested parties who received copies of the superseded certificate.
