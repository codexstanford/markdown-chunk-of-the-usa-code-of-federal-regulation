(b) Participants who exceed the average adjusted gross income limitation for NAP payment eligibilityfor the applicable crop year may meet the purchase requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by purchasing Whole-Farm Revenue Protection crop insurance coverage, if eligible, or paying the NAP service fee and premium even though the participant will not be eligible to receive a NAP payment due to the average adjusted gross income limit.

(c) The final crop year to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is the 2023 crop year.

(d) A participant who obtained crop insurance or NAP coverage for the crop in accordance with the requirements for WHIP+ in § 760.1517 is considered to have met the requirement to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage for the QLA Program.

(e) If a producer fails to obtain crop insurance or NAP coverage as required in this section, the producer must reimburse FSA for the full amount of QLA Program payment plus interest. A producer will only be considered to have obtained NAP coverage for the purposes of this section if the participant submitted a NAP application for coverage and paid the requisite NAP service fee and any applicable premium by the applicable deadline and completed all program requirements required under the coverage agreement, including filing an acreage report.
