####### § 1951.264 Action when borrower fails to cooperate, respond or graduate.

(a) When borrowers with other than FCP loans fail to:

(1) Provide information following receipt of both FmHA Guide Letters 1951-1 and 1951-2 (available in any Agency office), or letters of similar format, they are in default of the terms of their security instruments. The approval official may, when appropriate, accelerate the account based on the borrower's failure to perform as required by this subpart and the loan and security instruments.

(2) Apply for or accept other credit following receipt of both FmHA Guide Letters 1951- 5 and 1951-6 (available in any Agency office), or letters of similar format, they are in default under the graduation requirement of their security instruments. If the Agency determines the borrower is able to graduate, foreclosure action will be initiated in accordance with § 1955.15(d)(2)(ii). If the borrower's account is accelerated, the borrower may appeal the decision.

(b) If an FCP borrower fails to cooperate after a lender expresses a willingness to consider refinancing the Agency loan, the account will be referred for legal action.
