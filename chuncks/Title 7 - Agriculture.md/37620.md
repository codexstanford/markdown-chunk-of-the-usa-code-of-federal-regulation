###### § 1786.104 Loan fund audit.

RUS shall have the right to audit within 6 months of closing, transactions involving the RUS construction fund established and maintained by the borrower pursuant to the terms of the RUS Loan Agreement and to inspect all books, records, accounts and other documents and papers of the borrower. Should RUS determine that the borrower has made disbursements of funds advanced pursuant to RUS Notes which do not comply with the requirements of the RUS Loan Agreement, the borrower shall be required to pay the Government an amount equal to the difference between the amount which the borrower prepaid on such RUS Notes evidencing RUS loans funds which were improperly disbursed and the amount which the borrower would otherwise have been required to return to the Government as a result of noncompliance if the borrower had not prepaid such RUS Notes. (See 7 CFR part 1721, Post-Loan Policies and Procedures for Insured Electric Loans.)
