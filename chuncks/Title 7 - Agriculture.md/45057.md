###### § 3560.553 Loan and grant purposes.

(a) In addition to the purposes stated in § 3560.53, off-farm labor housing loan and grant funds may be used to provide facilities for seasonal or temporary residential use with appropriate furnishings and equipment. A temporary residence is a dwelling which is used for occupancy, usually for a short period of time, but is not the legal domicile for the occupant.

(b) The Agency may award technical assistance grants to eligible private and public nonprofit agencies. These grant recipients will, in turn, assist other organizations to obtain loans and grants for the construction of farm labor housing.

(c) Technical assistance services may not be used to reimburse a nonprofit or public body applicant for technical services provided by a nonprofit organization, with housing and/or community development experience, to assist the nonprofit applicant entity in the development and packaging of its loan/grant docket and project. In addition, technical assistance will not be funded by the Agency when an identity of interest exists between the technical assistance provider and the loan or grant applicant.
