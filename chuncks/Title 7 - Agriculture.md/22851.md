(b) The warehouse operator must:

(1) At the request of a depositor of an agricultural product stored or handled in a warehouse licensed under the Act, issue a warehouse receipt to the depositor;

(2) Not issue a warehouse receipt for an agricultural product unless the agricultural product is actually stored in their warehouse at the time of issuance;

(3) Not issue a warehouse receipt until the quality, condition and weight of such an agricultural product is ascertained by a licensed inspector and weigher;

(4) Not directly or indirectly compel or attempt to compel the depositor to request the issuance of a warehouse receipt omitting the statement of quality or condition;

(9) Deliver, upon proper presentation of a warehouse receipt for any agricultural product, and payment or tender of all advances and charges, to the depositor or lawful holder of such warehouse receipt the agricultural product of such identity, quantity, grade and condition as set forth in such warehouse receipt.
