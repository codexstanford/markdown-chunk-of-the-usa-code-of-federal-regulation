###### Impulse noise measurement.

(g)(1) When specified by the borrower, impulse noise measurements shall be made on trunk circuits and nonloaded subscriber loops. For trunk circuits, the measurement shall be made between CO locations. For nonloaded subscriber loops, the measurement shall be made from the CO to the station protector of the NID at the customer's access location.

(2) Impulse noise is a measure of the presence of unusually large noise excursions of short duration that are beyond the normal background noise levels on a facility. Impulse noise is typically measured by counting the number of occurrences beyond a particular noise reference threshold in a given time interval. The noise reference level is C-message weighted.
