##### PART 623 - EMERGENCY WETLANDS RESERVE PROGRAM
###### § 623.9 Easement priority.

The State Conservationist, in consultation with the FWS and with input from a technical committee and other interested Federal agencies, will establish a ranking process to establish the priority of parcels offered into the EWRP. This process will rank the floodway enhancement and environmental benefits per dollar of government expenditure on restoration and easement purchase. The factors for determining the priority for selection will consider the following:

(a) Protection and enhancement of habitat for migratory birds and wildlife, including the contribution the restoration may make to the recovery of threatened and endangered species,

(b) Floodway expansion,

(c) Proximity to other protected wetlands,

(d) Level of hydrology restored,

(e) Wetland function or values,

(f) Likelihood of successful restoration of wetland values,

(g) Cost of restoration and easement purchase, and

(h) Other factors as determined appropriate by NRCS.
