(a) When the Chief so determines, NRCS may offer to fund a proposal through an alternative funding arrangement or grant agreement under this section.

(b) In determining whether to offer to fund a proposal through an alternative funding arrangement or grant agreement, the Chief will consider the extent to which the proposal:

(1) Will achieve conservation benefits on a regional or watershed scale;

(2) Involves investments in infrastructure related to agricultural or nonindustrial private forest production that would benefit multiple producers and address natural resource concerns such as drought, wildfire, or water quality impairment on the land within the proposal area;

(3) Addresses natural resource concerns, including the development and implementation of watershed, habitat, or other area restoration plans;

(4) Uses innovative approaches to leverage the Federal investment with private financial mechanisms, such as:

(i) Provision of performance-based payments to producers, or

(ii) Support for an environmental market; and

(5) Otherwise demonstrates that the goals and objectives of the program would be more easily achieved by offering to fund the proposal through an alternative funding arrangement or grant agreement under this section.

(c) The terms of an alternative funding arrangement or grant agreement may be made expressly in the partnership agreement and may include providing financial assistance directly to the lead partner or to nonlead partners through supplemental agreements.

(d) NRCS will not enter into more than 15 partnership agreements funded through an alternative funding arrangement or grant agreement each fiscal year.
