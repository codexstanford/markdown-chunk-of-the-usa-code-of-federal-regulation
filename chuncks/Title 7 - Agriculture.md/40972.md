####### Exhibit C to Subpart A of Part 1962 - Memorandum of Understanding Between Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and Commodity Credit Corporation

Under the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) Farmer-Owned Grain Reserve Program, a producer may request to rotate or exchange new crop grain for the original crop grain that is in the Farmer-Owned Grain Reserve Program and already encumbered by CCC. The Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 (FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354) may have subordinated their first lien position to CCC on the original grain placed in reserve and/or may have a first lien on the new crop. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and CCC desire to devise a mechanism whereby the CCC can relinquish its first lien position on the original grain reserve crop to FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and in turn the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 can relinquish its first lien position to CCC on the replacement grain reserve crop.

Now, therefore, it is agreed as follows:

(1) Upon receipt of a memorandum from an Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) County Executive Director or other designated county office official requesting the rotation of a grain reserve crop for a producer borrower(s), the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 County Supervisor and the ASCS county office official will jointly indicate approval or rejection of the request on the bottom of the original and a copy of the memorandum (Approval Memorandum) as follows:

"We hereby agree to and authorize the rotation of the subject producer's grain crops in accordance with the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding between Farmers Home Administration or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 and Commodity Credit Corporation dated________."

In the memorandum, ASCS will include the name(s) of the producer(s) desiring to rotate the grain crops, the approximate number of bushels being rotated, the type of crop, years' crop being rotated and the location of the original grain reserve crop (approximate land and facility description).

(2) Upon execution of the Approval Memorandum by both ASCS and FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354, the security interest of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in the new crop grain shall be subordinated to the security interest of CCC in such grain and the security interest of CCC in the original crop grain shall be subordinated to the security interest of FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 in such grain. At that point in time it will be the responsibility of each agency and the borrower to account for their respective interests in the grain crops and/or proceeds from the sale of the grain. The crop rotation and subordination of liens will only involve the amount of grain that has been specifically provided for in the memorandum from ASCS.

(3) If there is an intervening third party lien and it is impossible for FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or CCC to have a first lien on their respective grain crops, the request of the producer to rotate crops will not be granted.

(4) Nothing contained in this Memorandum of Understanding shall be construed to affect the rights and obligations of the parties except as specifically provided herein.

(5) This agreement may be terminated by either party on 30 days written notice to the other party.
