(a) A participant on a farm is eligible for assistance under this section with respect to losses to an insurable commodity or NAP if the participant:

(1) In the case of an insurable commodity, obtained a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act for the crop incurring the losses; or

(2) In the case of a NAP covered crop, filed the required paperwork and paid the administrative fee by the applicable filing deadline, for the noninsurable commodity under section 196 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 for the crop incurring the losses.

(b) The reasons a participant either elected not to have coverage or did not have coverage mentioned in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section are not relevant to the determination of the participant's ineligibility under this section.
