(a) A MAP Participant shall implement and maintain a financial management system that conforms to generally accepted accounting principles and complies with the standards in 2 CFR part 200.

(b) A MAP Participant shall institute internal controls and provide written guidance to commercial entities participating in its activities to ensure their compliance with these regulations.

(c) A MAP Participant shall retain all records concerning a MAP program transaction for a period of five years after completion of the transaction and permit authorized officials of the U.S. Government to have full and complete access, for such five-year period, to such records. These records shall include all documents related to employment of any employees whose salaries are reimbursed in whole or in part with MAP funds, whether such employees are based in the United States or overseas, such as employment applications, contracts, position descriptions, leave records, salary changes, and all records pertaining to contractors.

(d) A MAP Participant shall also maintain adequate documentation related to the proper disposition of all personal property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition cost of $500 or more purchased by the Participant and for which the Participant is reimbursed, in whole or in part, with MAP funds.

(e) A MAP Participant shall maintain its records of expenditures, contributions, and cost share in a manner that allows it to provide information by program year, activity plan, country or region (as applicable), activity number, and cost category. Such records shall include copies of:

(1) Receipts for all STRE (actual vendor invoices or restaurant checks, rather than credit card receipts);

(2) Receipts for any other program-related expenditure in excess of a minimum level that CCC shall determine and announce in writing to all MAP Participants via a program notice issued on the FAS website. Receipts for all actual M&IE reimbursements must be maintained, regardless of the amount;

(3) The exchange rate used to calculate the dollar equivalent of expenditures made in a foreign currency and the basis for such calculation;

(4) Reimbursement claims;

(5) An itemized list of claims charged to each of the MAP Participant's MAP accounts;

(6) Documentation, with accompanying English translation, supporting each reimbursement claim, including evidence to support the financial transactions, such as canceled checks, receipted paid bills, contracts, purchase orders, per diem calculations, travel vouchers, and credit memos; and

(7)(i) Each MAP Participant must keep records documenting all claimed contributions and cost share, to include:

(A) Copies of invoices or receipts for expenses paid by the U.S. industry or State agency and not reimbursed by the MAP Participant for the joint activity, or

(B) If invoices are not available, an itemized statement from the U.S. industry or State agency as to what costs it incurred pursuant to the joint activity, or

(C) If neither of the foregoing is available, a statement from the U.S. industry or State agency as to what goods and services it provided, or

(D) If none of the foregoing are available, a memo to the files of the MAP Participant's estimate of what contribution or cost share was made by the U.S. industry or State agency, item by item, and the method used to assign a value to each.

(ii) The documentation required in paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section must include the dates, purpose, and location of the activity for which the cash or in-kind items were claimed as a contribution or cost share, who conducted the activity, the participating groups or individuals, and the method of computing the claimed contribution or cost share. MAP Participants must retain and make available for compliance reviews and audits documentation related to claimed contribution or cost share.

(f) Upon request, a MAP Participant shall provide documents supporting reimbursement claims to CCC. CCC may deny a claim for reimbursement if the claim is not supported by adequate documentation.
