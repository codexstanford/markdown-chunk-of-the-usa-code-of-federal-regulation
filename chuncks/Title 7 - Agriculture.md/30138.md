To be eligible, the loss must be incurred in combination with a loss described in paragraphs (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. The additional costs incurred must have been incurred for losses suffered in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred. Eligible adverse weather or eligible loss conditions, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, include, but not limited to, blizzard, eligible winter storms, flood, hurricane, lightning, tidal surge, tornado, volcanic eruption, or wildfire on non-Federal land;
