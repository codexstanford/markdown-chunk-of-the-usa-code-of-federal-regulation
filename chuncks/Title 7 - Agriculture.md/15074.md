(a) The Deputy Administrator will list as a regulated area each State or portion of a State in which evidence of a reproducing population of pink bollworm is present, or in which there is reason to believe that pink bollworm is present, or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area and a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions of these terms in § 301.52-1. The Deputy Administrator will publish a list of all regulated areas, including the suppressive and generally infested areas therein, atThe list will include the date that the list was last updated.
