###### § 301.45-5 Issuance and cancellation of certificates, limited permits, and outdoor household article documents.

(a) A certificate may be issued by an inspector for the movement of a regulated article or an outdoor household article (OHA) if the inspector determines that it is eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all Federal domestic plant quarantines applicable to such article and:

(1) It has originated in noninfested premises in a quarantined area and has not been exposed to the gypsy moth while within the quarantined area; or

(2) The inspector inspects the article no more than 5 days prior to the date of movement during the months of April through August (14 days prior to the date of movement from September through March) and finds it to be free of the gypsy moth; or

(3) It has been treated under the direction of an inspector to destroy the gypsy moth in accordance with the treatment manual and part 305 of this chapter; or

(4) It has been grown, produced, manufactured, stored, or handled in such a manner that no infestation would be transmitted thereby as determined by an inspector.

(b) Limited permits may be issued by an inspector to allow interstate movement of any regulated article under this subpart to specified destinations for specified handling, utilization, processing, or treatment in accordance with the treatment manual, when, upon evaluation of all of the circumstances involved in each case, the Administrator determines that such movement will not result in the spread of the gypsy moth because life stages of the moths will be destroyed by such specified handling, utilization, processing or treatment, or the pest will not survive in areas to which shipped, and the requirements of all other applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines have been met.

(c) Certificate and limited permit forms may be issued by an inspector to any person for use for subsequent shipments of regulated articles provided the person is operating under a compliance agreement. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may reproduce the forms as needed to attach them to regulated articles moved under a compliance agreement. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may execute and issue the certificate forms or reproduction of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles from the premises of such person identified in the compliance agreement, if the person has treated such regulated articles as specified in the compliance agreement, and if the regulated articles are eligible for certification for movement to any destination under all applicable Federal domestic plant quarantines. Any person operating under a compliance agreement may execute and issue the limited permit forms, or reproductions of such forms, for the interstate movement of regulated articles to specified destinations when an inspector has made the determinations specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) A certificate may be issued by a qualified certified applicator for the interstate movement of any outdoor household article or mobile home if such qualified certified applicator determines the following:

(1) That the article has been inspected by the qualified certified applicator and found to be free of any life stage of the gypsy moth; or

(2) That the article has been treated by, or treated under the direct supervision of, the qualified certified applicator to destroy any life stage of the gypsy moth in accordance with methods and procedures prescribed in section III of the Gypsy Moth Program Manual.

(e) An OHA document may be issued by the owner of an outdoor household article for the interstate movement of the article if such person has inspected the outdoor household article and has found it to be free of any life stage of gypsy moth.

(f) Any certificate or permit which has been issued or authorized may be withdrawn by an inspector if he determines that the holder thereof has not complied with any condition for the use of such document. The reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances permit. Any person whose certificate or permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within ten (10) days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal shall state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or permit was wrongfully withdrawn. The Administrator shall grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for his decision as promptly as circumstances permit. If there is a conflict as to any material fact, a hearing shall be held to resolve such conflict. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
