(a) Generally loans are processed in chronological order based on the date the complete application is received in the Regional office.

(b) The Administrator may give priority to processing loans that are required to meet the following needs:

(1) To restore electric service following a major storm or other catastrophe;

(2) To bring existing electric facilities into compliance with any environmental requirements imposed by Federal or state law that were not in effect at the time the facilities were originally constructed;

(3) To finance the capital needs of borrowers that are the result of a merger, consolidation, or a transfer of a system substantially in its entirety, provided that the merger, consolidation, or transfer has either been approved by RUS or does not need RUS approval pursuant to the borrower's loan documents (See 7 CFR 1717.154); or

(4) To correct serious safety problems, other than those resulting from borrower mismanagement or negligence.

(c) The Administrator may also change the normal order of processing loan applications when it is necessary to ensure that all loan authority for the fiscal year is utilized.
