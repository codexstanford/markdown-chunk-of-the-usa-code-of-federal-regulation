The Under Secretary for Rural Development (or designee) may, in individual cases, make an exception to any requirements of this subpart not required by the authorizing statute if the Administrator finds that application of such requirement would adversely affect the interest of the Government, or adversely affect the accomplishment of the purposes of the HPG program, or result in undue hardship by applying the requirement. The Administrator or the Assistant Administrator for Housing may exercise this exception authority at the request of the State Director. The request must be supported by information demonstrating the adverse impact, citing the particular requirement involved, recommending proper alternative course(s) of action, and outlining how the adverse impact could be mitigated. Exception to any requirement may also be initiated by the Assistant Administrator for Housing.
