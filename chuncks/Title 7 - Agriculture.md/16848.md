(c) The Deputy Administrator also may set forth and publish, in administrative instructions, requirements and conditions for any class of products or articles supplemental to the regulations in this part, and may promulgate interpretations of this part.

(d) The Deputy Administrator shall employ procedures to carry out the purposes of this part which will impose a minimum of impediment to foreign commerce, consistent with proper precaution against plant pest, noxious weed, or biological control organism dissemination.
