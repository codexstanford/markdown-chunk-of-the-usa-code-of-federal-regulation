(a) A person, legal entity, joint operation, or Indian Tribe that is determined to have erroneously represented any fact affecting a program determination made in accordance with this part will not be entitled to payments under RCPP and must refund to NRCS all RCPP payments, plus interest, determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter.

(b) A participant will lose all interest in all contracts or agreements with NRCS and will refund to NRCS all payments, plus interest determined in accordance with part 1403 of this chapter, received by such participant with respect to all contracts and agreements if it is determined that the participant has knowingly:

(1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of the program;

(2) Made any fraudulent representation to NRCS;

(3) Adopted any scheme or device for the purpose of depriving any tenant or sharecropper of the payments to which such person would otherwise be entitled under the program; or

(4) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

(c) If NRCS determines that a participant has violated the terms of a program contract, a lead partner has violated the terms of a partnership agreement, or a lead partner or nonlead partner has violated the terms of a supplemental agreement, NRCS may determine that the severity of the violation renders the participant, lead partner, or nonlead partner, respectively, ineligible for future NRCS conservation program consideration in accordance with applicable suspension and debarment regulations.
