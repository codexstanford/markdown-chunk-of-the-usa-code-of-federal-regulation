####### § 91.28 Issuance of corrected certificates or amendments for analysis reports.

(a) A corrected certificate of analysis or an amended letter report may be issued by the laboratory representative who issued the original certificate or report after distribution of the form if errors, such as incorrect dates, analytical results, or test determination statements, lot numbers, or errors in any other pertinent information require the issuance of a corrected certificate or an amended report.

(b) Whenever a corrected certificate or amended report is issued, such certificate or report shall supersede the original form which was issued in error. The superseded certificate or incorrect report shall become null and void after the issuance of the corrected certificate or the amended analysis report.

(c) The corrected certificates or amended reports shall show the following:

(1) The terms "Corrected Original" and "Corrected Copy;"

(2) A statement identifying the superseded certificate or incorrect letter report and the corrections;

(3) A new serial number or new date of issuance; and

(4) The same statements and information, including permissive statements, that were shown on the incorrect certificate or the incorrect report, along with the correct statement or information, shall be shown on the corrected form.

(d) If all copies of the incorrect certificate or incorrect report can be obtained, then the superseded form shall be marked "Void" when submitted.

(e) Corrected certificates or amended letter reports cannot be issued for a certificate that has been superseded by another certificate, or superseded on the basis of a subsequent analysis or an additional laboratory test determination.
