####### Payments to Dairy Farmers for Milk
######## § 760.3 Indemnity payments on milk.

(a) The amount of an indemnity payment for milk, including, but not limited to organic milk, made to an affected farmer who is determined by the county committee to be in compliance with all the terms and conditions of this subpart will be in the amount of the fair market value of the farmer's normal marketings for the application period, as determined in accordance with §§ 760.4 and 760.5, less:

(1) Any amount the affected farmer received for whole milk marketed during the application period; and

(2) Any payment not subject to refund that the affected farmer received from a milk handler with respect to milk removed from the commercial market during the application period.

(b) The eligible period for Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) benefits for milk for the same loss is limited to 3 calendar months from when the first claim for milk benefits is approved. Upon written request from an affected farmer on the milk indemnity form authorized by the Deputy Administrator, the Deputy Administrator may authorize, at the Deputy Administrator's discretion, additional months of benefits for the affected farmer for milk due to extenuating circumstances, which may include allowing additional time for public agency approval of a removal plan for cow indemnification and confirmation of site disposal for affected cows. Additionally, the Deputy Administrator has discretion to approve additional months based on issues that are beyond the control of the affected farmer who is seeking cow indemnification, as well as when the affected farmer is following a plan to reduce chemical residues in milk, cows, and heifers to marketable levels.
