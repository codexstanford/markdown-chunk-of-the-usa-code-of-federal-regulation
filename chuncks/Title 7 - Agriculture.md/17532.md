(a) Application for insurance, developed in accordance with standards established by FCIC, must be made by any person who wishes to participate in the program in order to cover such person's share in the insured crop as landlord, owner-operator, tenant, or other crop ownership interest.

(1) No other person's interest in the crop may be insured under the application.

(2) To obtain coverage, the application must be submitted to the insurance provider on or before the applicable sales closing date on file in the insurance provider's local office.

(b) FCIC or the insurance provider may reject, no longer accept applications, or cancel existing insurance contracts upon the FCIC's determination that the insurance risk is excessive. Such determination must be made not later than 15 days before the cancellation date for the crop and may be made on an area, county, state, or crop basis.
