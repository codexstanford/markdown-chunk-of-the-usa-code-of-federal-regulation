###### § 1726.26 Interest on overdue accounts.

Certain RUS contract forms contain a provision concerning payment of interest on overdue accounts. Prior to issuing the invitation to bidders, the borrower must insert an interest rate equal to the lowest "Prime Rate" listed in the "Money Rates" section of the Wall Street Journal on the date such invitation to bid is issued. If no prime rate is published on that date, the last such rate published prior to that date must be used. The rate must not, however, exceed the maximum rate allowed by any applicable state law.
