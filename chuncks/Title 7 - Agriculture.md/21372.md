(b) An individual heir of an estate or beneficiary of a trust may be considered as a separate person to the extent that such heir or beneficiary is engaged in the production of crops as a separate producer and otherwise meets the requirements of § 795.3, except that an estate or irrevocable trust which has a sole heir or beneficiary shall not be considered as a separate person from such heir or beneficiary.

(c) Where an irrevocable trust or an estate is a producer on a farm and one or more of the beneficiaries or heirs of such trust or estate are minor children, the minor children's pro rata share of the program payments to the trust or estate shall be attributed to the parent of the minor children except as otherwise provided in § 795.12.
