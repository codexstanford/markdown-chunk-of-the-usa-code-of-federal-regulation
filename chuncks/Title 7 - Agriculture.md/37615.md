(b) The borrower must agree to prepay all of its outstanding RUS Notes;

(c) The borrower must identify the source of financing that will be used directly or indirectly to refinance its outstanding RUS Notes. The borrower must certify in writing whether such financing will be tax exempt and, if so, shall furnish all information on the financing as RUS may request to enable RUS to adjust the discount to the equivalent to fully taxable financing;

(d) The borrower must have expended all funds advanced on account of the RUS Notes for the purposes for which such funds were advanced or repaid RUS for all unexpended funds;

(e) The borrower must agree to a rescission of the unadvanced balance of any RUS Notes outstanding as of the date of its application for prepayment;

(f) The borrower must agree that the borrower, its successors and assigns, shall pay to the Government, as a condition of receiving additional loans or loan guarantees pursuant to titles I and III of the Act, an amount equal to the aggregate of the difference with respect to each of the RUS Notes between the amount outstanding on the RUS Note and the Discounted Present Value of the RUS Note upon prepayment with interest accruing quarterly; the interest rates shall be the rates provided in the respective Notes; and

(g) If the borrower is a party to a wholesale power contract with a power supplier financed pursuant to the Act, the borrower must provide the Administrator with such assurances as the Administrator may request that it will meet its obligations to the power supplier. The borrower must also specifically agree to the following limitation: The borrower agrees that, for so long as the Wholesale Power Contract shall be in effect between the borrower and the power supplier, the borrower will not, without the approval in writing of the power supplier and the Administrator, take or suffer to be taken any steps for reorganization or to consolidate with or merge into any corporation or any other public power district, or to sell, lease or transfer (or make any agreement therefor) all or a substantial portion of its assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the borrower may take or suffer to be taken any steps for reorganization or to consolidate with or merge into any corporation or any other public power district, or to sell, lease or transfer (or make any agreement therefor) all or a substantial portion of its assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, so long as the borrower shall pay such portion of the outstanding indebtedness evidenced by the power supplier's Notes at the time outstanding as shall be determined by the power supplier with the prior written consent of the Administrator and shall otherwise comply with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Administrator and the Power Supplier shall require.
