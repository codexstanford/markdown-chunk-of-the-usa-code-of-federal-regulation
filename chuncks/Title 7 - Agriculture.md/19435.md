####### § 760.622 Incorrect or false producer production evidence.

(a) If production evidence, including but not limited to acreage and production reports, provided by a participant is false or incorrect, as determined by the FSA county committee at any time after an application for payment is made, the FSA county committee will determine whether:

(1) The participant submitting the production evidence acted in good faith or took action to defeat the purposes of the program, such that the information provided was intentionally false or incorrect.

(2) The same false, incorrect, or unacceptable production evidence was submitted for payment(s) under crop insurance or NAP, and if so, for NAP covered crops, make any NAP program adjustments according to § 1437.15 of this title.

(b) If the FSA county committee determines that the production evidence submitted is false, incorrect, or unacceptable, and the participant who submitted the evidence did not act in good faith or took action to defeat the purposes of the program, the provisions of § 760.109, including a denial of future program benefits, will apply. The Deputy Administrator may take further action, including, but not limited to, making further payment reductions or requiring refunds or taking other legal action.

(c) If the FSA county committee determines that the production evidence is false, incorrect, or unacceptable, but the participant who submitted the evidence acted in good faith, payment may be adjusted and a refund may be required.
