###### § 319.15a Administrative instructions and interpretation relating to entry into Guam of bagasse and related sugarcane products.

Bagasse and related sugarcane products have been so processed that, in the judgment of the Department, their importation into Guam will involve no pest risk, and they may be imported into Guam without further permit, other than the authorization contained in this paragraph. Such importations may be made without the submission of a notice of arrival inasmuch as there is available to the inspector the essential information normally supplied by the importer at the time of importation. Inspection of such importations may be made under the general authority of § 330.105(a) of this chapter. If an importation is found infected, infested, or contaminated with any plant pest and is not subject to disposal under this part, disposition may be made in accordance with § 330.106 of this chapter.
