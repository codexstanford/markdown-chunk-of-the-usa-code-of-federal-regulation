###### § 1710.411 Analytical support documentation.

Applications for loans under this subpart may only be made for eligible activities and investments included in an RUS-approved EE Program.

This documentation must include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following:

(a) A comparison of the utility's projected annual growth in demand after incorporating the EE Program together with an updated baseline forecast on file with RUS, where each includes an estimate of energy consuming devices used by customers in the service territory and a specific time horizon as determined by the utility for meeting the performance objectives established by them for the EE Program;

(b) Demonstration that the required periods of performance under § 1710.405(c) can reasonably be expected to be met;

(c) A report of discussions and coordination conducted with the power supplier, where applicable, issues identified as a result, and the outcome of this effort.

(d) An estimate of the amount of direct investment in utility-owned generation that will be deferred as a result of the EE Program;

(e) A description of efforts to identify state and local sources of funding and, if available, how they are to be integrated in the financing of the EE Program; and

(f) Copies of sample documentation used by the utility in administering its EE Program.

(g) Such other documents and reports as the Administrator may require.
