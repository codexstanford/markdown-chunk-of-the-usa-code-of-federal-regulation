######## Port value.

(t)(1) Where CCC announces coverage on a FAS or FOB basis and:

(i) Where the commodity is sold on a FAS or FOB basis, U.S. point of export, the value, FAS or FOB basis, U.S. point of export, of the export sale, including the upward tolerance, if any, as provided by the export sales contract, reduced by the value of any discounts or allowances granted to the importer in connection with such sale; or

(ii) Where the commodity was sold on a CFR or CIF basis, point of entry, the value of the export sale, FAS or FOB, point of export, including the upward tolerance, if any, as provided by the export sales contract, is measured by the CFR or CIF value of the agricultural commodity less the value of ocean freight and, in the case of CIF sales, less the value of marine and war risk insurance, reduced by the value of any discounts or allowances granted to the importer in connection with the sale of the commodity; or

(2) Where CCC announces coverage on a CFR or CIF basis and where the commodity was sold on CFR or CIF basis, point of entry, the total value of the export sale, CFR or CIF basis, point of entry, including the upward tolerance, if any, as provided by the export sales contract, reduced by the value of any discounts or allowances granted to the importer in connection with the sale of the commodity.

(3) When a CFR or CIF commodity export sale involves the performance of non-freight services to be performed outside the United States (e.g., services such as bagging bulk cargo), which are not normally included in ocean freight contracts, the value of such services and any related materials not exported from the U.S. with the commodity must also be deducted from the CFR or CIF sales price in determining the port value.
