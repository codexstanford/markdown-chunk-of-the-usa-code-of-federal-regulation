(b) The network design must include a description of the proposed technology used to deliver the broadband service, demonstrating that all premises in the PFSA can be offered broadband service; a network diagram, identifying cable routes, wireless access points, and any other equipment required to operate the network; a buildout timeline and milestones for implementation of the project; and a capital investment schedule showing that the system can be built within five years. All of these items must be certified by a professional engineer who is certified in at least one of the states where there is or will be project construction. The certification from the professional engineer must clearly state that the proposed network can deliver the broadband service to all premises in the PFSA at the minimum required service level.
