####### Price Quotations and Differences
######## § 27.96 Quotations in bona fide spot markets.

The price or value and differences between the price or value of grades and staple lengths of cotton shall be based solely upon the official cotton standards of the United States and shall be the actual commercial value or price and differences as determined by the sale of spot cotton in such spot market. Quotations shall be determined and maintained in each designated spot market by the Cotton Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA, as follows:

(a) In spot markets designated to determine differences for the settlement of futures contracts, the Cotton Division will on each business day determine and quote by bale volume the prices or values of base qualities which are deliverable on any active futures contracts, as well as the differences for all other qualities deliverable on such contracts. The prices or differences for non-deliverable qualities will be determined and quoted by bale volume in each such spot market for those qualities normally produced or traded in that particular market.

(b) In spot markets not designated to determine differences for the settlement of futures contracts, the Cotton Division will on each business day determine and quote by bale volume the prices or differences for all qualities of cotton normally produced or traded in each such spot market.
