The contribution amount will be reflected in the award budget.

(i) Expenditures are necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of an approved activity;

(ii) Expenditures are not included as cost share for any other Federal award;

(iv) The contribution or cost share is made during the period covered by the agreement.
