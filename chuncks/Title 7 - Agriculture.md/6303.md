This form of official identification may also be used to determine the final quality grade of carcasses; one stamp equates to "USDA Select" or "USDA Good"; two stamps placed together vertically equates to "USDA Choice"; and three stamps placed together vertically equates to "USDA Prime."

(b) A shield enclosing the letters "USDA," as shown in Figure 2 to paragraph (b) of this section, with the appropriate quality grade designation "Prime," "Choice," "Select," "Good," "Standard," "Commercial," "Utility," "Cutter," "Canner," or "Cull," as provided in the United States Standards for Grades of Carcass Beef, the United States Standards for Grades of Veal and Calf Carcasses, and the United States Standards for Grades of Lamb, Yearling Mutton, and Mutton Carcasses; and accompanied by the class designation "Bullock," "Veal," "Calf," "Lamb," "Yearling Mutton," or "Mutton," constitutes a form of official identification under the regulations to show the quality grade, and where necessary, the class, under said standards, of steer, heifer, and cow beef, veal, calf, lamb, yearling mutton, and mutton.

When yield graded, bull and bullock carcasses will be identified with the class designation "Bull" and "Bullock," respectively. The identification letters assigned to the grader performing the service will appear underneath and outside of the shield.

The identification letters assigned to the grader performing the service will appear underneath and outside of the shield.

(e) Under the regulations, for yield grade identification purposes only, a shield enclosing the letters "US" on one side and "DA" on the other, and with the appropriate yield grade designation number "1," "2," "3," "4," or "5," as shown in Figure 5 to paragraph (e) of this section, constitutes a form of official identification under the regulations to show the yield grade under said standards. The identification letters assigned to the grader performing the service will appear underneath and outside of the shield.
