###### § 1205.402 Determination of Cotton Board membership.

(a) In determining whether any cotton-producing state is entitled to be represented by more than one member of the Cotton Board as provided in § 1205.322, average annual production of Upland cotton in terms of 480-pound net weight bales for the five most recent marketing years will be used as the criteria for determination of such additional members.

(b) In determining whether importers of cotton and cotton-containing products are entitled to be represented by more than a minimum of two members on the Cotton Board as provided in § 1205.322, the average annual volume of imported cotton and the cotton content of imported products on which assessments have been collected will be used as the criteria for determination of such additional members. This volume of cotton will be expressed in terms of 480-pound net weight bales for the five most recent calendar years. The initial importer representation on the Board shall consist of four importer representatives.

(c) All members appointed from a state will be entitled to serve a full three-year term even though it is determined in a subsequent year that a state should have fewer additional members by using the average production of the five most recent marketing years as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) All members appointed to represent importers will be entitled to serve a full three-year term even though it is determined in a subsequent year that importers should be represented by fewer additional members by using the average volume of imports of cotton and the cotton content of products on which assessments have been collected as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

(e) Each year the Director shall:

(1) Based on the average annual production of Upland cotton in terms of 480-pound net weight bales for the five most recent marketing years, notify all certified cotton producer organizations in each cotton-producing state of the number of vacancies to be filled by cotton producers on the Cotton Board; and

(2) Based on the average annual volume of imports of cotton and the cotton content of cotton-containing products on which assessments as provided for in § 1205.335 have been collected in terms of 480-pound net weight bales for the five most recent calendar years, notify all certified cotton importer organizations of the number of vacancies to be filled by cotton importers on the Cotton Board.
