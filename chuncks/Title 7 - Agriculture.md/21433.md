###### Subpart D - Categorical Exclusions
####### § 799.30 Purpose of categorical exclusion process.

(a) FSA has determined that the categories of proposed actions listed in §§ 799.31 and 799.32 do not normally individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and do not threaten a violation of applicable statutory, regulatory, or permit requirements for environment, safety, and health, including requirements of Executive Orders and other USDA regulations in this chapter. Based on FSA's previous experience implementing these actions and similar actions through the completion of EAs, these proposed actions are categorically excluded.

(b) If a proposed action falls within one of the categories of proposed actions listed in § 1b.3 of this title, § 799.31, or § 799.32, and there are no extraordinary circumstances present as specified in § 799.33, then the proposed action is categorically excluded from the requirements to prepare an EA or an EIS.

(c) Those proposed actions in categories in § 799.31 or § 799.32 will be considered categorical exclusions unless it is determined there are extraordinary circumstances, as specified in § 799.33.
