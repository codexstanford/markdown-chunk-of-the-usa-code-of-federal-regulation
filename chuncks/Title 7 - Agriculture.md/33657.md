An analysis of purchased power options, including an analysis of available alternate sources of power shall be included. The analysis should include the terms and conditions of any requests for proposals and responses to such requests.

(c) Generally, studies of self-generation, load management, and energy conservation options shall include, as appropriate, analyses of:

(1) Capital and operating costs;

(2) Financing requirements and risks;

(3) System reliability;

(4) Alternative unit sizes;

(5) Alternative types of generation;

(6) Fuel alternatives;

(7) System stability;

(8) Load flows; and
