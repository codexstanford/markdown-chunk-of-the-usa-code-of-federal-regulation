(b) The Deputy Administrator may take such actions as needed to avoid a duplication of benefits under the programs provided for in this part, or duplication of benefits received in other programs, and may impose such cross-program payment limitations as may be consistent with the intent of this part in order to help prevent a person or legal entity being paid more than the total value of their loss.

Specifically, a person or legal entity with an AGI that exceeds $900,000 will not be eligible to receive benefits under this part.

(d) The direct attribution provisions in part 1400 of this chapter apply to ELAP, LFP, LIP, and TAP.
