(ii) The quantity of production of the agricultural commodity produced by the group during such marketing year is less than 85 percent of the average of the quantity of production of the commodity produced by the group in the 3 marketing years preceding such marketing year; or

(iii) The value of production of the agricultural commodity produced by the group during such marketing year is less than 85 percent of the average value of production of the commodity produced by the group in the 3 marketing years preceding such marketing year; or

(iv) The cash receipts for the agricultural commodity produced by the group during such marketing year are less than 85 percent of the average of the cash receipts for the commodity produced by the group in the 3 marketing years preceding such marketing year;

(2) The volume of imports of articles like or directly competitive with the agricultural commodity produced by the group in the marketing year with respect to which the group files the petition increased compared to the average volume of such imports during the 3 marketing years preceding such marketing year; and

(3) The increase in such imports contributed importantly to the decrease in the national average price, or quantity of production, or value of production, or cash receipts for, the agricultural commodity.

(b) In any case in which there are separate classes of goods within an agricultural commodity, the Administrator (FAS) shall treat each class as a separate commodity in determining:

(1) Group eligibility;

(2) The national average price, or quantity of production, or value of production, or cash receipts; and

(3) The volume of imports.

(c) Upon making a determination, whether affirmative or negative, the Administrator (FAS) shall promptly publish in thea summary of the determination, together with the reasons for making the determination.

(d) In addition, the Administrator (FAS) shall notify producers covered by a certification how to apply for adjustment assistance. Notification methods may include direct mailings to known producers, messages to directly affected producer groups and organizations, electronic communications, Web site notices on the Internet, use of broadcast print media, and transmittal through local USDA offices.

(e) Whenever a group of agricultural producers is certified as eligible to apply for assistance, the Administrator (FAS) shall notify NIFA, the Agricultural Marketing Service, and FSA who will assist in informing other producers about the TAA for Farmers program and how they may apply for trade adjustment assistance.
