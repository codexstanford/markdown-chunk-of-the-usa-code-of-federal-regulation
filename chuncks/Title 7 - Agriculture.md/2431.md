## Subtitle A - Office of the Secretary of Agriculture
### PART 15f - ADJUDICATIONS UNDER SECTION 741
#### Subpart B - I Filed a Complaint With USDA Prior to July 1, 1997, How Do I Request That USDA Consider My Complaint Using These Procedures?
##### § 15f.7 May I be represented by an attorney?

(a) If your Section 741 Complaint Request is automatically docketed as set forth in § 15f.5(a), and you already are represented by counsel of whom you have notified USDA, then this section does not apply.

(b) If you are filing your Section 741 Complaint Request with USDA, and if you are represented by an attorney, your Section 741 Complaint Request should also include an authorization signed by you indicating that the attorney is entitled to represent you on your behalf. If USDA receives such an authorization, all documents in connection with consideration of your complaint under these procedures will be sent to your attorney and not to you.

(c) Once your Section 741 Complaint Request is docketed with USDA, and you afterwards retain an attorney, you should forward an authorization to USDA signed by you indicating that the attorney is entitled to represent you on your behalf. If USDA receives such an authorization, all documents in connection with consideration of your complaint under these procedures will be sent to your attorney and not to you.
