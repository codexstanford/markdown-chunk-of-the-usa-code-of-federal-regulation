####### § 1944.652 Policy.

(a) The policy of RHS is to provide HPG's to grantees to operate a program which finances repair and rehabilitation activities to individual housing, rental properties, or co-ops for very low- and low-income persons. Individual housing that is owner occupied may qualify for replacement housing when it is determined by the grantee that the housing is not economically feasible for repair or rehabilitation. Grantees are expected to:

(1) Coordinate and leverage funding for repair and rehabilitation activities, as well as replacement housing, with housing and community development organizations or activities operating in the same geographic area; and

(2) Focus the program on rural areas and smaller communities so that it serves very low and low-income persons.

(b) RHS intends to permit grantees considerable latitude in program design and administration. The forms or types of assistance must provide the greatest long-term benefit to the greatest number of persons residing in individual housing, rental properties, or co-ops needing repair and rehabilitation or replacement of individual housing.

(c) Repairs and rehabilitation or replacement activities affecting properties on or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places will be accomplished in a manner that supports national historic preservation objectives as specified in § 1944.673.
