Section 810 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1979, as amended, authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to pay for acquired Rural Development single family residential properties sold through the HUD-UH Program. Local governmental units may make application through HUD to participate in the UH Program. State Directors will be notified by the Assistant Administrator for Housing, when local governmental units in their States have obtained funding for the UH Program. The notification will provide specific guidance in accordance with the "Memorandum of Agreement between the Rural Development and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development" dated October 2, 1981. (See Exhibit C of this subpart.) A Local Urban Homesteading Agency (LUHA) is authorized a 10 percent discount of the listed price on any SFH nonprogram property for the UH Program. No discount is authorized on program property.
