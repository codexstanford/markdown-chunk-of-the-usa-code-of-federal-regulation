If delivery is made within the coverage of the bank obligation(s) submitted in accordance with § 1488.8, CCC will look to the obligating bank or banks and the foreign importer, rather than to the exporter or intervening purchaser, for payment of all amounts due at maturity of the account receivable and of the bank obligation(s), but the exporter and the intervening purchaser shall remain liable for any loss arising from breach of any contractual obligation, certification or warranty made by them pursuant to the financing agreement, and the exporter shall remain liable for any amounts not covered by the bank obligation which are owing to CCC, and any remittance or refund required by § 1488.15 and § 1488.18, together with interest thereon at the rate specified in the documents evidencing the account receivable, as well as for any liquidated damages provided for in § 1488.11.
