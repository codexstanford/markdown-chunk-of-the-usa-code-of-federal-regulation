(k) The provisions of parts 1400, 1403 and 1404 of this chapter apply to NAP.

(l) In the case of death, incompetence or disappearance of any person who is eligible to receive payments under this part, such payments will be disbursed in accordance with part 707 of this title.

(m) Any person or legal entity who has a debt from nonpayment of the premium for coverage levels specified in § 1437.5(c) will be ineligible for assistance under any subsequent crop year NAP coverage on any crop from the crop year of nonpayment of premium until the debt is paid in full.

(1) If a person or legal entity is ineligible for NAP assistance due to the debt because of the nonpayment of premium, FSA will permit the person or legal entity to file an application for coverage together with payment of any service fees; however, that application and payment of service fees will not make the person or legal entity eligible for any assistance until the premium debt is paid in full.

(2) Service fees paid with applications for coverage that are filed by persons or legal entities who are ineligible for NAP assistance as specified in paragraph (m) of this section will not be credited to any unpaid premium debt nor are they refundable.

(n) A person or legal entity ineligible for NAP assistance under paragraph (m) of this section may become eligible for future NAP assistance if they remit all unpaid debt related to the nonpayment of premium before the application for payment filing deadline (see § 1437.11(g)).

(o) Any NAP payment that was not issued for a prior NAP crop year due to an outstanding debt as specified in paragraph (m) of this section will not be issued.

(p) Unpaid debt related to the failure to pay any premium satisfied by administrative offset will reinstate the eligibility of a person or legal entity from the date the offset satisfies all the unpaid premium debt with interest.
