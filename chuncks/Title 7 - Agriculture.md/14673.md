###### § 281.7 Indian tribal organization failure.

When Performance Reporting System reviews indicate that continuing deficiencies exist and corrective action proposals (including training and technical assistance to overcome these deficiencies), and/or appropriate sanctions have not, in the opinion of FNS, resulted in a sufficient degree of improvement, FNS will conduct a review to determine if the ITO has failed to properly administer SNAP. FNS shall examine the relevant factors specified in § 281.3(b)(1) and shall follow the notification and determination procedures set forth in § 281.3 (c) and (d). If ITO failure is determined, FNS shall require the appropriate agency of the State government to resume administration of the Program on the reservation in accordance with an approved termination and transition arrangement.
