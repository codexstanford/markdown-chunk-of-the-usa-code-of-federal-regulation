####### § 930.57 Secondary inventory reserve.

(a) In the event the inventory reserve established under § 930.55 of this part is at its maximum volume, and the Board has announced, in accordance with § 930.50, that volume regulation will be necessary to maintain an orderly supply of quality cherries for the market, handlers in a regulated district may elect to place in a secondary inventory reserve all or a portion of the cherries the volume regulation would otherwise require them to divert in accordance with § 930.59.

(b) Should any handler in a regulated district exercise his or her right to establish a secondary inventory reserve under paragraph (a) of this section, all costs of maintaining that reserve, as well as inspection costs, will be the responsibility of the individual handler.

(c) The secondary inventory reserve shall be established in accordance with §§ 930.55 (b) and (c) and such other rules and regulations which the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish.

(d) The Board shall retain control over the release of any cherries from the secondary inventory reserve. No cherries may be released from the secondary reserve until all cherries in any primary inventory reserve established under § 930.55 have been released. Any release of the secondary inventory reserve shall be in accordance with the annual marketing policy and with § 930.54.
