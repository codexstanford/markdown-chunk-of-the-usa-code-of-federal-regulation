####### § 945.23 Redistricting and reapportionment.

(a) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may reestablish districts within the production area, may reapportion committee membership among the various districts, may increase the number of producer and/or handler members and alternates on the committee, and may change the composition of the committee by changing the ratio between producer and handler members, including their alternates. At least every six years, the committee shall review committee size, composition and representation and recommend to the Secretary whether changes should be made. In recommending any such changes, the committee shall give consideration to:

(1) Shifts in potato acreage within districts and within the production area during recent years;

(2) the importance of new potato production in its relation to existing districts;

(3) the equitable relationship between committee membership and districts;

(4) economies to result for producers in promoting efficient administration due to redistricting or reapportionment of members within districts; and

(5) other relevant factors.

(b) Membership of the committee shall be apportioned among the districts of the production area so as to provide the following representation or such other representation as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary:

(1) Three producer members, including at least one who predominately produces seed potatoes, and one handler member, with their respective alternates, from District No. 1;

(2) One producer member and one handler member, with their respective alternates, from District No. 2; and

(3) One producer member and one handler member, with their respective alternates, from District No. 3.
