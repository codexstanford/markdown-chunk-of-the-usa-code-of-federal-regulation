(a) No loan guaranteed by the Agency under this subpart will be conditioned on any requirement that the recipient(s) of such assistance accept or receive electric service from any particular utility, supplier, or cooperative.

(b) No loan guaranteed by the Agency may be made with the proceeds of any obligation the Interest on which is excludable from income under 26 U.S.C. 103 or a successor statute.
