(b) If an Applicant demonstrates that it would be cost prohibitive to meet the broadband lending speed in paragraph (a) of this section in the proposed funded service area due to the unique characteristics of the service territory, the Administrator may agree to utilize substitute service standards. In such cases, Applicants must document in their application why the unique characteristics of such an area make it cost prohibitive to provide service at the broadband lending speed. Note that the proof of burden on Applicants will be extremely high.
