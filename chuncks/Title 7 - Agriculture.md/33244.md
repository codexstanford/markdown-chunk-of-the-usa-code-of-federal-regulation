(2) The continuation of the assistance provided under the agreement is no longer necessary or desirable; or

(3) Storage facilities are inadequate to prevent spoilage or waste, or distribution of the donated commodities or procured commodities will result in substantial disincentive to, or interference with, domestic production or marketing in the target country.

(b) If an agreement is terminated, the recipient:

(1) Is responsible for the security and integrity of any undistributed donated commodities or procured commodities and must dispose of such commodities only as agreed to by FAS;

(2) Is responsible for any sale proceeds, FAS-provided funds, interest, or program income that have not been disbursed and must use or return them only as agreed to by FAS; and

(3) Must comply with any closeout and post-closeout procedures specified in the agreement and 2 CFR 200.343 and 200.344.
