###### Lender Functions and Responsibilities
####### § 4279.214 General functions and responsibilities.

(a) The Lender has the primary responsibility for loan origination and servicing. Any action or inaction on the part of the Agency does not relieve the Lender of its responsibilities to originate and service the loan guaranteed under this subpart.

The Lender is ultimately responsible for underwriting, loan origination, loan servicing, and compliance with all Agency regulations.

(b) Agents and Persons are prohibited from acting as both Loan Packager and Loan Service Provider on the same guaranteed loan.

(c) All Lenders obtaining or requesting a Program loan guarantee are responsible for:

(1) Processing applications for guaranteed loans. The Lender is responsible for submitting a complete application for each guaranteed loan requested;

(2) Developing and maintaining adequately documented loan files, which must be maintained for at least 3 years after the final loss has been paid;

(3) Recommending only loan proposals that are eligible and financially feasible;
