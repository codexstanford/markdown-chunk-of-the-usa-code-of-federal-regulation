###### § 1740.25 Substantially Underserved Trust Areas (SUTA).

Applicants seeking assistance may request consideration under the SUTA provisions in 7 U.S.C. 936f.

(a) If the Administrator determines that a community within "trust land" (as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3765) has a high need for the benefits of the Program, the Administrator may designate the community as a "substantially underserved trust area" (as defined in section 306F of the RE Act).

(b) To receive consideration under SUTA, the applicant must submit to the Agency a completed application that includes all information requested in 7 CFR part 1700, subpart D. In addition, the application must identify the discretionary authorities within subpart D that it seeks to have applied to its application. Note, however, the following:

(1) Given the prohibition on funding operating expenses in the Program, requests for waiver of the equity requirements cannot be considered; and

(2) Due to the statutory requirements that established the Program, waiver of the nonduplication requirements cannot be considered.
