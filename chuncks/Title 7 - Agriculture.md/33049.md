#### PART 1530 - THE REFINED SUGAR RE-EXPORT PROGRAM, THE SUGAR CONTAINING PRODUCTS RE-EXPORT PROGRAM, AND THE POLYHYDRIC ALCOHOL PROGRAM
##### § 1530.106 License charges and credits.

(a) A license shall be charged or credited for the quantity of sugar entered, transferred, exported, or used, adjusted to a dry weight basis. Refiner quantities shall be adjusted to raw value, using the formulas set forth in paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section. Manufacturer and producer quantities shall be adjusted to 100 degrees polarity on a dry weight basis.

(1) To adjust the raw value for sugar with a polarization of less than 92 degrees, divide the total sugar content by 0.972 (polarization x outturn weight/.972).

(2) To adjust the raw value for sugar with polarization of 92 degrees or above, multiply the polarization times 0.0175, subtract 0.68, and multiply the difference by the outturn weight (((polarization x 0.0175)-0.68) x outturn weight).

(3) To determine the quantity of refined sugar that must be transferred or exported to equal a corresponding quantity of entered raw sugar charged to a license, divide the quantity of entered raw sugar by 1.07 (raw quantity/1.07).

(b) [Reserved]
