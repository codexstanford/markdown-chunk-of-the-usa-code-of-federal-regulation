(b) A minor shall be considered to be the same owner or operator as the parent, court-appointed guardian, or other person responsible for the minor child, unless the parent or guardian has no interest in the minor's farm or production from the farm, and the minor:

(3) Personally carries out the farming activities; and

(4) Maintains a separate accounting for the farming operation.

(c) A minor shall not be considered to be the same owner or operator as the parent or court-appointed guardian if the minor's interest in the farming operation results from being the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust and ownership of the property is vested in the trust or the minor.

(d) A life estate tenant shall be considered to be the owner of the property for their life.

(e) A trust shall be considered to be an owner with the beneficiary of the trust; except a trust can be considered a separate owner or operator from the beneficiary, if the trust:

(3) Maintains funds and accounts separate from that of any other individual or entity for the interest.
