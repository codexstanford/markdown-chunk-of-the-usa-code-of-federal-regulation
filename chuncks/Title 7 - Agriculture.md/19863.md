(1) Presidential Emergency Disaster Declaration authorizing public assistance for categories C through G or individual assistance due to a qualifying disaster event occurring in the 2018 or 2019 calendar years; or

(2) Secretarial Disaster Designation for a qualifying disaster event occurring in the 2018 or 2019 calendar years.
