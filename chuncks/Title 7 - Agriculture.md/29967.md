####### § 1412.87 Transfer of land and succession-in-interest.

(a) A succession in interest application for CTAP is required if there has been a change in the producer shares of upland cotton base acres in § 1412.82(a) for 2014 or 2015, as applicable, due to:

(1) A sale of land;

(2) A change of producer, including a change in a partnership that increases or decreases the number of partners or changes who are partners;

(3) A foreclosure, bankruptcy, or involuntary loss of the farm;

(4) A change in producer shares to reflect changes in the producer's share of the upland cotton base acres relevant to the originally approved application; or

(5) Any other change determined by the Deputy Administrator to be a succession that will not adversely affect or defeat the purpose of CTAP.

(b) A succession in interest to the CTAP application is not permitted if CCC determines that the change:

(1) Results in a violation of the landlord-tenant provisions specified in § 1412.55; or

(2) Adversely affects or otherwise defeats the purpose of CTAP.

(c) If a producer who is entitled to receive CTAP payments dies, becomes incompetent, or is otherwise unable to receive the payment, CCC will make the payment in accordance with part 707 of this title.

(d) A producer or owner of an enrolled farm is required to inform the county committee of changes in interest in base acres of upland cotton as specified in § 1412.82(b) on the farm not later than:

(1) August 1 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if the change requires a reconstitution be completed in accordance with part 718 of this title; or

(2) September 30 of the fiscal year in which the change occurs if the change does not require a reconstitution be completed in accordance with part 718 of this title.

(e) In any case in which a CTAP payment has previously been made to a predecessor, such payment will not be paid to the successor, unless such payment has been refunded in full by the predecessor.
