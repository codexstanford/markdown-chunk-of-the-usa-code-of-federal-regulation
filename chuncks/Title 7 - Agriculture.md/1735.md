In either applying for or participating in PARP, or both, the producer is subject to laws against perjury and any resulting penalties and prosecution, including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1621. If the producer willfully makes and represents as true any verbal or written declaration, certification, statement, or verification that the producer knows or believes not to be true, in the course of either applying for or participating in PARP, or both, then the producer may be guilty of perjury and, except as otherwise provided by law, may be fined, imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both, regardless of whether the producer makes such verbal or written declaration, certification, statement, or verification within or without the United States.
