###### § 625.11 Easement participation requirements.

(a) To enroll land in HFRP through a permanent easement, an easement for the maximum duration allowed under State law, or 30-year enrollment option, a landowner will grant an easement to the United States. An Indian Tribe may enroll in HFRP through a 10-year cost-share agreement as specified in § 625.9, a 30-year contract as specified in § 625.12, or a permanent easement as specified in this part. The easement deed will require that the easement area be maintained in accordance with HFRP goals and objectives for the duration of the term of the easement, including the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of habitat and forest ecosystem functions and values.

(b) For the duration of its term, the easement will require, at a minimum, that the landowner and the landowner's heirs, successors, and assignees, will cooperate in the restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of the land in accordance with the easement and with the terms of the HFRP restoration plan. In addition, the easement will grant to the United States, through NRCS:

(1) A right of access to the easement area by NRCS or its representative;

(2) The right to determine and permit compatible uses on the easement area and specify the amount, method, timing, intensity, and duration of the compatible use, if such use is consistent with the long-term protection and enhancement of the purposes for which the easement was established;

(3) The rights, title, and interest to the easement area as specified in the conservation easement deed; and

(4) The right to perform restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management activities on the easement area.

(c) The landowner will convey title to the easement which is acceptable to NRCS. The landowner will warrant that the easement granted to the United States is superior to the rights of all others, except for exceptions to the title which are deemed acceptable by NRCS.

(d) The landowner will:

(1) Comply with the terms of the easement;

(2) Comply with all terms and conditions of any associated agreement or contract;

(3) Agree to the long-term restoration, protection, enhancement, maintenance, and management of the easement in accordance with the terms of the easement and related agreements;

(4) Have the option to enter into an agreement with governmental or private organizations to assist in carrying out any landowner responsibilities on the easement area; and

(5) Agree that each person who is subject to the easement will be jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the easement and the provisions of this part, and for any refunds or payment adjustment which may be required for violation of any terms or conditions of the easement or the provisions of this part.
