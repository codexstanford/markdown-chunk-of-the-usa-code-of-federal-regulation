####### § 760.1609 Qualifying disaster events.

(a) The On-Farm Storage Loss Program will provide a payment to eligible producers who suffered losses of harvested commodities while such commodities were stored in on farm structures as a result from hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, typhoons, volcanic activity, snowstorms, and wildfires that occurred in the 2018 and 2019 calendar years.

(b) For a loss due to or related to an event specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the loss must have occurred on acreage that was physically located in a county that received a:

(1) Presidential Emergency Disaster Declaration authorizing public assistance for categories C through G or individual assistance due to a hurricane occurring in the 2018 or 2019 calendar year; or

(2) Secretarial Disaster Designation for a hurricane occurring in the 2018 or 2019 calendar year.

(c) A producer with a loss not located in a physical location county that was eligible under paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be eligible for a program payment for losses due to hurricane and related conditions only if the producer provides supporting documentation that is acceptable to FSA from which the FSA county committee determines that the loss of the commodity was reasonably related to a qualifying disaster event as specified in this subpart and meets all other eligibility conditions. Supporting documentation may include furnishing climatological data from a reputable source or other information substantiating the claim of loss due to a qualifying disaster event.

(d) For a loss due to wildfires and conditions related to wildfire in the 2018 or 2019 calendar year, all counties where wildfires occurred, as determined by FSA county committees, are eligible program payments; a Presidential Emergency Disaster Declaration or Secretarial Disaster Designation for wildfire is not required. The loss must be reasonably related to wildfire and conditions related to wildfire, as specified in this subpart's definition of qualifying disaster event.

(e) For a loss due to floods, tornadoes, typhoons, volcanic activity, snowstorms or any other directly related weather disaster event, the loss must be reasonably related to the disaster event as specified in this subpart's definition of qualifying disaster event.
