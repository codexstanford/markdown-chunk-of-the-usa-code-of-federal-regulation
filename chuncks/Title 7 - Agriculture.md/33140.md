##### § 1580.503 Recovery of overpayments.

(a) If the Administrator (FAS) determines that any producer has received any payment under this program to which the producer was not entitled, or has expended funds received under this program for purpose that was not approved by the Administrator (FAS) such producer will be liable to repay such amount. The Administrator (FAS) may waive such repayment if it is determined that:

(1) The payment was made without fault on the part of the producer; and

(2) Requiring such repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience.

(b) Unless an overpayment is otherwise recovered, or waived under paragraph (a) of this section, the Administrator (FAS), shall recover the overpayment as a debt following the procedures in 7 CFR part 3. The requirement for demand and notice and opportunity for a hearing under the debt collection procedures in 7 CFR part 3 shall satisfy the notice and hearing requirements under 19 U.S.C. 2401f(c), and the appeal procedures in § 1580.505 of this part shall not apply to collection of overpayments
