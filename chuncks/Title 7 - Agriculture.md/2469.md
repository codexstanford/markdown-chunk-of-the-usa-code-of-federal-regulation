#### Subpart F - How Do I Count Days for Purposes of Deadlines and What Happens if I Miss a Deadline in These Rules?
##### § 15f.28 When I or someone else has to do something within a certain number of days, how will USDA or the ALJ count the days?

Unless otherwise specifically noted, a "day" refers to a calendar day and a document that must be filed by a certain date must either be postmarked on that date or received by the Docketing Clerk on that date. For documents that must be or are "filed" under these regulations, you count the number of days after filing starting with the day after the filing date as day one. For other time periods, you calculate the time period by counting the day after receipt by the party as day one. If the last day of a time period expires on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the last day of the time period will expire on the next business day.
