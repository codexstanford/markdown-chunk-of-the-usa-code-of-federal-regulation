For each RFA, NIFA may develop and include the appropriate project types and focus areas based on the critical needs identified through stakeholder input and deemed appropriate by NIFA.

(a) In addition, priority in funding shall be given to eligible entities working in partnerships to:

(1) Improve information-sharing capacity;

(2) Maximize the ability to meet the requirements of the RFA; and

(3) To address the following two RTP goals:

(i) To increase the number of students encouraged to pursue and complete a 2-year postsecondary degree, or a certificate of completion, within an occupational focus of this grant program; and

(ii) To assist rural communities by helping students achieve their career goals to develop a viable workforce for bioenergy, pulp and paper manufacturing, or agriculture-based renewable energy.

(b) Applicants may submit applications for one of the three project types:

(1) Regular project proposal (the applicant executes the project without the requirement of sharing grant funds with other project partners);

(2) Joint project proposal (the applicant executes the project with assistance from at least one additional partner and must share grant funds with the additional partner(s)); and

(3) Conference/planning grant to facilitate strategic planning session(s).
