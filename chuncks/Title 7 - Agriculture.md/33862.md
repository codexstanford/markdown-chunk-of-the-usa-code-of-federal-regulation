###### § 1717.616 Sale, lease, or transfer of capital assets.

(a) The term "disposition" in this part shall mean any sale, lease, or any other transaction in which the borrower transfers an interest in a capital asset to another entity or person.

(b) A borrower may, without the prior approval of RUS, sell, lease, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any capital asset if the following conditions are met:

(1) The borrower is not in default on any of its obligations to RUS;

(2) In the most recent year for which data is available, the borrower has met its coverage ratios as set forth in 7 CFR 1710.114(b) or other financial requirements as established by their mortgages, loan contracts, or other security agreements;

(3) The sale, lease, transfer, or disposition of assets will not reduce the borrower's existing or future requirements for energy or capacity being furnished to the borrower under any wholesale power contract which has been pledged as security to the government;

(4) Fair market value is obtained for the assets;

(5) No employee or board member of the organization has a direct personal financial interest in the disposition of the capital assets;

(6) The aggregate value of assets sold, leased, transferred, or disposed of in any 12-month period is less than 10 percent of the borrower's net utility plant prior to the disposition, not to exceed $10,000,000.00; and

(7) If the disposition of the capital asset:

(i) Results in the borrower not retaining an interest in the asset; or

(ii) Constitutes a "capital lease" under 7 CFR 1767.15(s)(1) and the borrower does not retain the right to utilize the asset during the term of the lease, and the borrower disposes of the proceeds, less ordinary and reasonable expenses incident to such disposition, in a manner consistent with paragraph (e) of this section.

(c) The requirements for all dispositions include:

(1) The borrower shall receive fair market value for the disposition of capital assets;

(2) The sale shall be in the best interests of the creditors;

(3) All approvals required by law, by the articles of incorporation, by the bylaws of the seller, or by all the creditors, shall be obtained prior to delivery of the assets;

(4) In the case of dispositions involving exchanges or trades of a plant in place between an RUS borrower and a non-RUS borrower, the borrower must provide evidence, satisfactory to RUS, that the exchange or trade is equitable to the RUS borrower and that the plant acquired in the exchange or trade can be economically integrated into the borrower's system; and

(5) Unless the seller, as an existing RUS borrower is dissolved, its electric system after the disposition will constitute a satisfactory operating unit and the disposition of the asset will not jeopardize the repayment of the seller's RUS loan and other loans or impair the collateral serving as security for all RUS loans. If the purchaser is a RUS borrower, the same determinations shall also be made with respect to the purchaser's operations and loan repayment.

(d) The methods of handling disposition include:

(1) Dispositions of capital assets generally shall be for cash except as otherwise approved by RUS in writing.

(2) If the disposition of the assets is not subject to RUS approval as provided in paragraph (b) of this section but the purchaser requires the government to release its lien on the assets subject to the disposition, the following shall apply:

(i) The borrower shall prepare either:

(A) A transmittal letter to RUS requesting a partial release of the lien with respect to the assets to be disposed; or

(B) RUS Form 369, Request for Approval to Sell Capital Assets, or its successor.

(ii) The partial release of lien should be prepared by the attorney for the borrower or the purchaser. It is the borrower's responsibility to assure the accuracy and legal effectiveness of a proposed release. When a partial release of lien requires execution and acknowledgement by a creditor, such execution and acknowledgment by the other creditor should be obtained by the borrower.

(iii) If the borrower elects to submit a transmittal letter to request the release of lien, the letter should contain the following information:

(A) Insert address of property or assets being sold;

(B) Name and address of purchaser;

(C) Approximate original cost or book value;

(D) The consideration the borrower is receiving in exchange for the disposition of the assets' prices;

(E) A statement that the borrower received fair market value for the property being disposed;

(F) A statement from the borrower that the net proceeds have been or will be deposited into the Construction Fund Trustee Account or will be applied as a prepayment on all debt secured under the mortgage or other security agreement applicable to the assets being disposed, equally and proportionally,

(iv) A statement from the borrower's manager stating that there was no distribution of funds to any employees and/or board members. If any amount of funds arising from the disposition have been distributed to employees and/or board members, specific identification of the employees and/or board members, and reasons why funds were provided to those persons (if applicable) must be stated in the transmittal letter. Include borrower contact information, including email address, for questions.

(v) A statement of how or if the disposition will affect the borrower's existing customers.

(3) If the disposition does not fall within the ambit of paragraph (b) of this section so that RUS Approval is required, the following then apply:

(i) If the Federal Government is the sole lien holder of the borrower's capital assets, approval of the disposition by the Federal Government will be indicated on RUS Form 369, when returned to the seller.

(ii) If the Federal Government holds a lien jointly with supplemental lenders, joint approval for the disposition will be necessary and the borrower will forward the following:

(A) Information should be forwarded directly to RUS and one copy to all supplemental lenders;

(B) When approved by RUS, the information will be forwarded by RUS to the supplemental lenders (and a notice letter advising that RUS has forwarded this information to supplemental lenders will be issued by RUS to the borrower); and

(C) The supplemental lenders will be instructed, in the RUS transmittal memorandum, to execute the documents and return them to the seller. The supplemental lenders will also be instructed to notify RUS when the completed documents are returned to the seller.

(e) The disposition of proceeds will be handled as follows:

(1) The disposition of proceeds from the disposition of a capital asset shall be the same regardless of whether or not RUS approval of the sale is required.

(2) If the gross proceeds from the disposition of the assets total less than $50,000 the borrower shall deposit the proceeds in its general fund account and are to be used for purposes related to the utility business as determined by the management of the borrower.

(3) Proceeds from individual dispositions of property where the gross proceeds total $50,000 or more, should be distributed and accounted for as follows:

(i) Deposited into the Construction Fund Trustee Account. When funds are deposited into the Construction Fund Trustee Account, the borrower shall notify RUS in writing so that the budget records can be adjusted. The funds are to be used for the construction or acquisition of the borrower's utility system;

(ii) Paid to RUS and any secured supplemental lenders if the borrower has concurrent loans outstanding, by application of such funds as a prepayment on the notes of all lenders pro-rata according to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the notes then outstanding, as designated by the noteholders, and in accordance with the borrower's loan documents;

(iii) If the borrower has no concurrent supplemental loans outstanding, applied to RUS as a payment to be applied to the note or notes issued with respect to loans made or guaranteed by RUS, or any portion of a note with respect to a loan made by RUS, and designated by the borrower or RUS; or

(iv) In the case of dispositions of SOallowances, the funds from the sale of allowances should be deposited into the Construction Fund Trustee Account. If any entity prefers to deposit the funds into the General Fund Account, specific RUS approval will be given on a case-by-case basis. Accompanying any request for approval to deposit the funds into the General Fund Account should be a completed RUS Form 369 along with a summary of the anticipated disposition of funds from the General Fund Account;

(v) In the case of dispositions of equipment, materials, or scrap, all proceeds (regardless of the amount) from the sale should be deposited into the General Fund Account to be used for the purchase of other property useful in the mortgagor's utility business, not necessarily of the same kind as the property disposed, which is subject to the lien of the mortgage;

(vi) The Administrator may allow a borrower to deposit the proceeds of the disposition of the asset directly into the General Funds Account instead of the Construction Fund Trustee Account if the borrower has no `Balance in Reserve' on its most recent loan advances 605 report and does not anticipate submitting any new loan applications to RUS. The borrower must receive written approval from RUS before it deposits any proceeds into its General Funds Account.

(f) The borrower must provide the following to RUS for any disposition of a capital asset that does not fall within the scope of paragraph (b) of this section and requires RUS approval:

(1) RUS Form 369 with original signature;

(2) If the disposition involves a condemnation, the borrower must attach a copy of the petition or complaint in the condemnation suit to the RUS Form 369. Items 10, 11, and 12 of the RUS Form 369 may be completed by referring to the attachment. Item 14 need not be completed. The RUS Form 369 and a copy of the petition or complaint in condemnation cases should be submitted to RUS promptly after the petition or complaint has been received by the borrower;

(3) If the purchaser will require the disposition of the asset be free and clear of liens, the partial release of the lien should be prepared by the attorney for the seller or purchaser. It will be the responsibility of the borrower and the borrower's attorney to ensure the accuracy and legal effectiveness of a proposed partial release of the lien;

(4) If the disposition involves real estate or plant in place, in addition to the information required for all dispositions, the seller will provide a brief description of the property being disposed and a statement explaining why the asset is no longer needed for the borrower's system. The borrower shall also provide the following information to RUS for the disposition of real estate and plant in place:

(i) Except in condemnation cases, a statement of agreement between the seller and the purchaser on the proposed selling price. When applicable, include adjustments such as capital additions and retirements, depreciation, taxes, distribution of membership fees, deposits and contributions, prepaid and delinquent bills and accounts, insurance, assignment of easements, the proposed closing date, and other pertinent information. Generally, the closing date selected should not be less than 90 days after the date the required information is forwarded to RUS;

(ii) A complete legal description or real property supported by key and detail maps showing the location of lines or other capital assets to be disposed;

(iii) A breakdown of consumers by classification showing number, mileage, average kWh usage, and revenues for the portion of lines being disposed;

(iv) An inventory of lines on a priced assembly or record unit basis, or, in the case of facilities other than lines, a detailed breakdown of separable units and their costs;

(v) Description and estimated costs of changes, if any, which must be made in the seller's system in order to maintain satisfactory operations after the sale has been completed;

(vi) Other pertinent data such as the physical condition of the property to be disposed, a copy of the lease if facilities to be disposed of are on leased land, and the approval of applicable regulatory bodies where required;

(vii) The retail rates to be applied to the consumers on the lines being disposed (comparative rate schedules); and

(viii) If the purchaser is another RUS borrower or a borrower from a supplemental lender, a description and the estimated costs of the changes, if any, necessary to integrate the properties being acquired with the purchaser's existing system for satisfactory operations.

(5) If the purchaser is to pay the seller in installments, such information should be noted on Item 9 of the RUS Form 369. A sales agreement between the seller and the purchaser, a note or other debt instrument in favor of the seller, and a security agreement in favor of the seller should be executed and collaterally assigned by the seller to the U.S. Government and the supplemental lenders, if applicable. The partial release of the lien will not be executed by RUS, if applicable, until the final installment payment has been received by the seller. The disposition of the proceeds from installment sales will be the same as from cash dispositions);

(6) Dispositions involving exchanges or trades of real estate or plant in place between a borrower and a non-RUS borrower will be considered on an individual case-by-case basis.

(g) Expenditures by the seller in conjunction with the dispositions of capital assets will be properly accounted for and all associated documents shall be retained for review when RUS conducts its next Loan Fund and Accounting Review.
