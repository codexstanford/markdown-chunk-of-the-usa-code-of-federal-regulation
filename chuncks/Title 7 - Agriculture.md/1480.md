(b)The Administrator shall make a report to the Secretary upon the completion of each investigation made by him pursuant to § 6.4(b). The report shall summarize the information disclosed by the investigation, including the points listed in § 6.4(b) which were considered in reaching the recommendation, and shall contain the recommendations of the Administrator as to whether or not emergency treatment is required. If emergency treatment is recommended, the report shall discuss the condition which requires emergency treatment and shall be accompanied by suggested letters from the Secretary to the President, to the Tariff Commission, and to the petitioner advising them of the Secretary's determination. The suggested letter from the Secretary to the President shall include a recommendation as to whether such emergency treatment should take the form of action by the President prior to receiving the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, or whether a decision by the President may appropriately be withheld until the recommendations of the Tariff Commission are received. If emergency treatment is not recommended, the report to the Secretary shall be accompanied by suggested letters from the Secretary to the petitioner and to the Tariff Commission stating the action taken. Each such report shall be submitted to the other offices, agencies, and bureaus of the Department of Agriculture whose activities would be affected, for concurrence or comment.
