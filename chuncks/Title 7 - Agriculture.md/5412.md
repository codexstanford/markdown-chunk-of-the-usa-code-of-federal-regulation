######## § 51.2128 Damage.
######### Damage

means any defect which materially detracts from the appearance of the individual kernel, or the edible or shipping quality of the almonds. Any one of the following defects or combination thereof, the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for any one defect shall be considered as damage:

(a) Chipped and scratched kernels, when the affected area on an individual kernel aggregates more than the equivalent of a circle one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) in diameter;

(b) Mold, when visible on the kernel, except when white or gray and easily rubbed off with the fingers;

(c) Gum, when a film of shiny, resinous appearing substance affects an area aggregating more than the equivalent of a circle one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) in diameter;

(d) Shriveling, when the kernel is excessively thin for its size, or when materially withered, shrunken, leathery, tough or only partially developed: Provided, that partially developed kernels are not considered damaged if more than three-fourths of the pellicle is filled with meat;

(e) Brown spot on the kernel, either single or multiple, when the affected area aggregates more than the equivalent of a circle one-eighth inch (3.2 mm) in diameter; and,

(f) Skin discoloration when more than one-half of the surface of the kernel is affected by very dark or black stains contrasting with the natural color of the skin.
