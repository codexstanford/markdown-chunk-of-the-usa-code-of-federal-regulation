###### Base and Supplemental Funding
####### § 39.105 Are additional funds available for special education?

(a) Schools may supplement the 15 percent base academic funding reserved under § 39.104 for special education with funds available under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). To obtain part B funds, the school must submit an application to OIEP. IDEA funds are available only if the school demonstrates that funds reserved under § 39.104(a) are inadequate to pay for services needed by all eligible ISEP students with disabilities.

(b) The Bureau will facilitate the delivery of IDEA part B funding by:

(1) Providing technical assistance to schools in completing the application for the funds; and

(2) Providing training to Bureau staff to improve the delivery of part B funds.
