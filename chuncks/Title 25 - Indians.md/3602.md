###### Grants of Rights-of-Way
####### § 169.124 How will BIA determine whether to grant a right-of-way?

Our decision to grant or deny a right-of-way will be in writing.

(a) We will grant a right-of-way unless:

(1) The requirements of this subpart have not been met, such as if the required landowner consent has not been obtained under § 169.107; or

(2) We find a compelling reason to withhold the grant in order to protect the best interests of the Indian landowners.

(b) We will defer, to the maximum extent possible, to the Indian landowners' determination that the right-of-way is in their best interest.

(c) We may not unreasonably withhold our grant of a right-of-way.

(d) We may grant one right-of-way for all of the tracts traversed by the right-of-way, or we may issue separate grants for one or more tracts traversed by the right-of-way.
