In no instance may there be discrimination against Indians or schools enrolling Indians. When informed by a complainant or through its own discovery that a possible violation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 exists within a State school district receiving funds, the Secretary will, in accordance with Federal requirements, notify the Department of Education of the possible violation. The Department Education will conduct an investigation into the matters alleged. If the report of the investigation conducted by the Department of Education discloses a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the non-compliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to contract or to continue financial assistance under the Johnson-O'Malley Act or by any other means authorized by law.
