###### § 213.46 Field clerks.

Local representatives known officially as "field clerks" are located in the various districts comprising that part of the State of Oklahoma occupied by the Five Civilized Tribes. Such field clerks shall report to and act under the direction of the Area Director. Any and all counsel and advice desired by allottees concerning deeds, leases, or other instruments or matters relating to lands allotted to them shall be furnished by such field clerks free of charge. Field clerks shall not, during their term of employment, have any personal interest, directly or indirectly, in any transaction concerning leases covering lands of allottees or in the purchase or sale of any such lands regardless of whether the restrictions have or have not been removed. This prohibition, however, shall not apply to lands which such field clerks have legally acquired before their employment in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Field clerks shall report to the Area Director at the end of each month the work performed during such period and special reports shall be made immediately of any apparently illegal transaction involving the estates or allotments of allottees.
