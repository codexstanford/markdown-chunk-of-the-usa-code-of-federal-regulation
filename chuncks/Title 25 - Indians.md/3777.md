####### § 170.412 How is the Tribal TTP long-range transportation plan developed and approved?

(a) The Tribal TTP long-range transportation plan is developed by either:

(1) A Tribe working through a self-determination contract, self-governance agreement, Program Agreement; and other appropriate agreement; or

(2) BIA or FHWA upon request of, and in consultation with, a Tribe. The Tribe and BIA or FHWA need to agree on the methodology and elements included in development of the TTP long-range transportation plan along with time frames before work begins. The development of a long-range transportation plan on behalf of a Tribe will be funded from the Tribe's share of the TTP funds.

(b) During the development of the TTP long-range transportation plan, the Tribe and BIA or FHWA will jointly conduct a midpoint review.

(c) The public reviews a draft TTP long-range transportation plan as required by § 170.413. The plan is further refined to address any issues identified during the public review process. The Tribe then approves the TTP long-range transportation plan.
