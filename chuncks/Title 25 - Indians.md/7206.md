##### § 900.127 What can be included in the Indian tribe or tribal organization's contract budget?

(a) The costs incurred will vary depending on which phase (see § 900.112) of the construction process the Indian tribe or tribal organization is conducting and the type of contract that will be used. The total amount awarded under a construction contract shall reflect an overall fair and reasonable price to the parties (see § 900.129).

(b) Costs for activities under this subpart that have not been billed, allocated, or recovered under a contract issued under section 108 of the Act should be included.

(c) The Indian tribe or tribal organization's budget should include the cost elements that reflect an overall fair and reasonable price. These costs include:

(1) The reasonable costs to the Indian tribe or tribal organization of performing the contract, taking into consideration the terms of the contract and the requirements of the Act and any other applicable law;

(2) The costs of preparing the contract proposal and supporting cost data;

(3) The costs associated with auditing the general and administrative costs of the Indian tribe or tribal organization associated with the management of the construction contract; and

(4) In cases where the Indian tribe or tribal organization is submitting a fixed-price construction contract:

(i) The reasonable costs to the Indian tribe or tribal organization for general administration incurred in connection with the project that is the subject of the contract;

(ii) The ability of the contractor that carries out the construction contract to make a reasonable profit, taking into consideration the risks associated with carrying out the contract, local market conditions, and other relevant considerations.

(d) In establishing a contract budget for a construction project, the Secretary shall not be required to identify separately the components described in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (c)(4)(ii) of this section.

(e) The Indian tribe or tribal organization's budget proposal includes a detailed budget breakdown for performing the scope of work including a total "not to exceed" dollar amount with which to perform the scope of work. Specific budget line items, if requested by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, can include the following:

(1) The administrative costs the Indian tribe or tribal organization may incur including:

(i) Personnel needed to provide administrative oversight of the contract;

(ii) Travel costs incurred, both local travel incurred as a direct result of conducting the contract and remote travel necessary to review project status with the Secretary;

(iii) Meeting costs incurred while meeting with community residents to develop project documents;

(iv) Fees to be paid to consultants, such as demographic consultants, planning consultants, attorneys, accountants, and personnel who will provide construction management services;

(2) The fees to be paid to architects and engineers to assist in preparing project documents and to assist in oversight of the construction process;

(3) The fees to be paid to develop project surveys including topographical surveys, site boundary descriptions, geotechnical surveys, archeological surveys, and NEPA compliance, and;

(4) In the case of a contract to conduct project construction activities, the fees to provide a part-time or full-time on-site inspector, depending on the terms of the contract, to monitor construction activities;

(5) In the case of a contract to conduct project construction activities, project site development costs;

(6) In the case of a contract to conduct project construction activities, project construction costs including those costs described in paragraph (c)(4), of this section;

(7) The cost of securing and installing moveable equipment, telecommunications and data processing equipment, furnishings, including works of art, and special purpose equipment when part of a construction contract;

(8) A contingency amount for unanticipated conditions of the construction phase of cost-reimbursable contracts. The amount of the contingency provided shall be 3 percent of activities being contracted or 50 percent of the available contingency funds, whichever is greater. In the event provision of required contingency funds will cause the project to exceed available project funds, the discrepancy shall be reconciled in accordance with § 900.129(e). Any additional contingency funds for the construction phase will be negotiated on an as-needed basis subject to the availability of funds and the nature, scope, and complexity of the project. Any contingency for other phases will be negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Unused contingency funds obligated to the contract and remaining at the end of the contract will be considered savings.

(9) Other costs incurred that are directly related to the conduct of contract activities.
