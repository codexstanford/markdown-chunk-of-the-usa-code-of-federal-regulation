(a) A person who shall operate any vehicle in a manner dangerous to the public safety is guilty of reckless driving, a petty misdemeanor, unless it is committed while under the influence of alcohol, in which case it is a misdemeanor.

(b) A person who shall drive, operate or be in physical control of any motor vehicle when his or her alcohol concentration is 0.10 or more shall be guilty of driving while intoxicated, a misdemeanor.

(c) Any person who drives, operates, or is in physical control of a motor vehicle within the Indian country under the jurisdiction of a Court of Indian Offenses consents to a chemical test of his or her blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the presence of alcohol, to be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer.
