(b) The code must promote the policies of the Indian Land Consolidation Act (ILCA) Amendments of 2000, which are to:

(1) Prevent further fractionation;

(2) Consolidate fractional interests into useable parcels;

(3) Consolidate fractional interests to enhance tribal sovereignty;

(4) Promote tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination; and

(5) Reverse the effects of the allotment policy on Indian tribes.

(c) Unless the conditions in paragraph (d) of this section are met, the code must not prohibit the devise of an interest to:

(2) An Indian who is not a member of the Indian tribe with jurisdiction over the interest in the land.

(d) If the tribal probate code prohibits the devise of an interest to the devisees in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, then the code must:
