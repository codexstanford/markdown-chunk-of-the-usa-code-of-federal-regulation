(1) The permit may be canceled by BIA under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 161.607 through 161.608;

(2) BIA may invoke any other remedies available to BIA under the permit;

(3) The Navajo Nation may invoke any remedies available to them under the permit; or

(4) The permittee may be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

(b) If BIA grants a permittee a time extension to cure a violation, the permittee must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time from the date on which the extension is granted.

(c) If BIA cancels the permit, BIA will send the permittee and the District Grazing Committee a written notice of cancellation within 5 business days of the decision. BIA will also provide actual or constructive notice of the cancellation to the Navajo Nation, as appropriate. The written notice of cancellation will:

(1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

(2) Notify the permittee of the amount of any unpaid fees and other financial obligations due under the permit;
