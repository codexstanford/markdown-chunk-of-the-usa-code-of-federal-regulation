###### § 20.202 What is a tribal redesign plan?

If you are a tribe administering a general assistance program, you can develop and submit to us a tribal redesign plan to change the way that you administer the program.

(a) A tribal redesign plan allows a tribe to:

(1) Change eligibility for general assistance in the service area; or

(2) Change the amount of general assistance payments for individuals within the service area.

(b) If you develop a tribal redesign plan it must:

(1) Treat all persons in the same situation equally; and

(2) Will not result in additional expenses for the Bureau solely because of any increased level of payments.
