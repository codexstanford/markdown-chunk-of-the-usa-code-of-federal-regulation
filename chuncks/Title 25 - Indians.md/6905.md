##### § 700.539 Soliciting contributions.

(a) An employee shall not solicit a contribution from another employee for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than himself or herself. (5 U.S.C. 7351) However, this paragraph does not preclude a voluntary gift of nominal value made on a special occasion.
