##### § 87.4 Conduct of hearings of record.

(a) As soon as appropriate after the tribal meetings have been held and the Commissioner has reviewed the tribal proposal(s), the Area Director, or such other official of the Department of the Interior as he shall designate to act for him, shall hold a hearing of record to receive testimony on the tribal proposal(s).

(b) The hearing shall be held after appropriate public notice beginning at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such hearing, and after consultation with the governing body of the tribe or group regarding the date and location of the hearing, to obtain the testimony of members of the governing body and other representatives, spokesmen or members of the tribe or group on the proposal(s).

(c) All testimony at the hearing shall be transcribed and a transcript thereof shall be furnished to the Commissioner and the tribal governing body immediately subsequent to the hearing. Particular care shall be taken to insure that minority views are given full opportunity for expression either during the hearing or in the form of written communications by the date of the hearing.

(d) Whenever two or more tribes or groups are involved in the use or distribution of the judgment funds, including situations in which two or more Area Offices are concerned, every effort shall be made by the Area Director or Directors to arrange for a single hearing to be conducted at a time and location as convenient to the involved tribes and groups as possible. Should the tribes and groups not reach agreement on such time or place, or on the number of entities to be represented at the hearing, the Commissioner, after considering the views of the affected tribes and groups, shall within twenty (20) days of receipt of such advice by the Area Director, designate a location and date for such hearing and invite the participation of all entities he considers to be involved and the Commissioner's decision shall be final.
