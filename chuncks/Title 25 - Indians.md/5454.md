(2) The methods of offset that may be employed;

(3) The debtor's opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the debt;

(4) The debtor's opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the Commission to repay the debt;

(5) The Commission's policy concerning interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs, as set out in § 513.5, including a statement that such assessments must be made against the debtor unless excused in accordance with the FCCS and this part;

(6) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges and enforced collection;

(7) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person or office at the Commission that is available to discuss the debt; and

(8) The debtor's opportunity for review.

(b) A debtor whose debt arises from a notice of violation and/or civil fine assessment that has become a final order and that was subject to the Commission's appeal procedures at 25 CFR parts 580 through 585 may not re-litigate matters that were the subject of the final order.
