####### § 20.313 How will the Bureau compute financial assistance payments?

(a) The social services worker will compute financial assistance payments by beginning with the Bureau standard of assistance and doing the following:

(1) Subtracting from all resources calculated under §§ 20.307 through 20.310;

(2) Subtracting the rateable reduction or maximum payment level used by the state where the applicant lives;

(3) Subtracting an amount for shelter (see paragraph (b) of this section for details on how to calculate a shelter amount); and

(4) Rounding the result down to the next lowest dollar.

(b) The social services worker must calculate a shelter amount for purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section. To calculate the shelter amount:

(1) The shelter amount must not exceed the amount for shelter in the state TANF standard;

(2) If the state TANF does not specify an amount for shelter, the social services worker must calculate the amount as 25 percent of the total state TANF payment; and

(3) If there is more than one household in a dwelling, the social services worker must prorate the actual shelter cost among the households receiving General Assistance; this amount cannot exceed the amount in the standard for individuals in similar circumstances. The head of each household is responsible for his/her portion of the documented shelter cost.

(c) The social services worker must not provide General Assistance payments for any period before the date of the application for assistance.
