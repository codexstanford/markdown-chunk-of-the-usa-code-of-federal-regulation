####### § 170.415 What are pre-project planning and project identification studies?

(a) Pre-project planning and project identification studies are part of overall transportation planning and include the activities conducted before final project approval on the TTPTIP. These processes provide the information necessary to financially constrain and program a project on the four-year TTPTIP but are not the final determination that projects will be designed and built. These activities include:

(1) Preliminary project cost estimates;

(2) Certification of public involvement;

(3) Consultation and coordination with States and/or MPO's for regionally significant projects;

(4) Preliminary needs assessments; and

(5) Preliminary environmental and archeological reviews.

(b) BIA and/or FHWA, upon request of the Tribe, will work cooperatively with Tribal, State, regional, and metropolitan transportation planning organizations concerning the leveraging of funds from non-TTP sources and identification of other funding sources to expedite the planning, design, and construction of projects on the TTPTIP.
