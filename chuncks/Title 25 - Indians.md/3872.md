(a) Tribal, State, and local governments may provide an Indian employment preference for Indians living on or near a reservation on projects and contracts that meet the definition of a Tribal transportation facility. (See 23 U.S.C. 101(a)(12) and 140(d), and 23 CFR 635.117(d).)

(b) Tribes may target recruiting efforts toward Indians living on or near Indian reservations, Tribal lands, Alaska Native villages, pueblos, and Indian communities.

(c) Tribes and Tribal employment rights offices should work cooperatively with State and local governments to develop contract provisions promoting employment opportunities for Indians on eligible federally funded transportation projects. Tribal, State, and local representatives should confer to establish Indian employment goals for these projects.
