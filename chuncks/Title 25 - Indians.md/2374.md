(c) The further subsections of this section authorize certain employees contracting and trading with Indians as authorized by the exceptions in section 437 of title 18 U.S. Code. All such contracting and trading is subject to the express provision of section 437 that none of the sales or purchases so authorized may be made if the purpose of any such sale, trade, or purchase is that of commercially selling, reselling, trading, or bartering such property.

(d)(1) Under authority granted by section 437(b)(1) of title 18 U.S. Code, employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs may with the approval of an authorized officer of the Bureau, as designated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, purchase from or sell to an Indian any service or any real or personal property, not held in trust by the United States or subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States, or any interest in such property. In addition, employees may purchase from Indians without approval from an authorized officer of the Bureau any non-trust or unrestricted personal property for home use or consumption the value of which property does not exceed $1000. Where the purchase or sale price is less than $1,000, employees may also purchase motor vehicles for their personal use from Indians or sell their personal motor vehicles to Indians without obtaining approval of such purchases or sales from an authorized officer of the Bureau.

(2) Trading by employees with Indians which involves property or funds which are either held in trust by the United States or are subject to restrictions against alienation imposed by the United States must be conducted on the basis of sealed bid or public auction. If the trading involves leases or sales of trust or restricted Indian land it must be conducted on the basis of sealed bids. Such requirements for sealed bid or public auction may only be waived by the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs on the basis of a full report showing:

(i) The need for the transaction,

(ii) The benefits accruing to both parties,

(iii) That the consideration for the proposed transaction shall be not less than the fair market value of the trust or restricted property or interest therein, unless the employee is involved in a transaction in accordance with § 152.25(c) or (d) or § 162.5(b)(1), (2), or (3) of this title or the employee is the recipient of a benefit for tribal members for which a uniform charge to all members is made, and

(iv) An affidavit as follows shall accompany each proposed transaction: "I (name) (title), swear (or affirm) that I have not exercised any undue influence nor used any special knowledge received by reason of my employment in the Bureau in obtaining the (grantor's, purchaser's, vendor's) consent to the instant transaction."

(3) The authorized officer of the Bureau for employees employed on reservations, in agencies or service units is one who is not a relative by blood or marriage of the employee, and is not employed at the employee's reservation, agency or service unit. That officer must also be employed at not less than one grade level higher than such employee at the Washington, District of Columbia, Central Office or at an Area Office other than that with authority over the employee's reservation, agency, or service unit.

(4) The authorized officer of the Bureau for employees employed in Area offices is one who is not a relative by blood or marriage of the employee, is not employed at the employee's area office, and must be employed at not less than one grade level higher than the employee at the Washington, District of Columbia, Central Office.

(f) Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) of section 437 of title 18 U.S. Code as implemented by this section, nothing in the cited law shall be construed as preventing any employee of the Bureau who is an Indian, of whatever degree of Indian blood, from obtaining or receiving any benefit or benefits made available to Indians generally or to any member of his or her particular tribe, under any Act of Congress, nor to prevent any such employee who is an Indian from being a member of or receiving benefits by reason of his or her membership in any Indian tribe, corporation, or cooperative association organized by Indians, when authorized under such rules and regulations as the Secretary or his/her designee has prescribed or shall prescribe.
