(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section when a self-determination contract or grant agreement, or portion thereof, is retroceded, reassumed, terminated, or expires, the Secretary shall have the option to take title to any item of government-furnished property:

(1) Whose title has been transferred to an Indian tribe or tribal organization;

(b) If property referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is shared between one or more ongoing contracts or grant agreements and a contract or grant agreement that is retroceded, reassumed, terminated or expires and the Secretary wishes to use such property in the retroceded or reassumed program, the Secretary and the contractor or grantee using such property shall negotiate an acceptable arrangement for continued sharing of such property and for the retention or transfer of title.
