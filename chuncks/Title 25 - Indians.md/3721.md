###### Use of TTP and Cultural Site or Area Entry Roads
####### § 170.115 What is a cultural site or area entry road?

(a) A cultural site or area entry road is a public road that provides access to sites for cultural purposes as defined by Tribal traditions, which may include, for example:

(1) Sacred and medicinal sites;

(2) Gathering medicines or materials such as grasses for basket weaving; and

(3) Other traditional activities, including, but not limited to, subsistence hunting, fishing and gathering.

(b) A Tribal government may unilaterally designate a Tribal road as a cultural site or area entry road. A cultural site or area entry road designation is an entirely voluntary and internal decision made by the Tribe to help it and other public authorities manage, protect, and preserve access to locations that have cultural significance.

(c) In order for a Tribal government to designate a non-tribal road as a cultural site or area entry road, it must enter into an agreement with the public authority having jurisdiction over the road.

(d) Cultural site or area entry roads may be included in the NTTFI if they meet the definition of a TTP facility.
