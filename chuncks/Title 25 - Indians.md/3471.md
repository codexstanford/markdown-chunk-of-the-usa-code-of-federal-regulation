##### § 167.16 Fences.

Favorable recommendation from the District Grazing Committee and a written authorization from the Superintendent or his authorized representative must be secured before any fences may be constructed in non-agricultural areas. The District Grazing Committee shall recommend to the Superintendent the removal of unauthorized existing fences, or fences enclosing demonstration areas no longer used as such, if it is determined that such fences interfere with proper range management or an equitable distribution of range privileges. All enclosures fenced for the purpose of protecting agricultural land shall be kept to a size commensurate with the needs for protection of agricultural land and must be enclosed by legal four strand barbed wire fence or the equivalent.
