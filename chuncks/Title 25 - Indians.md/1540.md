###### § 48.106 May a lessee construct permanent improvements under a lease?

(a) The lessee may construct permanent improvements under a lease of a Bureau-operated facility only if the lease contains the following provisions:

(1) A description of the type and location of any permanent improvements to be constructed by the lessee and a general schedule for construction of the permanent improvements, including dates for commencement and completion of construction;

(2) Specification of who owns the permanent improvements the lessee constructs during the lease term and specifies whether each specific permanent improvement the lessee constructs will:

(i) Remain on the leased premises, upon the expiration, cancellation, or termination of the lease, in a condition satisfactory to the Director, and become the property of the Bureau-operated school;

(ii) Be removed within a time period specified in the lease, at the lessee's expense, with the leased premises to be restored as closely as possible to their condition before construction of the permanent improvements; or

(iii) Be disposed of by other specified means.

(3) Due diligence requirements that require the lessee to complete construction of any permanent improvements within the schedule specified in the lease or general schedule of construction, and a process for changing the schedule by mutual consent of the parties.

(i) If construction does not occur, or is not expected to be completed, within the time period specified in the lease, the lessee must provide the Director with an explanation of good cause as to the nature of any delay, the anticipated date of construction of facilities, and evidence of progress toward commencement of construction.

(ii) Failure of the lessee to comply with the due diligence requirements of the lease is a violation of the lease and may lead to cancellation of the lease.

(b) The lessee must prepare the required information and analyses, including information to facilitate the Bureau's analysis under applicable environmental and cultural resource requirements.

(c) The Bureau may take appropriate enforcement action to ensure removal of the permanent improvements and restoration of the premises at the lessee's expense before or after expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease. The Bureau may collect and hold the performance bond or alternative form of security until removal and restoration are completed.
