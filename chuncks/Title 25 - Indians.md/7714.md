##### § 1187.22 How will OIED conduct the site evaluation?

(a) Before awarding a grant to an eligible applicant, OIED will conduct an evaluation of the proposed site to verify that the applicant has (or will have) the physical workspace, equipment, and connectivity necessary for Native businesses and Native entrepreneurs to collaborate and conduct business on a local, regional, national, and/or international level.

(b) To determine whether the site meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) If the applicant is in possession of the proposed site, OIED will conduct an on-site visit or review a video submission before awarding the grant.

(2) If the applicant is not yet in possession of the proposed site and has submitted a written site proposal, OIED will review the written site proposal before awarding the grant and will conduct an on-site visit or review a video submission to ensure the site is consistent with the written site proposal no later than one year after awarding the grant. If OIED determines the site is not consistent with the written site proposal, OIED will use that information in determining the ongoing eligibility of the applicant under § 1187.50.
