###### § 169.3 To what land does this part apply?

(a) This part applies to Indian land and BIA land.

(b) We will not take any action on a right-of-way across fee land or collect compensation on behalf of fee interest owners. We will not condition our grant of a right-of-way across Indian land or BIA land on the applicant having obtained a right-of-way from the owners of any fee interests. The applicant will be responsible for negotiating directly with and making any payments directly to the owners of any fee interests that may exist in the property on which the right-of-way is granted.

(c) We will not include the fee interests in a tract in calculating the applicable percentage of interests required for consent to a right-of-way.
