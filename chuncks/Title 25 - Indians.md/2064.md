(1) Is not included as part of the loan principal; and

(2) Does not bear interest;

(b) Charges of any kind by the lender or by any third party except for the reasonable and customary cost of legal and architectural services, broker commissions, surveys, compliance inspections, title inspection and/or insurance, lien searches, appraisals, recording costs, premiums for required hazard, liability, key man life, and other kinds of insurance, and such other charges as BIA may approve in writing;

(c) A loan repayment term of over 30 years;

(d) Payments scheduled less frequently than annually;

(e) A prepayment penalty, unless the terms of the penalty are clearly specified in BIA's loan guaranty or loan insurance conditions;

(f) An interest rate greater than what BIA considers reasonable, taking into account the range of rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans;

(h) An increased rate of interest based on default;

(i) A fee imposed for the late repayment of any installment due, except for a late fee that:

(1) Is imposed only after the borrower is at least 30 days late with payment;

(2) Does not bear interest; and

(3) Equals no more than 5 percent of the late installment;

(j) An "insecurity" clause, or any similar provision permitting the lender to declare a loan default solely on the basis of its subjective view of the borrower's changed repayment prospects;

(k) A requirement that the borrower take title to any real or personal property purchased with loan proceeds by a title instrument containing restrictions on alienation, control or use of the property, unless otherwise required by applicable law; or

(l) A requirement that a borrower which is a tribe provide as security a general assignment of the tribe's trust income. If otherwise lawful, a tribe may provide as loan security an assignment of trust income from a specific source.
