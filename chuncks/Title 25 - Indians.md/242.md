(a) The petition must be made under oath or accompanied by a sworn affidavit setting out specific facts describing the act of domestic violence.

(b) The petitioner is not required to file for annulment, separation, or divorce in order to obtain an order of protection. However, the petition should state whether any legal action is pending between the petitioner and the respondent.
