####### § 162.252 What will BIA do if a violation of an agricultural lease is not cured within the requisite time period?

(a) If the tenant does not cure a violation of an agricultural lease within the requisite time period, we will consult with the Indian landowners, as appropriate, and determine whether:

(1) The lease should be canceled by us under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 162.253 through 162.254 of this subpart;

(2) We should invoke any other remedies available to us under the lease, including collecting on any available bond;

(3) The Indian landowners wish to invoke any remedies available to them under the lease; or

(4) The tenant should be granted additional time in which to cure the violation.

(b) If we decide to grant a tenant additional time in which to cure a violation, the tenant must proceed diligently to complete the necessary corrective actions within a reasonable or specified time period from the date on which the extension is granted.

(c) If we decide to cancel the lease, we will send the tenant and its sureties a cancellation letter within five business days of that decision. The cancellation letter must be sent to the tenant by certified mail, return receipt requested. We will also provide actual or constructive notice of a cancellation decision to the Indian landowners, as appropriate. The cancellation letter will:

(1) Explain the grounds for cancellation;

(2) Notify the tenant of the amount of any unpaid rent, interest charges, or late payment penalties due under the lease;

(3) Notify the tenant of its right to appeal under part 2 of this chapter, as modified by § 162.253 of this subpart, including the amount of any appeal bond that must be posted with an appeal of the cancellation decision; and

(4) Order the tenant to vacate the property within 30 days of the date of receipt of the cancellation letter, if an appeal is not filed by that time.
