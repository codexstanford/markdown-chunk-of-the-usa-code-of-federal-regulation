### PART 900 - CONTRACTS UNDER THE INDIAN SELF-DETERMINATION AND EDUCATION ASSISTANCE ACT
#### Subpart K - Waiver Procedures
##### § 900.145 On what basis may the Secretary deny a waiver request?

Consistent with section 107(e) of the Act, the Secretary may only deny a waiver request based on a specific written finding. The finding must clearly demonstrate (or be supported by controlling legal authority) that if the waiver is granted:

(a) The service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the particular program or function to be contracted will not be satisfactory;

(b) Adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;

(c) The proposed project or function to be contracted for cannot be properly completed or maintained by the proposed contract;

(d) The amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under section 106(a) of the Act; or

(e) The program, function, service, or activity (or portion of it) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities that are contractible under the Act because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.
