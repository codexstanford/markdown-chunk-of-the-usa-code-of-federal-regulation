####### § 162.417 What requirements for due diligence must a business lease include?

(a) If permanent improvements are to be constructed, the business lease must include due diligence requirements that require the lessee to complete construction of any permanent improvements within the schedule specified in the lease or general schedule of construction, and a process for changing the schedule by mutual consent of the parties. If construction does not occur, or is not expected to be completed, within the time period specified in the lease, the lessee must provide the Indian landowners and BIA with an explanation of good cause as to the nature of any delay, the anticipated date of construction of facilities, and evidence of progress toward commencement of construction.

(b) Failure of the lessee to comply with the due diligence requirements of the lease is a violation of the lease and may lead to cancellation of the lease under § 162.467.

(c) BIA may waive the requirements in this section if such waiver is in the best interest of the Indian landowners.

(d) The requirements of this section do not apply to leases for religious, educational, recreational, cultural, or other public purposes.
