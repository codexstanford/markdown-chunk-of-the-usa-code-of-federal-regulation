The motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the factual basis for the motion and the amounts requested.

(b) As a part of a motion for temporary maintenance or support or by an independent motion accompanied by an affidavit, either party may request the Court of Indian Offenses to issue a temporary injunction for any of the following relief:

(1) Restraining any person from transferring, encumbering, concealing, or otherwise disposing of any property except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life, and, if so restrained, requiring him or her to notify the moving party of any proposed extraordinary expenditures made after the order is issued;

(2) Enjoining a party from molesting or disturbing the peace of the other party or of any child;

(4) Enjoining a party from removing a child from the jurisdiction of the court; and

(5) Providing other injunctive relief proper in the circumstances.

(c) The court may issue a temporary restraining order without requiring notice to the other party only if it finds on the basis of the moving affidavit or other evidence that irreparable injury will result to the moving party if no order is issued until the time for responding has elapsed.

(d) A response may be filed within 20 days after service of notice of a motion or at the time specified in the temporary restraining order.

(2) May be revoked or modified before the final decree as deemed necessary by the court;

(3) Terminates when the final decree is entered or when the petition for dissolution or legal separation is voluntarily dismissed.
