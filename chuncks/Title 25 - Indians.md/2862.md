(ii) Be payable to us;

(iii) Be irrevocable during its term and have an initial expiration date of not less than one year following the date of issuance; and

(iv) Be automatically renewable for a period of not less than one year, unless the issuing financial institution provides us with written notice that it will not be renewed, at least 90 calendar days before the letter of credit's expiration date.
