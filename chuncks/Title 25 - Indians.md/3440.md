We will:

(a) Investigate accidental, willful, and/or incidental trespass on Indian agricultural land;

(b) Respond to alleged trespass in a prompt, efficient manner;

(c) Assess trespass penalties for the value of products used or removed, cost of damage to the Indian agricultural land, and enforcement costs incurred as a consequence of the trespass.

(d) Ensure that damage to Indian agricultural lands resulting from trespass is rehabilitated and stabilized at the expense of the trespasser.
