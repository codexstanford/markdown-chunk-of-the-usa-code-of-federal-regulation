###### § 273.207 How does a contractor request dispute resolution?

The contractor may request dispute resolution in writing to the BIE Director.

(a) The Bureau has in place an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process.

(1) The ADR process is intended to be a supplement to, and not a replacement for, the normal appeal process.

(2) Participation as a complainant in the ADR process is voluntary.

(3) Should a contractor participate in an ADR process, the pre-complaint process may extend to 90 days.

(b) The ADR process may result in an informal resolution of the complaint;

(c) If the ADR process does not result in an informal resolution of the complaint, the contractor still has the right to continue to pursue an appeal.
