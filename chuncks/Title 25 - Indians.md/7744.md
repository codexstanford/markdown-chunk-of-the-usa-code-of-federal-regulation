## Chapter VII - Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, Department of the Interior
### PART 1200 - AMERICAN INDIAN TRUST FUND MANAGEMENT REFORM ACT
#### Subpart A - General Provisions
##### § 1200.3 What is the Department's policy on tribal management of trust funds?

(a) We will give tribes as much responsibility as they desire for the management of their tribal funds that we currently hold in trust.

(b) Title II of the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act, implemented by these regulations, offers tribes one approach for assuming increased management of their funds that we now hold in trust and administer. Under title II, a tribe may completely remove its funds from Federal trust status and manage them as it wishes, subject to the requirements and conditions in this part. When a tribe withdraws its funds under this part, it may invest those funds in equities or other investment vehicles that are statutorily unavailable to us.
