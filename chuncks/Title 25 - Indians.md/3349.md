(a) We will remove Indian land from the permit if:

(3) A tribe allocates grazing privileges for Indian land covered by your permit under § 166.218 of this part;

(4) The permittee requests removal of the Indian land, the owners of the majority interest of the Indian land provides written approval of the removal of the Indian land, and we determine that the removal is warranted; or

(5) We determine that removal of the Indian land is appropriate, with the written approval of the owners of the majority interest of the Indian land.

(b) We will revise the grazing capacity to reflect the removal of Indian land and show it on the permit.
