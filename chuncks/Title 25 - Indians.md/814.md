###### § 30.121 How will the Secretary implement requirements for comprehensive support and improvement activities?

(a) Once notified that it has been identified for comprehensive support and improvement, each BIE-funded school is required to develop and implement, in partnership with stakeholders (including principals and other school leaders, teachers, and parents), a comprehensive support and improvement plan to improve student outcomes that:

(1) Is informed by all indicators described in § 30.111(f), including student performance against BIE-determined long-term goals described in § 30.111(d);

(2) Includes evidence-based interventions;

(3) Is based on a school-level needs assessment;

(4) Identifies resource inequities, which may include a review of school-level budgeting, to be addressed through implementation of such comprehensive support and improvement plan;

(5) Is approved by the school and the BIE; and

(6) Upon approval and implementation, is monitored and periodically reviewed by the BIE.

(b) In regard to high schools that have been identified as having failed to graduate one-third or more of their students, the BIE may:

(1) Permit differentiated improvement activities that use evidence-based interventions in the case of a school that predominantly serves students:

(i) Returning to education after having exited secondary school without a regular high school diploma; or

(ii) Who, based on their grade or age, are significantly off track to accumulate sufficient academic credits to meet high school graduation requirements; and

(2) In the case of a school that has a total enrollment of fewer than 100 students, permit the BIE-funded school to forego implementation of improvement activities.
