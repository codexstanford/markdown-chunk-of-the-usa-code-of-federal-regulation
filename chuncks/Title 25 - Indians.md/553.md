###### How Child Assistance Funds Can Be Used
####### § 20.504 What short-term homemaker services can Child Assistance pay for?

You, the social services program, can use Child Assistance funds to pay for homemaker services as specified in § 20.501 and this section. While housekeeping services are covered, homemaker services must focus on training household members in such skills as child care and home management. Homemaker services are provided for:

(a) A child who would otherwise need foster care placement or who would benefit from supportive (protective) supervision;

(b) A severely handicapped or special needs child whose care places undue stress on the family; or

(c) A child whose care would benefit from specialized training and supportive services provided to family members.
