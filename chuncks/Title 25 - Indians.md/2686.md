(a) Grazing permits should not be issued for less than 2 animal units (10 sheep units) or exceed 70 animal units (350 sheep units). However, all grazing permits issued before the adoption of this regulation will be honored and reissued with an adjusted stocking rate if the permittee meets the eligibility and priority criteria found in § 161.400 of this part, and only if the carrying capacity and stocking rate as determined under §§ 161.204 and 161.403 allows.

(b) A grazing permit will be issued in the name of one individual.

(c) Only two horses will be permitted on a grazing permit.

(d) Grazing permits may contain additional conditions authorized by Federal law or Navajo Nation law.

(e) A state/tribal brand only identifies the owner of the livestock, but does not authorize the grazing of any livestock within the Navajo Partitioned Lands.

(f) A permit cannot be subdivided once it has been issued.
