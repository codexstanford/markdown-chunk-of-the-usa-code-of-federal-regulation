#### PART 584 - APPEALS BEFORE A PRESIDING OFFICIAL
##### § 584.9 How may I request to limit disclosure of confidential information?

(a) If any person submitting a document in a proceeding claims that some or all of the information contained in that document is:

(1) Exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);

(2) Information referred to in 18 U.S.C. 1905 (disclosure of confidential information); or

(3) Otherwise exempt by law from public disclosure, the person shall:

(i) Indicate that the whole document is exempt from disclosure or identify and segregate information within the document that is exempt from disclosure; and

(ii) Request that the presiding official not disclose such information to the parties to the proceeding (other than the Chair, whose actions regarding the disclosure of confidential information are governed by § 571.3 of this chapter) except pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and shall serve the request upon the parties to the proceeding. The request to the presiding official shall include:

(A) A copy of the document, group of documents, or segregable portions of the documents marked "Confidential Treatment Requested"; and

(B) A statement explaining why the information is confidential.

(b) If the presiding official determines that confidential treatment is not warranted with respect to all or any part of the information in question, the presiding official shall so inform all parties. The person requesting confidential treatment then shall be given an opportunity to withdraw the document before it is considered by the presiding official, or to disclose the information voluntarily to all parties.

(c) If the presiding official determines that confidential treatment is warranted, the presiding official shall so inform all parties.

(d) If the presiding official determines that confidential treatment is warranted, a party to a proceeding may request that the presiding official direct the person submitting the confidential information to provide that information to the party. The presiding official may so direct if the party requesting the information agrees under oath and in writing:

(1) Not to use or disclose the information except directly in connection with the hearing; and

(2) To return all copies of the information at the conclusion of the proceeding to the person submitting the information under paragraph (a) of this section.

(e) If a person submitting documents in a proceeding under this part does not claim confidentiality under paragraph (a) of this section, the presiding official may assume that there is no objection to disclosure of the document in its entirety.

(f) When a decision by a presiding official is based in whole or in part on evidence not included in the record, the decision shall so state, specifying the nature of the evidence and the provision of law under which disclosure was denied, and the evidence so considered shall be retained under seal as part of the official record.
