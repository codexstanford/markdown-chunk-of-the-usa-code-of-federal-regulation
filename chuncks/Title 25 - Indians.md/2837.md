###### How to Obtain a Lease
####### § 162.210 When can BIA grant a permit covering agricultural land?

(a) We may grant a permit covering agricultural land in the same manner as we would grant an agricultural lease under § 162.209 of this part. We may also grant a permit on behalf of individual Indian landowners, without prior notice, if it is impractical to provide notice to the owners and no substantial injury to the land will occur.

(b) We may grant a permit covering agricultural land, but not an agricultural lease, on government land.

(c) We will not grant a permit on tribal agricultural land, but a tribe may grant a permit, subject to our approval, in the same manner as it would grant a lease under § 162.207(a) of this subpart.
