Upon its own motion or the motion of a party, the Commission may allow the submission of additional evidence. A party may file a motion for leave to submit additional evidence at any time prior to issuance of a final decision by the Commission.

The Commission may adjust its time for issuing a final decision accordingly, unless the subject of the appeal is a temporary closure order.
