(a) Before the probate case is submitted to OHA, you may request an amount of no more than $5,000 from the decedent's IIM account if:

(1) You are responsible for making the funeral arrangements on behalf of the family of a decedent who has an IIM account;

(2) You have not received sufficient funds from the decedent's Tribe to pay the entire cost of the funeral arrangements; and

(3) You have an immediate need to pay for funeral arrangements before burial.

(b) You must apply for funds under paragraph (a) of this section and submit to us an original itemized estimate of the cost of the service to be rendered and the identification of the service provider.

(c) In response to a request submitted under paragraph (a) of this section, we may approve, without the need for an order from OHA, costs of no more than $5,000 from the date of death IIM account balance that are reasonable and necessary for the burial services, taking into consideration:

(1) The availability of non-trust funds, including availability of any Tribal contribution; and

(2) Any other relevant factors.
