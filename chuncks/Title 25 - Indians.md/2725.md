Unless otherwise provided by Navajo Nation law:

(a) BIA will treat any amounts recovered under § 161.712 as proceeds from the sale of agricultural property from the Navajo Partitioned Lands upon which the trespass occurred.

(b) Proceeds recovered under § 161.712 may be distributed to:

(1) Repair damages of the Navajo Partitioned Lands and property; or

(2) Reimburse the affected parties, including the permittee for loss due to the trespass, as negotiated and provided in the permit.

(c) Reimburse for costs associated with the enforcement.

(d) If any money is left over after the distribution of the proceeds described in paragraph (b) of this section, BIA will return it to the trespasser or, where the owner of the impounded property cannot be identified within 180 days, the net proceeds of the sale will be deposited into the appropriate Navajo Nation account or transferred to the Navajo Nation under applicable tribal law.
