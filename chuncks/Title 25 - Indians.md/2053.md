###### § 103.4 What kinds of loans will BIA guarantee or insure?

In general, BIA may guarantee or insure any loan made by an eligible lender to an eligible borrower to conduct a lawful business organized for profit. There are several important exceptions:

(a) The business must contribute to the economy of an Indian reservation or tribal service area recognized by BIA;

(b) The borrower may not use the loan for relending purposes;

(c) If any portion of the loan is used to refinance an existing loan, the borrower must be current on the existing loan; and

(d) BIA may not guarantee or insure a loan if it believes the lender would be willing to extend the requested financing without a BIA guaranty or insurance coverage.
