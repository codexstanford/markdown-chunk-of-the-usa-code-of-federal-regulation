#### Subpart E - Grant Term and Conditions
##### § 1187.43 May OIED waive the requirement for the non-Federal contribution?

OIED may waive the requirement for the non-Federal contribution, in whole or in part, for one or more years of the initial IBIP grant award if OIED determines that the waiver is appropriate based on:

(a) The awardee's ability to provide non-Federal contributions;

(b) The quality of business incubation services; and

(c) The likelihood that one or more reservation communities served by the awardee will not receive similar services elsewhere because of the remoteness or other reasons that inhibit the provision of business and entrepreneurial development services.
