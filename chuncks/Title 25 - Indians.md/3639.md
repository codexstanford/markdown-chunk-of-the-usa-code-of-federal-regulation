If an individual or entity takes possession of, or uses, Indian land or BIA land without a right-of-way and a right-of-way is required, the unauthorized possession or use is a trespass. An unauthorized use within an existing right-of-way is also a trespass.

The Indian landowners may pursue any available remedies under applicable law, including applicable tribal law.
