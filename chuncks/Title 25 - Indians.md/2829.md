####### § 162.202 How will tribal laws be enforced on agricultural land?

(a) Unless prohibited by federal law, we will recognize and comply with tribal laws regulating activities on agricultural land, including tribal laws relating to land use, environmental protection, and historic or cultural preservation.

(b) While the tribe is primarily responsible for enforcing tribal laws pertaining to agricultural land, we will:

(1) Assist in the enforcement of tribal laws;

(2) Provide notice of tribal laws to persons or entities undertaking activities on agricultural land, under § 162.204(c) of this subpart; and

(3) Require appropriate federal officials to appear in tribal forums when requested by the tribe, so long as such an appearance would not:

(i) Be inconsistent with the restrictions on employee testimony set forth at 43 CFR Part 2, Subpart E;

(ii) Constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States; or

(iii) Authorize or result in a review of our actions by a tribal court.

(c) Where the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a tribal law, but such regulations cannot be superseded or modified by the tribal law under § 162.109 of this part, we may waive the regulations under part 1 of this chapter, so long as the waiver does not violate a federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with our general trust responsibility under federal law.
