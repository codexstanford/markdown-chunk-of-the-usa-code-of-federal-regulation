(3) Issue your bill monthly, unless otherwise provided in a Special Agreement.

(c) If we are unable to calculate your metered energy consumption, we must make a reasonable estimate based on one of the following reasons:

(2) Your meter has been tampered with; or

(3) Our utility personnel are unable to read your meter.
