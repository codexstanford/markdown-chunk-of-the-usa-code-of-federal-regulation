####### § 162.014 What laws will apply to leases approved under this part?

(a) In addition to the regulations in this part, leases approved under this part:

(1) Are subject to applicable Federal laws and any specific Federal statutory requirements that are not incorporated in this part;

(2) Are subject to tribal law, subject to paragraph (b) of this section; and

(3) Are not subject to State law or the law of a political subdivision thereof except that:

(i) State law or the law of a political subdivision thereof may apply in the specific areas and circumstances in Indian country where the Indian tribe with jurisdiction has made it expressly applicable;

(ii) State law may apply in the specific areas and circumstances in Indian country where Congress has made it expressly applicable; and

(iii) State law may apply where a Federal court has expressly applied State law to a specific area or circumstance in Indian country in the absence of Federal or tribal law.

(b) Tribal laws generally apply to land under the jurisdiction of the tribe enacting the laws, except to the extent that those tribal laws are inconsistent with these regulations or other applicable Federal law. However, these regulations may be superseded or modified by tribal laws, as long as:

(1) The tribe has notified us of the superseding or modifying effect of the tribal laws;

(2) The superseding or modifying of the regulation would not violate a Federal statute or judicial decision, or conflict with our general trust responsibility under Federal law; and

(3) The superseding or modifying of the regulation applies only to tribal land.

(c) Unless prohibited by Federal law, the parties to a lease may subject that lease to State or local law in the absence of Federal or tribal law, if:

(1) The lease includes a provision to this effect; and

(2) The Indian landowners expressly agree to the application of State or local law.

(d) An agreement under paragraph (c) of this section does not waive a tribe's sovereign immunity unless the tribe expressly states its intention to waive sovereign immunity in the lease of tribal land.
