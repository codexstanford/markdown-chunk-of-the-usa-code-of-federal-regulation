####### § 169.129 What is required if the location described in the original application and grant differs from the construction location?

(a) If engineering or other complications prevented construction within the location identified in the original application and grant, and required a minor deviation from the location identified in the original application and grant, then we and the tribe, for tribal land, will determine whether the change in location requires one or more of the following:

(1) An amended map of definite location;

(2) Landowner consent;

(3) A valuation or, with landowner consent, a recalculation of compensation;

(4) Additional compensation or security; or

(5) Other actions required to comply with applicable laws.

(b) If BIA and the tribe, for tribal land, determine it is not a minor deviation in location, we may require a new right-of-way grant or amendment to the right-of-way grant.

(c) If we grant a right-of-way for the new route or location, the applicant must execute instruments to extinguish, or amend, as appropriate, the right-of-way at the original location identified in the application.

(d) We will transmit the instruments to extinguish or amend the right-of-way to the LTRO for recording.
