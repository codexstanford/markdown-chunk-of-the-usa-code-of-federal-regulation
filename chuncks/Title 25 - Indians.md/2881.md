A cancellation decision involving an agricultural lease will not be effective until 30 days after the tenant receives a cancellation letter from us. The cancellation decision will remain ineffective if the tenant files an appeal under § 162.253 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, unless the decision is made immediately effective under part 2. While a cancellation decision is ineffective, the tenant must continue to pay rent and comply with the other terms of the lease. If an appeal is not filed in accordance with § 162.253 of this subpart and part 2 of this chapter, the cancellation decision will be effective on the 31st day after the tenant receives the cancellation letter from us.
