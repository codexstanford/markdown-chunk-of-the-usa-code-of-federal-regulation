####### § 166.400 Who establishes grazing rental rates?

(a) For tribal lands, a tribe may establish a grazing rental rate that is less or more than the grazing rental rate established by us. We will assist a tribe to establish a grazing rental rate by providing the tribe with available information concerning the value of grazing on tribal lands.

(b) We will establish the grazing rental rate by determining the fair annual rental for:

(1) Individually-owned Indian lands; and

(2) Tribes that have not established a rate under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Indian landowners may give us written authority to grant grazing privileges on their individually-owned Indian land at a grazing rental rate that is:

(1) Above the grazing rental rate set by us; or

(2) Below the grazing rental rate set by us, subject to our approval, when the permittee is a member of the Indian landowner's immediate family as defined in this part.
