(b) In addition to or in lieu of the penalties provided in paragraph (a) of this section, the court may require a convicted offender who has inflicted injury upon the person or property of another to make restitution or compensate the injured person by means of the surrender of property, payment of money damages, or the performance of any other act for the benefit of the injured party.

(c) If, solely because of indigence, a convicted offender is unable to pay forthwith a money fine assessed under any applicable section, the court shall allow him or her a reasonable period of time to pay the entire sum or allow him or her to make reasonable installment payments to the clerk of the court at specified intervals until the entire sum is paid. If the offender defaults on such payments the court may find him or her in contempt of court and imprison him or her accordingly.
