##### § 1187.21 How will OIED evaluate the proposed location of the business incubator?

In evaluating the proposed location of the business incubator, OIED will:

(a) Consider the program goal of achieving broad geographic distribution of business incubators; and

(b) Give priority to eligible applicants that will provide business incubation services on or near the reservation of the one or more communities that were described in the application, except that OIED may give priority to an eligible applicant that is not located on or near the reservation of the one or more communities that were described in the application if OIED determines that:

(1) The location of the business incubator will not prevent the eligible applicant from providing quality business incubation services to Native businesses and Native entrepreneurs from the one or more reservation communities to be served; and

(2) Siting the business incubator in the identified location will serve the interests of the one or more reservation communities to be served.
