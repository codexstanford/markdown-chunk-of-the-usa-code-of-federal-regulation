If the land is owned by the United States but not held in trust for an Indian tribe or individual Indian, the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall specify whether it wants to acquire fee title to the land or whether it wants the land to be held in trust for the benefit of a tribe.

(1) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit with its request a resolution of support from the governing body of the Indian tribe in which the beneficial ownership is to be registered.

(2) If the request is submitted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for land under the jurisdiction of that Secretary, the Secretary shall take all necessary steps to effect a transfer of the land to the Secretary of the Interior and shall also forward the Indian tribe or tribal organization's request and the tribe's resolution.

(3) The Secretary of the Interior shall expeditiously process all requests in accordance with applicable Federal law and regulations.

(4) The Secretary shall not require the Indian tribe or tribal organization to furnish any information in support of a request other than that required by law or regulation.
