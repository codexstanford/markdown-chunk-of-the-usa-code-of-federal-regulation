####### § 162.420 How much monetary compensation must be paid under a business lease of tribal land?

(a) A business lease of tribal land may allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe, and we will defer to the tribe and not require a valuation if the tribe submits a tribal authorization expressly stating that it:

(1) Has negotiated compensation satisfactory to the tribe;

(2) Waives valuation; and

(3) Has determined that accepting such negotiated compensation and waiving valuation is in its best interest.

(b) The tribe may request, in writing, that we determine fair market rental, in which case we will use a valuation in accordance with § 162.422. After providing the tribe with the fair market rental, we will defer to a tribe's decision to allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe.

(c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, we will require that the lease provide for fair market rental based on a valuation in accordance with § 162.422.
