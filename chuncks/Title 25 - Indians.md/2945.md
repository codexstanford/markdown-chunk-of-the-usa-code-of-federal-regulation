####### § 162.320 How much rent must be paid under a residential lease of tribal land?

(a) A residential lease of tribal land may allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe, and we will defer to the tribe and not require a valuation, if:

(1) The lease is for housing for public purposes; or

(2) The tribe submits a signed certification or tribal authorization stating that it has determined the negotiated amount to be in its best interest.

(b) The tribe may request, in writing, that we determine fair market rental, in which case we will use a valuation in accordance with § 162.322. After providing the tribe with the fair market rental, we will defer to a tribe's decision to allow for any payment amount negotiated by the tribe.

(c) If the conditions in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are not met, we will require that the lease provide for fair market rental based on a valuation in accordance with § 162.322.
