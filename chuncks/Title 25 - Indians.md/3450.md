(a) The purpose of continuing education and training is to establish a program to provide for the ongoing education and training of natural resources and agriculture personnel employed by approved organizations. This program will emphasize continuing education and training in three areas:

(1) Orientation training including tribal-federal relations and responsibilities;

(2) Technical agriculture education; and

(3) Developmental training in agriculture-based enterprises and marketing.

(b) We will maintain an orientation program to increase awareness and understanding of Indian culture and its effect on natural resources management and agriculture practices and on federal laws that effect natural resources management and agriculture operations and administration in the Indian agriculture program.

(c) We will maintain a continuing technical natural resources and agriculture education program to assist natural resources managers and agriculture-related professionals to perform natural resources and agriculture management on Indian land.

(d) We will maintain an agriculture land-based enterprise and marketing training program to assist with the development and use of Indian and Alaska Native agriculture resources.
