The Assistant Secretary can designate or modify service areas for a tribe. If you are a tribe requesting a service area designation, you must submit each of the following:

(a) A tribal resolution that certifies that:

(1) All eligible Indians residing within the service area will be served; and

(2) The proposed service area will not include counties or parts thereof that have reasonably available comparable services.

(b) Additional documentation showing that:

(1) The area is administratively feasible (that is, an adequate level of services can be provided to the eligible Indians residing in the area.);

(2) No duplication of services exists; and

(3) A plan describing how services will be provided to all eligible Indians can be implemented.

(c) Documentation should be sent to the Regional Director or Office of Self-Governance.

The Director or office will evaluate the information and make recommendations to the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary can make a determination to approve or disapprove and publish notice of the designation of service area and the Indians to be served in theTribes currently providing services are not required to request designation for service areas unless they make a decision to modify their existing service areas.
