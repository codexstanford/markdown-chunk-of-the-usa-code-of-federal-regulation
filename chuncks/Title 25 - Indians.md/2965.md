(a) Unless the lease provides otherwise, the lessee must notify all Indian landowners of the proposed amendment.

(b) The Indian landowners, or their representatives under § 162.013, must consent to an amendment of a residential lease in the same percentages and manner as a new residential lease under § 162.012, unless the lease:

(1) Provides that individual Indian landowners are deemed to have consented if they do not object in writing to the amendment within a specified period of time following Indian landowners' receipt of the amendment and the lease meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;

(2) Authorizes one or more representatives to consent to an amendment on behalf of all Indian landowners; or

(3) Designates us as the Indian landowners' representative for the purposes of consent to an amendment.

(1) A copy of the executed amendment or other documentation of any Indian landowners' actual consent;

(2) Proof of mailing of the amendment to any Indian landowners who are deemed to have consented; and

(3) Any other pertinent information for review.

(d) Unless specifically authorized in the lease, a written power of attorney, or a court document, Indian landowners may not be deemed to have consented to, and an Indian landowner's designated representative may not negotiate or consent to, an amendment that would:

(1) Reduce the payment obligations to the Indian landowners;

(2) Increase or decrease the lease area; or

(3) Terminate or change the term of the lease.
