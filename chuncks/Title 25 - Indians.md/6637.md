##### § 700.121 Statement of the basis for the determination of fair market value.

At the time of the initiation of negotiations to acquire the habitations and/or improvements, the Commission shall furnish the owner, along with the initial written purchase offer, a written statement of the basis for the determination of fair market value. To the extent permitted by the Commission, the statement shall include the following-

(a) A description and location identification of the habitations and/or improvements to be acquired.

(b) An inventory identifying the buildings, structures, fixtures, and other improvements, including appurtenant removable building equipment, which are considered to be part of the habitations and/or improvements for which the offer of fair market value is made.

(c) A recital of the amount of the offer and a declaration that such amount-

(1) Is the full amount believed by the Commission to be just compensation for the property and is not less than the fair market value of the property as determined on the basis of the appraisal(s);

(2) Does not reflect any relocation payments or other relocation assistance which the owner is entitled to receive.

(d) If only a portion of a habitation and/or improvement is to be acquired, an apportionment of the total estimated just compensation for the partial acquisition will be made. In the event that the Commission determines that partial acquisitions are necessary, all portions so acquired will be acquired simultaneously.
