(a) In the absence of actions or proceedings described in § 162.590(e), or if it is not appropriate for us to defer to the actions or proceedings, we will follow the procedures in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

(b) If we determine there has been a violation of the conditions of a WSR lease, other than a violation of payment provisions covered by paragraph (c) of this section, we will promptly send the lessee and any surety and mortgagee a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested.

(1) We will send a copy of the notice of violation to the tribe for tribal land, or provide constructive notice to Indian landowners for individually owned Indian land.

(iii) Request additional time to cure the violation.

(3) The notice of violation may order the lessee to cease operations under the lease.

(c) A lessee's failure to pay compensation in the time and manner required by a WSR lease is a violation of the lease, and we will issue a notice of violation in accordance with this paragraph.

(1) We will send the lessees and any surety and mortgagee a notice of violation by certified mail, return receipt requested:

(i) Promptly following the date on which payment was due, if the lease requires that payments be made to us; or

(ii) Promptly following the date on which we receive actual notice of non-payment from the Indian landowners, if the lease provides for payment directly to the Indian landowners.
