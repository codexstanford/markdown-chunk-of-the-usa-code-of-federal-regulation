(a) If an Indian adult does not cash his or her per capita check within twelve (12) months of the date the check was issued, the check will be canceled and the trust funds will be deposited into a "returned per capita account" where the funds will be maintained until we receive a request for disbursement by the Indian adult or for disposition by a tribe pursuant to § 115.820.
