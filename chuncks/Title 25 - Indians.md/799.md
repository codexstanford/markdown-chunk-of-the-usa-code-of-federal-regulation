#### PART 30 - STANDARDS, ASSESSMENTS, AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM
##### Subpart A - Standards, Assessments, and Accountability System Requirements
###### § 30.111 How will the Secretary implement requirements for an accountability system?

(a) The Secretary will define accountability system for BIE-funded schools consistent with this section and subpart C of this part, including provisions for a single Bureau-wide accountability system and system of support and improvement activities, taking into account the unique circumstances and needs of BIE-funded schools and the students served by BIE-funded schools.

(b) To improve student academic achievement and school success among all elementary and secondary schools within the BIE-funded school system, the Secretary will develop and implement a single, Bureau-wide accountability system that:

(1) Is based on the Bureau's challenging academic standards and academic assessments;

(2) Is informed by ambitious long-term goals and measurements of interim progress;

(3) Includes all the accountability indicators described paragraph (e) of this section;

(4) Takes into account the achievement of all elementary and secondary school students within the BIE-funded school system;

(5) Is the same accountability system used to annually, meaningfully differentiate all schools within the BIE-funded school system and the same accountability system used to identify schools for comprehensive and targeted support and improvement; and

(6) Includes the process that the Bureau will use to ensure effective development and implementation of school support and improvement plans, including evidence-based interventions, to hold all schools within the BIE-funded school system accountable for student academic achievement and school success.

(c) The inclusion of science and tribal civics will be phased into the Secretary's requirements for accountability system starting as a school quality or student success indicator and their continued use in such manner will be revisited as the accountability system is implemented.

(d) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system, the BIE will establish long-term goals and measurements of interim progress that will include, at a minimum, improved academic achievement, as measured by proficiency on the Bureau's annual assessments in mathematics and reading or language arts under § 30.105(b)(5)(i), and high school graduation rates, including the four (4)-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, or at BIE's discretion one or more extended year graduation cohorts, and that will:

(1) Use the same multi-year length of time for all students and for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system to meet the goals; and

(2) Take into account, for subgroups of students who are behind on the measurements of academic achievement and high school graduations rates, the improvement necessary to make significant progress in closing Bureau-wide proficiency and graduation rate gaps.

(e) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students within the BIE-funded school system, the BIE will include a long-term goal and measurements of interim progress for increases in the percentage of English learner students making progress in achieving English language proficiency as defined by the Secretary and measured by the assessments under § 30.110 within a timeline determined by the Bureau.

(f) For all students and separately for each subgroup of students the Bureau will establish and annually measure the following accountability indicators:

(1) For all schools, based upon the long-term goals established under paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section, academic achievement:

(i) As measured by proficiency on the annual assessments of mathematics and reading or language arts described in § 30.105(b)(5)(i); and

(ii) At the BIE's discretion, for each high school, growth, as measured by such annual assessments.

(2) For elementary and secondary schools that are not high schools:

(i) A measure of student growth, if determined to be appropriate by the BIE; or

(ii) Another valid and reliable Bureau-wide academic indicator that allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance.

(3) For high schools, based upon the long-term goals established under paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section:

(i) The four (4)-year adjusted cohort graduation rate; and

(ii) At the BIE's discretion, the extended-year adjusted graduation cohort rate, as defined in paragraph (j) of this section.

(4) For all schools, progress in achieving English language proficiency, as defined by the BIE and measured by the assessments of English language proficiency described in § 30.110, within a BIE-determined timeline for all English learners:

(i) In each of grades three (3) through eight (8); and

(ii) In the high school grade for which such English learners are otherwise assessed in mathematics and reading or language arts.

(5) For all schools, not less than one indicator of school quality or student success that:

(i) Allows for meaningful differentiation in school performance;

(ii) Is valid, reliable, comparable, and Bureau-wide (with the same indicator or indicators used for each grade span, as such term is determined by the BIE); and

(iii) May include one or more of the following measures:

(A) Student or Educator engagement;

(B) Chronic absenteeism;

(C) Student access to and completion of advanced coursework;

(D) Postsecondary readiness;

(E) School climate and safety; and

(F) Any other indicator the BIE chooses that meets the requirements of this section.

(g) The BIE will establish a system for meaningfully differentiating, annually, all schools that will:

(1) Be based on all indicators described paragraph (f) of this section for all students and for each subgroup of students; and

(2) With respect to paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, afford:

(i) Substantial weight to each such indicator;

(ii) In the aggregate, much greater weight than is afforded to the indicator or indicators utilized by the BIE and described in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, in the aggregate; and

(iii) Include differentiation of any such school in which any subgroup of students is consistently underperforming, as determined by the BIE, based on all indicators described in paragraph (f) of this section.

(h) Based on the system of meaningful differentiation described in paragraph (g) of this section, the BIE will establish a methodology to identify:

(1) Beginning with the first full school year following April 27, 2020, and at least once every three (3) years thereafter, one (1) BIE-wide category of schools for comprehensive support and improvement, which will include:

(i) Not less than the lowest-performing five (5) percent of all schools receiving Title I funding;

(ii) All high schools failing to graduate one third () or more of their students; and

(iii) All schools identified for additional targeted support and improvement that receive ESEA Title I funding and do not meet exit criteria as provided in § 30.124(a)(2).

(2) The BIE will provide technical assistance to all schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement, targeted support and improvement, or additional targeted support.

(i) The Bureau's accountability system will annually measure the achievement of at least ninety-five (95) percent of all students, and ninety-five (95) percent of each subgroup of students, who are enrolled in a school within the BIE-funded school system on the Bureau's assessments. The denominator for the purpose of measuring, calculating, and reporting on the academic achievement indicator will be the greater of:

(1) Ninety-five (95) percent of all students, or ninety-five (95) percent of each subgroup of students; or

(2) The number of students participating in the assessments.

(j) The performance of students that have not attended the same BIE-funded school for at least half () of a school year will not be included in the academic achievement, other academic, progress in achieving English language proficiency, or school quality or student success indicators for that school year, but will be used for the purpose of reporting on the Bureau and school report cards for that school year.

(k) Extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate means the fraction-

(1) The denominator of which consists of the number of students who form the original cohort of entering first-time students in grade nine (9) enrolled in the high school, adjusted by-

(i) Adding the students who joined that cohort, after the date of the determination of the original cohort; and

(ii) Subtracting only those students who left that cohort, after the date of the determination of the original cohort, as described in paragraph (l) of this section; and

(2) The numerator of which-

(i) Consists of the sum of-

(A) The number of students in the cohort, as adjusted under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, who earned a regular high school diploma before, during, or at the conclusion of-
