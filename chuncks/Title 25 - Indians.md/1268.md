If a student is enrolled, is in attendance during any of the first 10 days of school, and receives at least 5 days' instruction, the student is deemed to be enrolled all 10 days and shall be counted for ADM purposes. The first 10 days of school, for purposes of this section, are determined by the calendar that the school submits to OIEP.

(b) Except as provided in § 39.210, to be counted for ADM, a student dropped under § 39.209 must:

(1) Be re-enrolled; and

(2) Receive a full day of instruction from the school.
