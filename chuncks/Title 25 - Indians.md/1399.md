#### PART 41 - GRANTS TO TRIBAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND DIN&#xC9; COLLEGE
##### Subpart B - Tribal Colleges and Universities
###### § 41.35 What will happen if the Tribal college or university doesn't receive its appropriate share?

(a) If the BIE determines the Tribal college or university has received financial assistance to which the Tribal college or university was not entitled, BIE will:

(1) Promptly notify the Tribal college or university; and

(2) Reduce the amount of the Tribal college's or university's payments under this subpart to compensate for any overpayments or otherwise attempt to recover the overpayments.

(b) If a Tribal college or university has received less financial assistance than the amount to which the Tribal college or university was entitled, the Tribal college or university should promptly notify the BIE. If the BIE confirms the miscalculation, BIE will adjust the amount of the Tribal college's or university's payments for the same or subsequent academic years to compensate for the underpayments. This adjustment will come from the Department's general funds and not from future appropriated funds.
