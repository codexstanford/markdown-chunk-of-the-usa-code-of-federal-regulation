### PART 51 - CONCESSION CONTRACTS
#### Subpart G - Leasehold Surrender Interest
##### § 51.63 When a new concessioner pays a prior concessioner for a leasehold surrender interest, what is the leasehold surrender interest in the related capital improvements for purposes of a new concession contract?

A new leasehold surrender interest concession contract awarded to a new concessioner will require the new concessioner to pay the prior concessioner its leasehold surrender interest value in existing capital improvements as determined under § 51.62. The new concessioner upon payment will have a leasehold surrender interest in the related capital improvements on a unit-by-unit basis under the terms of the new leasehold surrender interest contract. Instead of initial construction cost, the initial value of such leasehold surrender interest will be the leasehold surrender interest value that the new concessioner was required to pay the prior concessioner.
