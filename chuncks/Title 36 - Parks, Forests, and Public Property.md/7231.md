###### § 1202.58 How are appeals processed?

(a) Upon receipt of your appeal, the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official will consult with the system manager, legal counsel, and such other officials as may be appropriate. If the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official determines that the records you requested are not exempt from release, NARA grants you access and so notifies you.

(b) If the NARA Privacy Act Appeal Official determines that your appeal must be rejected, NARA will immediately notify you in writing of that determination. This decision is final and cannot be appealed further within NARA. NARA's notification to you will include:

(1) The reason for the rejection of the appeal; and

(2) Notice of your right to seek judicial review of NARA's final determination, as described in 36 CFR 1202.84.

(c) NARA will make its final determination no later than 30 workdays from the date on which NARA receives your appeal. NARA may extend this time limit by notifying you in writing before the expiration of the 30 workdays. This notification will include an explanation of the reasons for the time extension.
