##### § 292.48 Grazing activities.

The following standards and guidelines apply to domestic livestock grazing activities on Other Lands, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and Wilderness Lands in the HCNRA.

(a) Grazing may be authorized only on rangeland determined by the authorized officer to be suitable for grazing and meeting or moving towards satisfactory condition and meeting the conditions described in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Where domestic livestock grazing is incompatible with the protection, restoration, or maintenance of fish and wildlife or their habitats; public outdoor recreation; conservation of scenic, wilderness, and scientific values; rare combinations of outstanding ecosystems, or the protection and enhancement of the values for which a wild and scenic river was designated, the livestock use shall be modified as necessary to eliminate or avoid the incompatibility. In the event an incompatibility persists after the modification or modification is not feasible, the livestock use shall be terminated.

(c) Range improvements must be designed and located to minimize their impact on scenic, cultural, fish and wildlife, and other resources in the HCNRA.
