(1) A statement of the purpose for requesting the records; and

(2) Certification that the records will be used only for statistical purposes.

(c) Upon receipt of your request, NARA will verify your right to obtain access to documents pursuant to § 1202.60. Upon verification, the system manager will make the requested records available to you.

(d) If NARA determines that the disclosure is not permitted under § 1202.60, the system manager will deny your request in writing. NARA will inform you of the right to submit a request for review of the denial and a final determination to the appropriate NARA Privacy Act Appeal Officer.
