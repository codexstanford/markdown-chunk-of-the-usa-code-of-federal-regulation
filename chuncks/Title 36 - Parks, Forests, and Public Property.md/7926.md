##### § 1237.16 How do agencies store audiovisual records?

Agencies must maintain appropriate storage conditions for permanent, long-term temporary or unscheduled audiovisual records:

(a) Ensure that audiovisual records storage facilities comply with 36 CFR part 1234.

(b) For the storage of permanent, long-term temporary, or unscheduled records, use audiovisual storage containers or enclosures made of non-corroding metal, inert plastics, paper products and other safe materials recommended in ISO 18902 and ISO 18911 (both incorporated by reference, see § 1237.3);

(c) Store originals and use copies (e.g., negatives and prints) separately, whenever practicable. Store distinct audiovisual record series separately from textual series (e.g., store poster series separately from other kinds of agency publications, or photographic series separately from general reference files). Retain intellectual control through finding aids, annotations, or other descriptive mechanisms;

(d) Store series of permanent and unscheduled x-ray films, i.e, x-rays that are not interspersed among paper records (case files), in accordance with § 1238.20 of this subchapter. Store series of temporary x-ray films under conditions that will ensure their preservation for their full retention period, in accordance with ANSI/PIMA IT9.11-1993 (incorporated by reference, see § 1237.3);

(e) Store posters and similar graphic works in oversize formats, in map cases, hanging files, or other enclosures that are sufficiently large or flexible to accommodate the records without rolling, folding, bending, or other ways that compromise image integrity and stability; and

(f) Store optical disks in individual containers and use felt-tip, water-based markers for disk labeling.
