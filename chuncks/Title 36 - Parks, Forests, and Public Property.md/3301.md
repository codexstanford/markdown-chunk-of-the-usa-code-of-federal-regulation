###### § 228.63 Removal under terms of a timber sale or other Forest Service contract.

In carrying out programs such as timber sales that involve construction and maintenance of various physical improvements, the Forest Service may specify that mineral materials be mined, manufactured, and/or processed for incorporation into the improvement. Where the mineral material is located on National Forest lands and is designated in the contract calling for its use, no permit is required as long as an operating plan as described in § 228.56 is required by the contract provisions. Title to any excavated material in excess of that needed to fulfill contract requirements revests in the United States without reimbursement to the contract holder or to agents or representatives of the contract holder. Such excess material may be disposed of under §§ 228.58, 228.59, or 228.62.
