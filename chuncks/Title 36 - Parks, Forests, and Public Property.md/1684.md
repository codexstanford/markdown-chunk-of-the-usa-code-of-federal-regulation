### PART 51 - CONCESSION CONTRACTS
#### Subpart E - Right of Preference to a New Concession Contract
##### § 51.32 What is the process if the Director determines that the best responsive proposal was not submitted by a preferred offeror?

If the Director determines that a proposal other than the responsive proposal submitted by a preferred offeror is the best proposal submitted for a qualified concession contract, then the Director must advise the preferred offeror of the better terms and conditions of the best proposal and permit the preferred offeror to amend its proposal to match them. An amended proposal must match the better terms and conditions of the best proposal as determined by the Director. If the preferred offeror duly amends its proposal within the time period allowed by the Director, and the Director determines that the amended proposal matches the better terms and conditions of the best proposal, then the Director must select the preferred offeror for award of the contract upon the amended terms and conditions, subject to other applicable requirements of this part.
