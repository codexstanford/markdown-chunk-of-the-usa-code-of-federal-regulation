##### § 51.80 How will the Director establish franchise fees for multiple outfitter and guide concession contracts in the same park area?

If the Director awards more than one outfitter and guide concession contract that authorizes or requires the concessioners to provide the same or similar visitor services at the same approximate location or utilizing the same resource within a single park area, the Director will establish franchise fees for those concession contracts that are comparable. In establishing these comparable franchise fees, the Director will take into account, as appropriate, variations in the nature and type of visitor services authorized by particular concession contracts, including, but not limited to, length of the visitor experience, type of equipment utilized, relative expense levels, and other relevant factors. The terms and conditions of an existing concession contract will not be subject to modification or open to renegotiation by the Director because of the award of a new concession contract at the same approximate location or utilizing the same resource.
