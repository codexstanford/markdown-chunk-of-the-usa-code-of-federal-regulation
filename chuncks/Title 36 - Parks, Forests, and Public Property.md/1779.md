##### § 51.98 What records must the concessioner keep and what access does the Director have to records?

A concessioner (and any subconcessioner) must keep any records that the Director may require for the term of the concession contract and for five calendar years after the termination or expiration of the concession contract to enable the Director to determine that all terms of the concession contract are or were faithfully performed. The Director and any duly authorized representative of the Director must, for the purpose of audit and examination, have access to all pertinent records, books, documents, and papers of the concessioner, subconcessioner and any parent or affiliate of the concessioner (but with respect to parents and affiliates, only to the extent necessary to confirm the validity and performance of any representations or commitments made to the Director by a parent or affiliate of the concessioner).
