####### § 1254.60 What are NARA's copying services?

(a) You may order copies of many of our documents for a fee. Our fee schedule for copies is located in § 1258.12 of this chapter. Exceptions to the fee schedule are located in § 1258.4. See § 1258.6 about reproductions NARA may provide without charging a fee.

(b) For preservation reasons, we do not make copies from the original documents if the documents are available on microfilm and a clear copy (electrostatic, photographic, or microfilm) can be made from the microfilm.
