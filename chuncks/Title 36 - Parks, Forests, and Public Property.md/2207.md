#### § 78.3 Federal Agency decision to waive responsibilities.

(b) Waiver under § 78.3(a) shall not exceed the period of time during which the emergency circumstances necessitating the waiver exist.

(c) In no event shall a Federal Agency Head delay an emergency action necessary to the preservation of human life or property for the purpose of complying with the requirements in section 110 of the Act.
