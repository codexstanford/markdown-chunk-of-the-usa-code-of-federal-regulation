###### § 1256.56 Information that would invade the privacy of a living individual.

(a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6), NARA will withhold records in personnel and medical and similar files containing information about a living individual that reveals details of a highly personal nature that, if released, would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Privacy information may include, but is not limited to, information about the physical or mental health or the medical or psychiatric care or treatment of the individual, and that:

(1) Contains personal information not known to have been previously made public, and

(2) Relates to events less than 75 years old.

(b) The Archivist of the United States may determine that this general restriction does not apply to:

(1) Specific records because enough time has passed that the privacy of living individuals is not compromised; or

(2) Researchers for the purpose of biomedical and social science research when such researchers have provided NARA with adequate written assurance that the record(s) will be used solely as a research or reporting record and that no individually identifiable information will be disclosed.
