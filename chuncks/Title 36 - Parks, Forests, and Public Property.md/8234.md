##### Subpart C - Access to Donated Historical Materials
###### § 1256.30 How do I obtain access to donated historical materials?

NARA encourages researchers to confer about donated historical materials with the appropriate director or reference staff member at the facilities listed in part 1253 of this chapter. Some donated historical materials have restrictions on their use and availability as stated in writing by the donors in the Donor's Deed of Gift. Some may have other restrictions imposed by statute or Executive Order. If warranted, the Archivist may apply general restrictions to donated materials even when not specified in the donor's deed of gift. NARA staff can assist you with questions about restrictions or copyright protection that may apply to donated materials. See § 1256.36 for information on appealing closure of donated materials and subpart D of this part for information about general restrictions.
