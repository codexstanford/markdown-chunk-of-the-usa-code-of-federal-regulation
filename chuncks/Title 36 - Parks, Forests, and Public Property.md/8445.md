(a) We are authorized to charge fees for occasional, non-official use of NARA public areas, as well as for services related to such use, including additional cleaning, security, and other staff services. We will either exercise this authority directly, or through the Foundation or an authorized Presidential library foundation or support organization.

(b) Federal and quasi-Federal agencies, and state, local, and tribal governmental institutions using public space for official government functions pay fees for the costs of room rental, administrative fees, additional cleaning, security, and other staff services NARA provides.

(c) You will be informed in advance and in writing of the total estimated cost associated with using the public area of interest. If we collect the fees directly, you will pay the National Archives Trust Fund. If the Foundation collects the fees, you will pay the National Archives Foundation. If a Presidential library foundation collects the fees, they will inform you where to submit the payment.
