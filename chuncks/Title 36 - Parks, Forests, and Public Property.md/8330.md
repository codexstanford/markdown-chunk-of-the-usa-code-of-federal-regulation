(c) The Presidential Libraries will work directly with agencies to facilitate the review of records exempted at the file series level.

(d) The Presidential Libraries, through the NDC, will establish a prioritization schedule for review of previously exempted classified materials in the Presidential Library system. These materials will be referred to agencies holding equity in the records via the RAC Project.
