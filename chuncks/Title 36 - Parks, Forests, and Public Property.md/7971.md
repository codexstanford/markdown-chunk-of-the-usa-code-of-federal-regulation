Agencies must:

(a) Follow the procedures in part 1235 of this subchapter and the additional requirements in this section.

(b) If the records are not in a NARA Federal Records Center, submit the information specified in § 1232.14(c) of this subchapter.

(c) Transfer the silver gelatin original (or duplicate silver gelatin microform created in accordance with § 1238.14) plus one microform copy.

(e) Package non-silver copies separately from the silver gelatin original or silver duplicate microform copy and clearly label them as non-silver copies.
