#### § 18.9 When may the Director lease property without issuing a request for bids or a request for proposals?

The Director, except as provided in this section, may not lease property without issuing a request for bids or a request for proposals in compliance with § 18.7 or § 18.8. The Director under this part may enter into leases with non-profit organizations (recognized as such by the Internal Revenue Service) or units of government without complying with §§ 18.7 or 18.8 if the Director determines that the non-profit or governmental use of the property will contribute to the purposes and programs of the park area. All other requirements of this part are applicable to leases entered into or to be entered into under authority of this section. The Director may enter into leases under this part with a term of sixty (60) days or less without complying with §§ 18.7 or 18.8 if the Director determines that to do so is in the best interests of the administration of the park area. If historic land is to be leased under the authority of this section, the Director must comply with 36 CFR part 800 (commenting procedures of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation) before entering into the lease.
