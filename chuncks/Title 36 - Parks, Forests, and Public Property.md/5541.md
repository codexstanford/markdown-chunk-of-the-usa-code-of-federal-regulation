#### § 903.6 Appeal of initial denial of access.

(a) After receiving notification of an initial denial of access to a record, an individual may request a review and reconsideration of the request by the Executive Director of the Corporation, or an officer of the Corporation designated by him, but other than the Privacy Protection Officer. Appeals for review shall be in writing, addressed to the Executive Director, Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Suite 1220 North, Washington, DC 20004. The appeal shall identify the record as in the original request, shall indicate the date of the original request and the date of the initial denial, and shall indicate the expressed basis for the denial.

(b) Not later than 30 days after receipt of an appeal, the Executive Director, or an officer of the Corporation designated by him, will complete review of the appeal and the initial denial and either:

(1) Determine that the appeal should be granted, and notify the individual in writing to that effect; or,

(2) Determine that the appeal should be denied because the information requested is exempt from disclosure. If the reviewing official denies the appeal, he or she shall advise the individual in writing of the decision and the reasons for reaching it, and that the denial of the appeal is a final agency action entitling the individual to seek judicial review in the appropriate district court of the United States as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).
