(2) The potential adverse impacts on the identified resource values resulting from the proposed operations.

(c) A plan of operations will be approved if, in the judgment of the authorized officer, proposed operations are compatible, to the maximum extent feasible, with the protection of the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(1) The authorized officer will deem operations to be compatible if the plan of operations includes all feasible measures which are necessary to prevent or minimize potential adverse impacts on the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section and if the operations are conducted in accordance with the plan.

(2) In evaluating the feasibility of mitigating measures, the authorized officer shall, at a minimum, consider the following:

(i) The effectiveness and practicality of measures utilizing the best available technology for preventing or minimizing adverse impacts on the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

(ii) The long- and short-term costs to the operator of utilizing such measures and the effect of these costs on the long- and short-term economic viability of the operations.

(3) The authorized officer shall not require implementation of mitigating measures which would prevent the evaluation or development of any valid claim for which operations are proposed.

(1) If, in the judgment of the authorized officer, environmental impacts unforeseen at the time of approval of the existing plan may result in the incompatibility of the operations with the protection of the resource values identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or

(2) Upon request by the operator to use alternative technology and equipment capable of achieving a level of environmental protection equivalent to that to be achieved under the existing plan of operations.
