### PART 51 - CONCESSION CONTRACTS
#### Subpart F - Determining a Preferred Offeror
##### § 51.44 How will the Director determine if a concessioner was satisfactory for purposes of a right of preference?

To be a satisfactory concessioner for the purposes of a right of preference, the Director must determine that the concessioner operated satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of its applicable concession contract, including extensions of the contract. The Director will base this determination in consideration of annual evaluations made by the Director of the concessioner's performance under the terms of the applicable concession contract and other relevant facts and circumstances. The Director must determine that a concessioner did not operate satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of a concession contract if the annual evaluations of the concessioner made subsequent to May 17, 2000 are less than satisfactory for any two or more years of operation under the concession contract.
