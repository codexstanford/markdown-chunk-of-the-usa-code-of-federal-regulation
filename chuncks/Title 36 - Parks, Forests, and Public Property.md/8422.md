####### § 1280.30 Types of corrective action for prohibited behavior.

(a) Individuals who violate the provisions of this part are subject to:

(1) Being removed from the property or facility (for up to seven calendar days) and possible law enforcement notification;

(2) Being banned from NARA property or facilities;

(3) Arrest for trespass; and

(4) Any other corrective action a law or regulation prescribes.

(b) The Executive for Research Services, the Executive for Legislative Archives, Presidential Libraries, and Museum Services, the Executive for Agency Services, or the Director of the Security Management Division, may have the individual immediately removed and temporarily denied further access to the property or facility for up to seven calendar days.

(c) During this removal period, the Executive for Business Support Services renders a decision on whether the person should be banned from the specific facility from which they were removed, or all NARA property or facilities, for either a specific period of time or permanently. If the Executive decides to ban the person, they will issue a written decision and notify the affected NARA properties or facilities.

(d) Banning under this part includes automatic revocation of research privileges, notwithstanding the time periods set forth in 36 CFR 1254. Research privileges remain revoked until the ban is lifted, at which time the person who was banned may submit an application for new privileges.
