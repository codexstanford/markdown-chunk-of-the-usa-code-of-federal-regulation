The Chief of the Forest Service may authorize the acceptance of contributions from cooperators for the payment of expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of this section.

(c) When necessary for the protection of the forest or the conservation of animal life on refuges under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Chief of the Forest Service may sell, barter, exchange, or donate game and non-game animals. When the interests of game conservation will be promoted thereby, the Chief of the Forest Service may accept donations of game and non-game animals, game and non-game birds, and fish, or the eggs of birds and fish.
