#### § 1121.8 Appeal of an initial adverse agency determination on correction or amendment of the record.

An individual who disagrees with the refusal of the Administrative Officer to correct or to amend his or her record may submit a request for a review of such refusal to the Executive Director, ATBCB, 330 C Street, SW., Room 1010, Washington, DC 20202. The Executive Director will, not later than thirty (30) working days from the date on which the individual requests such review, complete such review and make final determination, unless, for good cause shown, the Executive Director extends such thirty-day period. If, after his or her review, the Executive Director also refuses to correct or to amend the record in accordance with the request, the Board shall permit the individual or authorized representative to file with the Executive Director a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of the Executive Director and shall notify the individual or authorized representative that he or she may seek judicial review of the Executive Director's determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A).
