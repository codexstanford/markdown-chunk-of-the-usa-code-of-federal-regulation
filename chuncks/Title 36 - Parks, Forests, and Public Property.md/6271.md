##### § 1120.37 A&TBCB action on appeals.

(a) The General Counsel must make one of the following legal determinations in connection with every appeal from the initial denial of a request for an existing, located record:

(1) The record must be disclosed;

(2) The record must not be disclosed because a statute or a provision of this part so requires; or

(3) The record is exempt from mandatory disclosure but legally may be disclosed as a matter of agency discretion.

(b) Whenever the General Counsel has determined under paragraph (a)(3) of this section that a record is exempt from mandatory disclosure but legally may be disclosed, the matter must be referred to the Executive Director. If the Executive Director determines that an important purpose would be served by withholding the record, the General Counsel shall issue a determination denying the appeal. If the Executive Director determines that no important purpose would be served by withholding the record, the General Counsel must disclose the record.

(c) The General Counsel may delegate his or her authority under this section to any other attorney employed by the A&TBCB in connection with any cateogory of appeals or any individual appeals.

(d) A determination denying an appeal from an initial denial must-

(1) Be in writing;

(2) State which of the exemptions in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) apply to each requested existing record;

(3) State the reason(s) for denial of the appeal;

(4) State the name and position of each A&TBCB officer or employee who directed that the appeal be denied; and

(5) State that the person whose request was denied may obtain de novo judicial review of the denial by complaint filed with the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4).
