(c) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;

(d) NARA has an interest in the decision that may be rendered in the legal proceeding;

(e) Allowing such testimony or production of records would assist or hinder NARA in performing its statutory duties;

(f) Allowing such testimony or production of records would involve a substantial use of NARA resources;

(h) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be in the best interest of NARA or the United States;

(i) The records or testimony can be obtained from the publicly available records of NARA or from other sources;

(j) The demand is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;

(k) Disclosure would violate a statute, Executive Order or regulation;

(l) Disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive, or privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential commercial or financial information, otherwise protected information, or information which would otherwise be inappropriate for release;

(m) Disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceeding, or compromise constitutional rights;

(n) Disclosure would result in NARA appearing to favor one litigant over another;

(o) Disclosure relates to documents that were created by another agency;

(p) A substantial Government interest is implicated;
