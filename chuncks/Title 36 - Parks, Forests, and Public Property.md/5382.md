## Chapter VIII - Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
### PART 805 - PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT
#### § 805.3 Applicability.

(a) These procedures apply to actions of the full Council and the Council staff acting on behalf of the full Council.

(b) The following actions are covered by these procedures:

(1) Recommendations for legislation.

(2) Regulations implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).

(3) Procedures implementing other authorities.

(4) Policy recommendations that do not require implementation by another Federal agency.

(c) In accordance with § 1508.4 of the NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1508.4), Council comments on Federal, federally assisted and federally licensed undertakings provided pursuant to section 106 of the NHPA and 36 CFR part 800 are categorically excluded from these procedures. This exclusion is justified because Federal agencies seeking the Council's comments under section 106 have the responsibility for complying with NEPA on the action they propose. The Council's role is advisory and its comments are to be considered in the agency decisionmaking process. Coordination between the section 106 and the NEPA processes is set forth in 36 CFR 800.9.
