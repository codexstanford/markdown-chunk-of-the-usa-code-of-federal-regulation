#### § 1004.4 Report of motor vehicle accident.

(a) The operator of a motor vehicle involved in an accident resulting in property damage, personal injury or death shall report the accident to the Executive Director as soon as practicable, but within 24 hours of the accident. If the operator is physically incapable of reporting the accident, an occupant of the vehicle shall report the accident to the Executive Director.

(b) A person shall not tow or move a vehicle that has been involved in an accident without first notifying the Executive Director unless the position of the vehicle constitutes a hazard or prior notification is not practicable, in which case notification shall be made before the vehicle is removed from the area administered by the Presidio Trust.

(c) Failure to comply with a reporting requirement specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section is prohibited.

(d) The notification requirements imposed by this section do not relieve the operator and occupants of a motor vehicle involved in an accident of the responsibility to satisfy reporting requirements imposed by State law.
