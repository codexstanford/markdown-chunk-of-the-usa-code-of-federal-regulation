(b) If NARA anticipates more than a 10 workday delay in making a record you requested available, NARA also will explain in the acknowledgment specific reasons for the delay.

(c) If your request for access does not contain sufficient information to permit the system manager to locate the records, NARA will request additional information from you. NARA will have 10 workdays following receipt of the additional information in which to make the records available or to acknowledge receipt of the request and to indicate when the records will be available.
