### PART 51 - CONCESSION CONTRACTS
#### Subpart J - Assignment or Encumbrance of Concession Contracts
##### § 51.92 What are standard proformas?

Concessioners are encouraged to submit standard prospective financial statements (proformas) pursuant to this part. A "standard proforma" is one that:

(a) Provides projections, including revenues and expenses that are consistent with the concessioner's past operating history unless the proforma is accompanied by a narrative that describes why differing expectations are achievable and realistic;

(b) Assumes that any loan related to an assignment or encumbrance will be paid in full by the expiration of the concession contract unless the proforma contains a narrative description as to why an extended loan period is consistent with an opportunity for reasonable profit over the remaining term of the concession contract. The narrative description must include, but is not limited to, identification of the loan's collateral after expiration of the concession contract; and

(c) Assumes amortization of any intangible assets assigned or encumbered as a result of the transaction over the remaining term of the concession contract unless the proforma contains a narrative description as to why such extended amortization period is consistent with an opportunity for reasonable profit over the remaining term of the concession contract.
