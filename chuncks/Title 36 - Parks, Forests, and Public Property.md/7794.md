(a) If any provisions of this part conflict with local or regional building codes, the following rules of precedence apply:

(1) Between differing levels of fire protection and life safety, the more stringent provision applies; and

(2) Between mandatory provisions that cannot be reconciled with a requirement of this part, the local or regional code applies.

(b) If any of the provisions of this part conflict with mandatory life safety or ventilation requirements imposed on underground storage facilities by 30 CFR chapter I, 30 CFR chapter I applies.

(c) NARA reserves the right to require documentation of the mandatory nature of the conflicting code and the inability to reconcile that provision with NARA requirements.
