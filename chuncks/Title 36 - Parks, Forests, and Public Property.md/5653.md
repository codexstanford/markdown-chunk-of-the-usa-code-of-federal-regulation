#### § 907.14 Corporation decision making procedures.

To ensure that at major decision making points all relevant environmental concerns are considered by the Decision Maker, the following procedures are established.

(a) An environmental document, i.e., the EIS, Environmental Assessment, Finding of No Signficant Impact, or Notice of Intent, in addition to being prepared at the earliest point in the decision making process, shall accompany the relevant proposal or action through the Corporation's decision making process to ensure adequate consideration of environmental factors.

(b) The decision maker shall consider in its decision making process only those decision alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents. Also, where an EIS has been prepared, the decision maker shall consider all alternatives described in the EIS. A written record of the consideration of alternatives during the decision making process shall be maintained.

(c) Any environmental document prepared for a proposal or action shall be made part of the record of any formal rulemaking by the Corporation.
