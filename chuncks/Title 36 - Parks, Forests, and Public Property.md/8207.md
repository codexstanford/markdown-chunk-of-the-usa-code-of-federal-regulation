(b) You must submit your request to use privately owned microfilm equipment four months in advance of the proposed starting date of the microfilming project.

(1) You may include in your request only one project to microfilm a complete body of documents, such as an entire series, a major continuous segment of a very large series which is reasonably divisible, or a limited number of separate series related by provenance or subject.

(2) We do not accept additional requests from an individual or organization to microfilm records in a NARA facility while we evaluate an earlier request from that individual or organization to microfilm records at that facility.

(3) We establish the number of camera spaces available to a single project based upon the total number of projects approved for filming at that time.
