### PART 902 - FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
#### Subpart B - General Administration
##### § 902.14 Deletion of nondiscloseable information from requested records.

Whenever a requested record contains information which falls within one of the exempted categories of subpart F of this part, identifying details shall be deleted from the record before it is made available for public inspection and copying. When a requested record contains both discloseable and nondiscloseable information, only that portion which is reasonably segregable after deletion of the nondiscloseable portions, will be released. If the information in the discloseable portion is readily available from another source and that source is made known to the person making the request, the Corporation need not disclose the requested record. In all cases where a deletion is made, an explanation of the deletion shall be attached to the record made available for inspection, distribution, or copying. Appeal of deletions shall be made in accordance with subpart H of this part.
