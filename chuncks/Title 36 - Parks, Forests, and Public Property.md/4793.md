(2) The effects of the water resources project will neither invade nor unreasonably diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish wildlife values of a Wild and Scenic River, when any portion of the project is located above, below, or outside the Wild and Scenic River, or;

(3) The effects of the water resources project will neither invade nor diminish the scenic, recreational, and fish and wildlife values of a Study River when the project is located above, below, or outside the Study River during the study period.
