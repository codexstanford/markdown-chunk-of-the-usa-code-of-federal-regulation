##### § 223.201 Limitations on unprocessed timber harvested in Alaska.

Unprocessed timber from National Forest System lands in Alaska may not be exported from the United States or shipped to other States without prior approval of the Regional Forester. This requirement is necessary to ensure the development and continued existence of adequate wood processing capacity in Alaska for the sustained utilization of timber from the National Forests which are geographically isolated from other processing facilities. In determining whether consent will be given for the export of timber, consideration will be given to, among other things, whether such export will:

(a) Permit more complete utilization on areas being logged primarily for local manufacture,

(b) Prevent loss or serious deterioration of logs unsalable locally because of an unforeseen loss of market,

(c) Permit the salvage of timber damaged by wind, insects, fire or other catastrophe,

(d) Bring into use a minor species of little importance to local industrial development, or

(e) Provide material required to meet urgent and unusual needs of the Nation. (16 U.S.C. 472a; 16 U.S.C. 551; 16 U.S.C. 616)
