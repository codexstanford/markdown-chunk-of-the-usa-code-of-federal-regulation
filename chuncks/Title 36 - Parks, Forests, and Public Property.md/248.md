(11) The site will receive less than 5 tons per day of solid waste, on an average yearly basis; and

(12) The proposed closure and post-closure care is sufficient to protect the resources of the National Park System unit from degradation.

(b) A person proposing to operate a solid waste disposal site that was not in operation on September 1, 1984, must submit a request for a permit to the proper Superintendent for review by Regional Director demonstrating that the solid waste operation meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. The following information must be included in a permit request:

(1) A map or maps, satisfactory to the Regional Director, that adequately shows the proposed area of solid waste disposal, size of the area in acres, existing roads and proposed routes to and from the area of operations and the location and description of surface facilities;

(2) The name and legal addresses of the following:

(i) Owners of record of the land; and

(ii) Any lessee, assignee or designee of the owner, if the proposed operator is not the owner of the land;

(ii) An assessment of hydrologic conditions of the disposal site with projections of leachate generation, composition, flow paths and discharge areas and geochemical fate of leachate constituents;

(iii) An analysis of the quantitative and qualitative extent to which natural and cultural resources will be affected based on acceptable and appropriate monitoring of existing resource conditions;

(iv) Steps to be taken by the operator to prevent degradation of air and water quality, to manage pests and vermin, and to minimize noise, odor, feeding by native wildlife and conflicts with visitor uses;

(v) An analysis of alternative locations and methods for the disposal of the solid waste; and

(vi) Any other information required by the Regional Director to effectively analyze the effects that the proposed solid waste disposal site may have on the preservation, management and public use of the unit.
