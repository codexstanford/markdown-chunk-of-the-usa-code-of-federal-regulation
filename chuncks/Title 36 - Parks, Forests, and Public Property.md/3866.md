Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (h) of this section, in conveyances of lands to the United States under authorized programs of the Forest Service, where owners reserve the right to occupy and use the land for the purposes of residence, agriculture, industry, or commerce, said reservations shall be subject to the following conditions, rules and regulations which shall be expressed in and made a part of the deed of conveyance to the United States and such reservations shall be exercised thereunder and in obedience thereto:

(a) Except when provided otherwise by statute, the reservation so created shall not be assigned, used, or occupied by anyone other than the grantor without the consent of the United States.

(b) All reasonable precautions shall be taken by the grantor and all persons acting for or claiming under him to prevent and suppress forest fires upon or threatening the premises or other adjacent lands of the United States, and any person failing to comply with this requirement shall be responsible for any damages sustained by the United States by reason thereof.

(c) The premises shall not be used or permitted to be used, without the written consent of the United States, for any purpose or purposes other than those specified in the instrument creating the reservation.

(d) The grantor and all persons acting for or claiming under him shall maintain the premises and all buildings and structures thereon in proper repair and sanitation and shall comply with the National Forest laws and regulations and the laws and lawful orders of the State in which the premises are located.

(e) Except when provided otherwise by statute, the reservation shall terminate: (1) Upon the expiration of the period named in the deed; (2) upon failure for a period of more than one calendar year to use and occupy the premises for the purposes named in the deed; (3) by use and occupancy for unlawful purposes or for purposes other than those specified in the deed; and (4) by voluntary written relinquishment by the owner.

(f) Upon the termination of the reservation the owners of personal property remaining on the premises shall remove same within a period of three months, and all such property not so removed shall become the property of the United States except that when such removal is prevented by conditions beyond the control of the owners the period shall be extended in writing by the Forest Service to allow a reasonable time for said removal, but in no event longer than one year.

(g) The said reservation shall be subject to rights-of-way for the use of the United States or its permittees, upon, across, or through the said land, as may hereafter be required for the erection, construction, maintenance and operation of public utility systems over all or parts thereof, or for the construction and maintenance of any improvements necessary for the good administration and protection of the National Forests, and shall be subject to the right of officials or employees of the Forest Service to inspect the premises, or any part thereof, at all reasonable times and as often as deemed necessary in the performance of official duties in respect to the premises.

(h) The conditions, rules, and regulations set forth in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section shall not apply to reservations contained in conveyances of lands to the United States under the Act of March 3, 1925, as amended (43 Stat. 1133, 64 Stat. 82; 16 U.S.C. 555).
