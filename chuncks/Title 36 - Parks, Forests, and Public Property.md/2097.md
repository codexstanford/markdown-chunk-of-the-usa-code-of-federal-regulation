### PART 72 - URBAN PARK AND RECREATION RECOVERY ACT OF 1978
#### Subpart B - Local Recovery Action Programs
##### § 72.17 Preliminary Action Program - commitments to be included.

Local governments may submit a Preliminary Action Program during the initial interim period in lieu of a full Action Program. The Preliminary Action Program must include a firm commitment by the local government to complete and adopt a full Action Program by October 1, 1980. This commitment must include a schedule for the development of the full Recovery Action Program. The schedule should outline the activities which will be undertaken, the anticipated time frame for the development and completion of these activities, and the resources of people, money and support services necessary for the development and completion of the Recovery Action Program. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions concerning the use of the Preliminary Action Program, local governments are encouraged to prepare, adopt and submit as soon as possible a full Action Program which complies with the provisions of §§ 72.11, 72.12, and 72.13. Local governments which have already made a commitment to park and recreation systems by establishing ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation and maintenance programs may use these as a starting point for meeting Action Program requirements.
