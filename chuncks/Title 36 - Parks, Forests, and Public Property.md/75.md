The basis for denial shall be provided to the applicant upon request.

(e) The superintendent shall include in a permit the terms and conditions that the superintendent deems necessary to protect park resources or public safety and may also include terms or conditions established pursuant to the authority of any other section of this chapter.

(f) A compilation of those activities requiring a permit shall be maintained by the superintendent and available to the public upon request.
