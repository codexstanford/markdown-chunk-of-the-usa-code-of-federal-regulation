(i) Give notice to the person receiving the unprocessed private timber that exporting that timber would violate the Act and its implementing regulations;

(v) Acknowledge that failure to completely and accurately report and identify unprocessed timber is a violation of the Act, and regulations issued under the Act, and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001); and

(vi) Certify that the form has been read and understood.

(2) On such form, described in paragraph (b), the person acquiring the timber shall:

(v) Agree to send a signed copy of the transaction statement to the Regional Forester within 10 calendar days of the transaction;

(vi) Agree to allow authorized officials access to log storage and processing facilities for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the Act and its implementing regulations;

(vii) Acknowledge that failure to comply with the domestic manufacturing requirements for unprocessed timber or failure to notify subsequent persons of this requirement may subject the certifier to the civil penalties and administrative remedies provided in the Act and regulations issued under the Act;

(viii) Acknowledge that failure to completely and accurately report and identify unprocessed timber is a violation of the Act, and regulations issued under the Act, and the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. 1001); and

(ix) Certify that the form has been read and understood.
