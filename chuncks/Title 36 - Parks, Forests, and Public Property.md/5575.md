##### § 905.735-401 Standards.

Section 3(c)(8) of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation Act of 1972, Pub. L. 92-578, 86 Stat. 1267 (40 U.S.C. 872(c)(8)) specifies that the eight members appointed to the Board by the President from private life, at least four of whom shall be residents of the District of Columbia, "shall have knowledge and experience in one or more fields of history, architecture, city planning, retailing, real estate, construction or government." As a result of these prerequisites for appointment of a private member to the Board of Directors, conflicts could arise for these Board Members as the Corporation proceeds with various development activities. Accordingly, Board Members should perform their responsibilities for the operation and management of the Corporation consistent with these regulations, and other applicable Federal laws and regulations, and consistent with the highest level of fiduciary responsibility.
