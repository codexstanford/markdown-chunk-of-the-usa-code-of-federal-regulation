###### § 9.73 If I don't need an operations permit, are there still requirements that I must meet?

(a) You must notify the NPS within 30 days if the methods or the environmental conditions of your downhole operations materially change.

(1) Federally owned or administered lands, waters, or resources of System units;

(2) NPS visitor uses or experiences; or

(3) Visitor or employee health or safety.

(c) Within 30 days after receiving this notification, you must file your operations permit application with the Superintendent.
