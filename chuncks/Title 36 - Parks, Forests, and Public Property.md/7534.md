###### § 1220.32 What records management principles must agencies implement?

Agencies must create and maintain authentic, reliable, and usable records and ensure that they remain so for the length of their authorized retention period. A comprehensive records management program provides policies and procedures for ensuring that:

(a) Records documenting agency business are created or captured;

(b) Records are organized and maintained to facilitate their use and ensure integrity throughout their authorized retention periods;

(c) Records are available when needed, where needed, and in a usable format to conduct agency business;

(d) Legal and regulatory requirements, relevant standards, and agency policies are followed;

(e) Records, regardless of format, are protected in a safe and secure environment and removal or destruction is carried out only as authorized in records schedules; and

(f) Continuity of operations is supported by a vital records program (see part 1223 of this subchapter).
