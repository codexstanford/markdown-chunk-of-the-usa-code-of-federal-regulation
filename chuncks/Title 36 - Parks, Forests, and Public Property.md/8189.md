####### § 1254.50 Does NARA consider reinstating research privileges?

(a) You have 30 calendar days after the date of revocation to appeal the action in writing and seek reinstatement of research privileges. Mail your appeal to: Deputy Archivist of the United States, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001.

(b) The Deputy Archivist has 30 calendar days from receipt of an appeal to decide whether to reinstate your research privileges and to respond to you in writing.

(c) If the Deputy Archivist upholds the revocation of privileges or if you do not appeal, you may request in writing reinstatement of research privileges no earlier than 180 calendar days from the date we revoked privileges. This request may include application for a new researcher identification card.

(d) Our reinstatement of research privileges applies to all research rooms.

(e) If we reinstate your research privileges, we issue you a card for a probationary period of 60 days. At the end of the probationary period, you may apply for a new, unrestricted identification card, which we issue to you if your conduct during the probationary period follows the rules of conduct in this part and in part 1280 of this chapter.
