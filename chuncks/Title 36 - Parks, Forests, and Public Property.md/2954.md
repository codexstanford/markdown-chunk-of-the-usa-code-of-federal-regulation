###### § 223.43 Limitation on amounts of transferred purchaser credit.

(a) The amount of purchaser credit which may be transferred into a given sale shall be limited to the difference between remaining current contract value and the total of:

(1) Remaining base rate value needs,

(2) Salvage sale fund needs plus sale area improvement needs in excess of base rate value needs, and

(3) Total purchaser credit limit on the given sale.

(b) This calculation shall be made as of the date of sale award for sales made on or after January 1, 1978. For sales made prior to January 1, 1978, the calculation shall be made as of December 31, 1977, except that if the amount actually transferred in as of December 31, 1977, exceeds the calculated limit, the actual transfers as of that date shall be the established limit. Purchaser credit earned on a sale and subsequently transferred out may be replaced without regard to the transfer in limit. Sale area improvement needs shall be based on the original sale area betterment plan or revisions thereto approved prior to July 1, 1976. Salvage sale fund needs shall be based on the original salvage sale fund plan.
