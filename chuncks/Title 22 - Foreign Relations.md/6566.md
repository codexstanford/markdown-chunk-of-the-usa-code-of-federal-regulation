### PART 910 - MISCELLANEOUS
#### § 910.4 Confidentiality; Record of grievances awarded.

(a) To the maximum extent practicable, the Board will make every effort to preserve the confidentiality of the identity of the grievant or charged employee.

(b) The records of the Board shall be maintained by the Board under appropriate safeguards to preserve confidentiality and shall be separate from all records of the Agencies; provided, however, that records of all grievances awarded in favor of the Grievant in which the grievance concerns gross misconduct by a supervisor shall be separately maintained by the Board and the procedures regarding confidentiality and disclosure of such records shall be as provided in section 1107(e) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, as amended; and provided further, that the Board shall not make a finding of gross misconduct without first providing the supervisor whose conduct is at issue notice and an opportunity to respond.
