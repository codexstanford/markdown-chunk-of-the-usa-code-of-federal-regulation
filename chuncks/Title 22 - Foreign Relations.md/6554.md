### PART 908 - REMEDIES
#### § 908.1 Board orders.

If the Board finds that a grievance is meritorious, the Board shall have the authority to direct the Agency:

(a) To correct any official personnel record relating to the grievant which the Board finds to be inaccurate or erroneous, to have an omission, or to contain information of a falsely prejudicial character;

(b) To reverse a decision denying the grievant compensation or any other perquisite of employment authorized by laws or regulations when the Board finds that such decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to laws or regulations;

(c) To retain in the Service a member whose separation would be in consequence of the matter by which the member is aggrieved;

(d) To reinstate the grievant, and to grant the grievant back pay, where it is established that the separation or suspension without pay of the employee was unjustified or unwarranted under the Back Pay Act (5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(1));

(e) To take any corrective action deemed appropriate by the Board provided it is not contrary to law or collective bargaining agreement.
