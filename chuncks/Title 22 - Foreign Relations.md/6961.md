## Chapter XI - International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico, United States Section
### PART 1104 - PROTECTION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES
#### § 1104.11 Relationship to section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.

Issuance of a permit in accordance with the Act and this part does not constitute an undertaking requiring compliance with section 106 of the Act of October 15, 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470f). However, the mere issuance of such a permit does not excuse the Commissioner from compliance with section 106 where otherwise required.
