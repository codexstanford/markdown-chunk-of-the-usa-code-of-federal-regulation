#### PART 99 - REPORTING ON CONVENTION AND NON-CONVENTION ADOPTIONS OF EMIGRATING CHILDREN
##### § 99.2 Reporting requirements for adoption cases involving children emigrating from the United States.

(a) Once the Convention has entered into force for the United States, an agency (including an accredited agency and temporarily accredited agency), person (including an approved person), public domestic authority, or other adoption service provider providing adoption services in a case involving the emigration of a child from the United States must report information to the Secretary in accordance with this section if it is identified as the reporting provider in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) In a Convention case in which an accredited agency, temporarily accredited agency, or approved person is providing adoption services, the primary provider is the reporting provider. In any other Convention case, or in a non-Convention case, the reporting provider is the agency, person, public domestic authority, or other adoption service provider that is providing adoption services in the case, if it is the only provider of adoption services. If there is more than one provider of adoption services in a non-Convention case, the reporting provider is the one that has child placement responsibility, as evidenced by the following factors:

(1) Entering into placement contracts with prospective adoptive parent(s) to provide child referral and placement;

(2) Accepting custody from a birthparent or other legal guardian for the purpose of placement for adoption;

(3) Assuming responsibility for liaison with a foreign government or its designees with regard to arranging an adoption; or

(4) Receiving information from, or sending information to a foreign country about a child that is under consideration for adoption.

(c) A reporting provider, as identified in paragraph (b) of this section, must report the following identifying information to the Secretary for each outgoing case within 30 days of learning that the case involves emigration of a child from the United States to a foreign country:

(1) Name, date of birth of child, and place of birth of child;

(2) The U.S. State from which the child is emigrating;

(3) The country to which the child is immigrating;

(4) The U.S. State where the final adoption is taking place, or the U.S. State where legal custody for the purpose of adoption is being granted and the country where the final adoption is taking place; and

(5) Its name, address, phone number, and other contact information.

(d) A reporting provider, as identified in paragraph (b) of this section, must report any changes to information previously provided as well as the following milestone information to the Secretary for each outgoing case within 30 days of occurrence:

(1) Date case determined to involve emigration from the United States (generally the time the child is matched with adoptive parents);

(2) Date of U.S. final adoption or date on which custody for the purpose of adoption was granted in United States;

(3) Date of foreign final adoption if custody for purpose of adoption was granted in the United States, to the extent practicable; and

(4) Any additional information when requested by the Secretary in a particular case.
