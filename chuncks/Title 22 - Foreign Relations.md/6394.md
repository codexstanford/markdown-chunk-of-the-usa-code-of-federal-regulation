(a) Except in cases under paragraph (c) of this section, when a record pertaining to an individual is required to be disclosed by court order, DFC will make reasonable efforts to provide notice of this to the individual. If DFC cannot locate the individual, notice will be deemed sufficient for this part if it is mailed to the individual's last known address. The notice will contain a copy of the order and a description of the information disclosed.

(b) Notice will be given within a reasonable time after DFC's receipt of the order, unless the order is not a matter of public record. In those cases, the notice will be given only after the order becomes public.

(c) Notice is not required if disclosure is made from an exempt system of records.
