##### § 213.33 Permitted actions after termination of collection activity.

Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. Termination does not preclude the agency from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:

(a) Selling the debt if the CFO determines that such sale is in the best interests of USAID;

(b) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;

(c) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or

(d) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.
