##### § 136.5 Chief of mission policies, rules or procedures.

(a) Each chief of mission shall establish a procedure under which employees may request approval for the sale of personal property and for conversion of proceeds of such sale from local currency into U.S. dollars, if applicable. This procedure may be modified to meet local conditions, but must produce a documentary record to be held by the post of the following:

(1) The employee's signed request for permission to sell personal property, and, if applicable, to convert local currency proceeds to U.S. dollars;

(2) A description of each item of personal property having more than minimal value, and the cost basis and actual sales price for each item;

(3) All profits received and whether profit is retainable;

(4) Donation to charities or other authorized recipients of non-retainable profits;

(5) Approvals to sell and, if applicable, to exchange proceeds, with any restrictions or refusals of the employee's request noted, signed by the chief of mission or designee; and

(6) For privately owned vehicle transactions, data on purchaser and statement that customs requirements have been met and title has been transferred or arranged with an agent identified on document.

(b) In order to ensure that due account is taken of local conditions, including applicable laws, markets, exchange rate factors, and accommodation exchange facilities, the chief of mission to each foreign country is authorized to establish policies, rules, and procedures governing the disposition of personal property by employees and family members in that country under the chief of mission's jurisdiction. Policies, rules and procedures issued by the chief of mission shall be consistent with the general restrictions set forth in § 136.4 and may include at least the following:

(1) Identification of categories of dispositions (e.g., sales of minimal value items) that may be made without prior written approval;

(2) Identification of categories of individuals or entities to whom sales of personal property can be made without restrictions on profits (e.g., other employees, third country diplomats), individuals or entities to whom sales can be made but profits not retained, and individuals or entities to whom sales may not be made;

(3) Requirements to report the total estimated and actual proceeds for all minimal value items, even if such items are otherwise exempted from limitations on profits of sale;

(4) Categories of items of personal property excluded from restrictions on disposition because generally exempt from taxation and import duties under local law;

(5) More restrictive definition of "minimal value" (see § 136.3(h) of this part);

(6) Limitations on manner of disposition (e.g., restrictions on advertising or yard sales);

(7) Limitations on total proceeds that may be generated by dispositions of personal property, including limitations on proceeds from disposition of "minimal value" items;

(8) Limitations on total profits that may be generated by dispositions of personal property, including limitations on profits from dispositions of "minimal value" items;

(9) Limitations on total proceeds from dispositions of personal property that may be converted into dollars by reverse accommodation exchange;

(10) Limitations on the timing and number of reverse accommodation exchanges permitted for proceeds of dispositions of personal property (e.g., only in last six months of tour and no more than two exchange conversions);

(11) Designation of bona fide charitable foreign entities to whom an employee or family member may donate profits that cannot be retained under these regulations.

(12) Designation of post officials authorized to approve on behalf of chief of mission employee requests for permission to sell personal property and requests to convert local currency proceeds of sale to U.S. dollars by reverse accommodation exchange.

(c) All policies, rules, and procedures that are issued by the chief of mission pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be announced by notice circulated to all affected mission employees and copies of all such policies, rules and procedures shall be made readily accessible to all affected employees and family members.

(d) Violations of restrictions or requirements established by a chief of mission in policies, rules, or procedures issued by a chief of mission pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be grounds for disciplinary actions against the employee in accordance with the employing agency's procedures and regulations. Employees shall ensure compliance by family members with policies, rules or procedures issued by the chief of mission.
