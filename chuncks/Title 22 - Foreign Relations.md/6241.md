(c) The ALJ shall promptly serve the initial decision on all parties within 90 days after the time for submission of post-hearing briefs and reply briefs (if permitted) has expired.

If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline contained in this paragraph, he or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the delay and shall set a new deadline.

(d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the Director, or a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision is timely filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the Director and shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued by the ALJ.
