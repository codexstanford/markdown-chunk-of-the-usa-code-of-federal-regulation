##### § 124.11 Congressional certification pursuant to Section 36(d) of the Arms Export Control Act.

(a) The Arms Export Control Act requires that a certification be provided to the Congress prior to the granting of any approval of a manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement for the manufacturing abroad of any item of significant military equipment that is entered into with any country regardless of dollar value. Additionally, any manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement providing for the export of major defense equipment shall also require a certification when meeting the requirements of § 123.15 of this subchapter.

(b) Unless an emergency exists which requires the immediate approval of the agreement in the national security interests of the United States, approval may not be granted until at least 15 calendar days have elapsed after receipt by the Congress of the certification required by 22 U.S.C. 2776(d)(1) involving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, any member country of that Organization, or Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, or the Republic of Korea or at least 30 calendar days have elapsed for any other country. Approvals may not be granted when the Congress has enacted a joint resolution prohibiting the export.

(c) Persons who intend to export defense articles and defense services pursuant to any exemption in this subchapter under the circumstances described in this section and section 123.15 must provide written notification to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and include a signed contract and a DSP-83 signed by the applicant, the foreign consignee and the end-user.
