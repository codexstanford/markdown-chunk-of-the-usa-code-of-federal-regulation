##### § 1006.740 Are suspension proceedings formal?

(a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposition.

(b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.
