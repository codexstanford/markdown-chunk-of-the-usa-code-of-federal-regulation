### PART 1506 - COLLECTION OF CLAIMS
#### Subpart D - Compromise of Debts
##### § 1506.31 May USADF reduce or negotiate a claim amount?

USADF may compromise claims for money or property where the principal balance of a claim, excluding interest, penalty and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000. Where the claim exceeds $100,000, the authority to accept the compromise rests solely with DOJ. The CFO may reject an offer of compromise in any amount. Where the claim exceeds $100,000, USADF may refer the claim to DOJ for approval with a recommendation to accept an offer of compromise. The referral will be in the form of a Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) and will outline the basis for USADF's recommendation.
