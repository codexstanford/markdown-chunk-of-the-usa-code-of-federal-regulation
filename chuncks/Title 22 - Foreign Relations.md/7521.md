### PART 1506 - COLLECTION OF CLAIMS
#### Subpart E - Suspension or Termination of Collection Action
##### § 1506.40 What actions by the Agency are permitted after termination of collection activity?

Termination ceases active collection of a debt. However, termination does not preclude the Agency from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:

(a) Selling the debt if the CFO determines that such sale is in the best interests of USADF;

(b) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;

(c) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or

(d) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.
