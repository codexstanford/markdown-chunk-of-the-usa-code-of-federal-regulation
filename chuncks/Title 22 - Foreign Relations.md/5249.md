#### § 240.5 Non-impairment of the Guarantee.

After issuance of a Guarantee, that Guarantee will be an unconditional, full faith and credit obligation of the United States of America, and will not be affected or impaired by any subsequent condition or event.

Moreover, the Guarantee shall not be affected or impaired by:

(a) Any defect in the authorization, execution, delivery or enforceability of any agreement or other document executed by a Noteholder, USAID, the Fiscal Agent or the Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Guarantee; or

(b) The suspension or termination of the program pursuant to which USAID is authorized to guarantee the Eligible Notes.
