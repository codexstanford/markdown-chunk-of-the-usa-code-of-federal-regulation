###### § 62.62 Termination of, or denial of redesignation for, a class of designated programs.

The Department may, in its sole discretion, determine that a class of designated programs compromises the national security of the United States or no longer furthers the public diplomacy mission of the Department of State. Upon such a determination, the Office shall:

(a) Give all sponsors of such class of designated programs not less than thirty (30) days' written notice of the revocation of Exchange Visitor Program designations for such programs, specifying therein the grounds and effective date for such revocations; or

(b) Give any sponsor of such class of designated programs not less than thirty (30) days' written notice of its denial of the sponsor's application for redesignation, specifying therein the grounds for such denial and effective date of such denial. Revocation of designation or denial of redesignation on the above-specified grounds for a class of designated programs is the final decision of the Department.
