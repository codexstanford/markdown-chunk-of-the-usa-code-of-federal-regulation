###### § 140.14 Special procedures for U.S. entities and individuals.

(a) If the Country Narcotics Coordinator makes a preliminary decision that evidence exists to justify withholding, suspending, or terminating assistance to a U.S. entity, U.S. citizen, or permanent U.S. resident, the matter shall be referred immediately to the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs for appropriate action, to be taken in consultation with the agency proposing the assistance and the agency or agencies that provided information reviewed or relied upon in making the preliminary decision.

(b) If a determination is made that assistance is to be withheld, suspended, or terminated under this part, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, or the Assistant Secretary's designee, shall notify the affected U.S. entity, U.S. citizen, or permanent U.S. resident and provide such entity or individual with an opportunity to respond before action is taken. In no event, shall this part be interpreted to create a right to classified information or law enforcement investigatory information by such entity or individual.
