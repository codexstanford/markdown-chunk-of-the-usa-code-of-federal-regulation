#### PART 123 - LICENSES FOR THE EXPORT AND TEMPORARY IMPORT OF DEFENSE ARTICLES
##### § 123.10 Non-transfer and use assurances.

(a) A nontransfer and use certificate (Form DSP-83) is required for the export of significant military equipment and classified articles, including classified technical data. A license will not be issued until a completed Form DSP-83 has been received by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. This form is to be executed by the foreign consignee, foreign end-user, and the applicant. The certificate stipulates that, except as specifically authorized by prior written approval of the Department of State, the foreign consignee and foreign end-user will not reexport, resell or otherwise dispose of the significant military equipment enumerated in the application outside the country named as the location of the foreign end-use or to any other person.

(b) The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may also require a DSP-83 for the export of any other defense articles, including technical data, or defense services.

(c) When a DSP-83 is required for an export of any defense article or defense service to a non-governmental foreign end-user, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may require as a condition of issuing the license that the appropriate authority of the government of the country of ultimate destination also execute the certificate.
