###### § 18.8 Institution of proceeding.

Whenever the Director General determines that there is sufficient reason to believe that any former officer or employee of the Department has violated 18 U.S.C. 207(a), (b) or (c), he/she may institute an administrative disciplinary proceeding. The proceeding may be for that person's suspension from practice before the Department or for some lesser penalty. The proceeding shall be instituted by a complaint which names the respondent and is signed by the Director General and filed in his/her office. Except in cases of willfulness, or where time, the nature of the proceeding, or the public interest does not permit, a proceeding will not be instituted under this section until facts or conduct which may warrant such action have been called to the attention of the proposed respondent in writing and he/she has been accorded the opportunity to provide his/her position on the matter.
