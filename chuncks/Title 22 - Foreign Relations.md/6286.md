###### § 706.2 Policy.

It is DFC's policy to make its records available to the public to the greatest extent possible, in keeping with the spirit of the FOIA. This policy includes providing reasonably segregable information from records that also contain information that may be withheld under the FOIA. However, implementation of this policy also reflects DFC's view that the soundness and viability of many of its programs depend in large measure upon full and reliable commercial, financial, technical and business information received from applicants for DFC assistance and that the willingness of those applicants to provide such information depends on DFC's ability to hold it in confidence. Consequently, except as provided by law and in this part, information provided to DFC in confidence will not be disclosed without the submitter's consent.
