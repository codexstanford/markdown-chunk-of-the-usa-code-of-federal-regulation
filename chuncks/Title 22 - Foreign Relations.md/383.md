(a) Refunds of amounts representing payroll deductions such as for any retirement and disability fund;

(b) Amounts due deceased, incompetent, or insolvent persons including payees or bona fide holders of unpaid Government checks;

(c) Amounts claimed from the Government when questions of fact affect either the amount payable or the terms of payment, when for any reason settlement cannot or should not be affected at the Foreign Service office; and
