(b) Each such committee established after January 5, 1973, shall terminate not later than two years after its establishment, unless it is renewed by the A.I.D. Administrator prior to its termination date.

(c) Any committee which is renewed shall continue for not more than two years unless, prior to the expiration of that period, it is renewed.

(d) Renewal requires advance approval of the Administrator in accordance with section 5(c) which requires application of the criteria set forth in section 5(b) of the Act; notification to the OMB Secretariat not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days before the expiration date, and concurrence by the Secretariat; publication of a notice of the renewal; and the filing of a new advisory committee charter with the appropriate House and Senate Committees and to the Library of Congress.

(e) Notification to the OMB Secretariat shall include:

(1) The A.I.D. Administrator's determination that renewal is necessary and is in the public interest;

(2) The reasons for his determination;

(3) The Agency's plan to attain or maintain balanced membership of the committee; and

(4) An explanation of why the committee's functions cannot be performed by the Agency or by an existing advisory committee.
