##### § 1506.41 Can the Agency collect against a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy?

USADF will generally terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy regardless of the amount.

The CFO will seek legal advice from the General Counsel's office if s/he believes that any claims or offsets may have survived the discharge of a debtor.
