###### Notification to a principal.

(a)Whenever PER/ER/RET receives from a former spouse or other eligible beneficiary-

(1) a court order which it deems qualified that requires payment to the beneficiary; or

(2) A final decree of divorce which it deems valid together with a request for a pro rata share payment-PER/ER/RET will send a copy of the document to the principal and a notice stating: (i) That PER/ER/RET deems the order qualified or the divorce decree valid, (ii) that payments will be made from the principal's account to the beneficiary and the effective date of such payments, (iii) the effect of such payments on the principal's retirement benefit. In the case of any court order with retroactive or immediate effect, and in the case of pro rata share payments, the amounts will be withheld from future payments to the principal but will not be paid to the beneficiary for 30 days from the notice date in order to give the principal an opportunity to contest the court order or the validity of the divorce.
