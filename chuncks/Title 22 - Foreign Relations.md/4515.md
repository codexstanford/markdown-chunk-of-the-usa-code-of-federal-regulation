#### § 223.2 Report of violations.

On receipt of information regarding a possible violation of the statutory or regulatory post-employment restrictions by a former employee and after determining that such information does not appear to be frivolous, the General Counsel shall provide such information to the Director of the Office of Government Ethics and to the Criminal Division, Department of Justice. Any investigation or administrative action shall be coordinated with the Department of Justice to avoid prejudicing possible criminal proceedings. If the Department of Justice informs the Agency that it does not intend to institute criminal proceedings, such coordination shall no longer be required and the General Counsel is free to decide whether to pursue administrative action.
