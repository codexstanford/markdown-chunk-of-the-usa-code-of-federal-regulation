### PART 1007 - SALARY OFFSET
#### § 1007.7 Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.
##### The Inter-American Foundation as the creditor agency.

(a)(1) When the President determines that an employee of another federal agency owes a delinquent debt to the Inter-American Foundation, the President shall as appropriate:

(i) Arrange for a hearing upon the proper petitioning by the employee;

(ii) Certify to the paying agency in writing that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt accrued, and that Foundation regulations for salary offset have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;

(iii) If collection must be made in installments, the President must advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment;

(iv) Advise the paying agency of the actions taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and provide the dates on which action was taken unless the employee has consented to salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of procedures required by law. The written consent or acknowledgment must be sent to the paying agency;

(v) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Foundation must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, notify the employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of the employee's separation to the Inter-American Foundation. If the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or similar payments, it must certify to the agency responsible for making such payments the amount of the debt and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1108 have been followed; and

(vi) If the employee has already separated and all the payments due from the paying agency have been paid, the President may request unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by administrative offset.
