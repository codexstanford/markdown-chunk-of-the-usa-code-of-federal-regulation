## Chapter XV - African Development Foundation
### PART 1508 - GOVERNMENTWIDE DEBARMENT AND SUSPENSION (NONPROCUREMENT)
#### Subpart B - Covered Transactions
##### § 1508.220 Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

(a) Covered transactions under this part-

(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).

(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 1508.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

(2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) ADF official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

(3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.
