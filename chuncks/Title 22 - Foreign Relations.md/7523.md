### PART 1506 - COLLECTION OF CLAIMS
#### Subpart F - Discharge of Indebtedness and Reporting Requirements
##### § 1506.42 Under what circumstances will USADF discharge a delinquent debt?

Before discharging a delinquent debt, USADF will make a determination that collection action is no longer warranted and request that litigation counsel release any liens of record securing the debt. Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. When collection action on a debt is suspended or terminated, the debt remains delinquent and further collection action may be pursued at a later date in accordance with the standards set forth in this part. When a debt is discharged in full or in part, further collection action is prohibited and USADF must terminate all debt collection activities.
