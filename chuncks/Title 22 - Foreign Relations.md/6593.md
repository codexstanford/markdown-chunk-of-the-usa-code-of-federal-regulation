(7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authority by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the Inter-American foundation specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;
