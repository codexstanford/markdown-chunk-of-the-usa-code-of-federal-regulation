#### Subpart A - General Provisions
##### § 213.3 Other remedies.

(a) This part does not supersede or require the omission or duplication of administrative proceedings required by contract, statute, or regulation (e.g., resolution of audit findings under grants or contracts; or appeal provisions under grants or contracts).

(b) The remedies and sanctions available to the Agency under this part for collecting debts are not intended to be exclusive. The Agency may impose, where authorized, other appropriate sanctions upon a debtor for inexcusable, prolonged or repeated failure to pay a debt. For example, the Agency may stop doing business with a grantee, contractor, borrower or lender; convert the method of payment under a grant or contract from an advance payment to a reimbursement method; or revoke a grantee's or contractor's letter-of-credit.
