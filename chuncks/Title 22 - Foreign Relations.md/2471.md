#### PART 123 - LICENSES FOR THE EXPORT AND TEMPORARY IMPORT OF DEFENSE ARTICLES
##### § 123.25 Amendments to licenses.

(a) The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls may approve an amendment to a license for permanent export, temporary export and temporary import of unclassified defense articles. A suggested format is available from the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.

(b) The following types of amendments to a license will be considered: Addition of U.S. freight forwarder or U.S. consignor; change due to an obvious typographical error; change in source of commodity; and change of foreign intermediate consignee if that party is only transporting the equipment and will not process (e.g., integrate, modify) the equipment. For changes in U.S. dollar value see § 123.23.

(c) The following types of amendments to a license will not be approved: Additional quantity, changes in commodity, country of ultimate destination, end-use or end-user, foreign consignee and/or extension of duration. The foreign intermediate consignee may only be amended if that party is acting as freight forwarder and the export does not involve technical data. A new license is required for these changes. Any new license submission must reflect only the unshipped balance of quantity and dollar value.
