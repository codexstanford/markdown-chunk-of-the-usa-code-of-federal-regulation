##### § 23.8 Misrepresentation as to products containing more than one precious metal.
###### i.e.,

(a) It is unfair or deceptive to misrepresent the relative quantity of each precious metal in a product that contains more than than one precious metal. Marketers should list precious metals in the order of their relative weight in the product from greatest to least (leading with the predominant metal). Listing precious metals in order of relative weight is not necessary where it is clear to reasonable consumers from context that the metal listed first is not predominant.

(b) The following are examples of markings or descriptions that may be misleading:

(1) Use of the terms "Platinum + Silver" to describe a product that contains more silver than platinum by weight.

(2) Use of the terms "14K/Sterling" to describe a product that contains more silver than gold by weight.

(c) The following are examples of markings and descriptions that are not considered unfair or deceptive:

(1) For a product comprised primarily of silver with a surface-layer application of platinum, "900 platinum over silver."

(2) For a product comprised primarily of silver with visually distinguishable parts of gold, "14k gold-accented silver."

(3) For a product comprised primarily of gold with visually distinguishable parts of platinum, "850 Platinum inset, 14K gold ring."
