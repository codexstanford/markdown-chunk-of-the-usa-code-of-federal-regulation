###### § 1112.53 Can the CPSC immediately withdraw its acceptance of the accreditation of a third party conformity assessment body?

(a) When it is in the public interest to protect health and safety, and notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the CPSC may withdraw immediately and temporarily its acceptance of a third party conformity assessment body's accreditation for any portion of its CPSC scope while the CPSC pursues an investigation and potential adverse action under § 1112.51.

(1) For purposes of this part, "in the public interest to protect health and safety" means that the CPSC has credible evidence that:

(i) The integrity of test(s) being conducted under a scope for which the CPSC has accepted the third party conformity assessment body's accreditation, have been affected by undue influence or otherwise interfered with or compromised; and

(ii) The scope for which the CPSC has accepted the third party conformity assessment body's accreditation involve a product(s) which, if noncompliant with CPSC rules, bans, standards, and/or regulations, constitutes an imminently hazardous consumer product under section 12 of the CPSA.

(2) When presented with an allegation that, if credible, would result in immediate and temporary withdrawal of CPSC acceptance of a third party conformity assessment body's accreditation, the investigation and adverse action procedures described in § 1112.51 apply, except that instead of the timeframes described in § 1112.51, the following timeframes will apply when the CPSC pursues immediate and temporary withdrawal:

(i) The Initial Notice will generally inform the third party conformity assessment body that it has 7 calendar days to respond.

(ii) An administrative appeal of a Final Notice of immediate and temporary withdrawal will be timely if filed within 7 calendar days of the date of the Final Notice.

(b) If the third party conformity assessment body is already the subject of an investigation or adverse action process under § 1112.51, the immediate and temporary withdrawal will remain in effect until: the agency communicates in writing that the immediate and temporary withdrawal has been lifted; the investigation concludes and the agency does not propose an adverse action; or the adverse action process concludes with denial, suspension, or withdrawal.

(c) If the third party conformity assessment body is not already the subject of an investigation or adverse action process under § 1112.51, an investigation under § 1112.51(a) will be launched based on the same information that justified the immediate and temporary withdrawal.
