### Subchapter B - Consumer Product Safety Act Regulations
#### PART 1145 - REGULATION OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO OTHER ACTS UNDER THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY ACT
##### § 1145.17 Multi-purpose lighters that can be operated by children; risks of death or injury.

(a) The Commission finds that it is in the public interest to regulate under the Consumer Product Safety Act any risks of injury associated with the fact that multi-purpose lighters can be operated by young children, rather than to regulate such risks under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act or the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970.

(b) Therefore, if the Commission finds regulation to be necessary, risks of death or injury that are associated with multi-purpose lighters because the lighters can be operated by young children shall be regulated under one or more provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act. Other risks that are associated with such lighters, and that are based solely on the fact that the lighters contain a hazardous substance, shall continue to be regulated under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.
