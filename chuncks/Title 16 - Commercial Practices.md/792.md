##### § 24.3 Misuse of the terms "waterproof," "dustproof," "warpproof," "scuffproof," "scratchproof," "scuff resistant," and "scratch resistant."

It is unfair or deceptive to:

(a) Use the term "Waterproof" to describe all or part of an industry product unless the designated product or material prevents water from contact with its contents under normal conditions of intended use during the anticipated life of the product or material.

(b) Use the term "Dustproof" to describe an industry product unless the product is so constructed that when it is closed dust cannot enter it.

(c) Use the term "Warpproof" to describe all or part of an industry product unless the designated product or part is such that it cannot warp.

(d) Use the term "Scuffproof," "Scratchproof," or other terms indicating that the product is not subject to wear in any other respect, to describe an industry product unless the outside surface of the product is immune to scratches or scuff marks, or is not subject to wear as represented.

(e) Use the term "Scuff Resistant," "Scratch Resistant," or other terms indicating that the product is resistant to wear in any other respect, unless there is a basis for the representation and the outside surface of the product is meaningfully and significantly resistant to scuffing, scratches, or to wear as represented.
