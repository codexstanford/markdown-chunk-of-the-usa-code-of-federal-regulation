##### § 20.2 Deception as to the identity of a rebuilder, remanufacturer, reconditioner, reliner, or other reworker.

(a) It is unfair or deceptive to misrepresent the identity of the rebuilder, remanufacturer, reconditioner, reliner or other reworker of an industry product.

(b) If the identity of the original manufacturer of an industry product, or the identity of the manufacturer for which the product was originally made, is revealed and the product was rebuilt, remanufactured, reconditioned, relined, or otherwise reworked by someone else, it is unfair or deceptive to fail to disclose such fact wherever the original manufacturer is identified in advertising or promotional literature concerning the industry product, on the container in which the product is packed, and on the product itself, in close conjunction with, and of the same permanency and conspicuousness as, the disclosure that the product is not new. Examples of such disclosures include:

(1) Disclosure of the identity of the rebuilder: "Rebuilt by John Doe Co."

(2) Disclosure that the industry product was rebuilt by an independent rebuilder: "Rebuilt by an Independent Rebuilder."

(3) Disclosure that the industry product was rebuilt by someone other than the manufacturer identified: "Rebuilt by other than XYZ Motors."

(4) Disclosure that the industry product was rebuilt for the identified manufacturer: "Rebuilt for XYZ Motors."
