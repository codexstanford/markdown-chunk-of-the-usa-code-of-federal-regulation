##### § 303.41 Use of fiber trademarks and generic names in advertising.

(a) In advertising textile fiber products, the use of a fiber trademark or a generic fiber name shall require a full disclosure of the fiber content information required by the Act and regulations in at least one instance in the advertisement.

(b) Where a fiber trademark is used in advertising textile fiber products containing more than one fiber, other than permissible ornamentation, such fiber trademark and the generic name of the fiber must appear in the required fiber content information in immediate proximity and conjunction with each other in plainly legible type or lettering of equal size and conspicuousness.

(c) Where a fiber trademark is used in advertising textile fiber products containing only one fiber, other than permissive ornamentation, such fiber trademark and the generic name of the fiber must appear in immediate proximity and conjunction with each other in plainly legible and conspicuous type or lettering at least once in the advertisement.

(d) Where a fiber trademark or generic name is used in non-required information in advertising, such fiber trademark or generic name, shall not be used in such a manner as to be false, deceptive, or misleading as to fiber content, or to indicate, directly or indirectly, that a textile fiber product is composed wholly or in part of a particular fiber, when such is not the case.
