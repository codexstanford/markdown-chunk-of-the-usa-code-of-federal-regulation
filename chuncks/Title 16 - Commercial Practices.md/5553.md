(2) Common matches, including book matches, wooden matches, and so-called "safety" matches are exempt from the labeling requirements of section 2(p)(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i)) insofar as they apply to the product being considered hazardous because of being an "extremely flammable solid" or "flammable solid" as defined in § 1500.3(c)(6)(v) and (vi).

(3) Paper items such as newspapers, wrapping papers, toilet and cleansing tissues, and paper writing supplies are exempt from the labeling requirements of section 2(p)(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i)) insofar as they apply to the products being considered hazardous because of being an "extremely flammable solid" or "flammable solid" as defined in § 1500.3(c)(6)(v) and (vi).

(4) Thread, string, twine, rope, cord, and similar materials are exempt from the labeling requirements of section 2(p)(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i)) insofar as they apply to the products being considered hazardous because of being an "extremely flammable solid" or "flammable solid" as defined in Sec. 1500.3(c)(6)(v) and (vi).
