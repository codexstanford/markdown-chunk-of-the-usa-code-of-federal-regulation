###### § 1500.270 Granting of authorization.

(a) When authorization contemplated by § 1500.269 is granted, the area office director shall notify the applicant in writing, specifying:

(1) The procedure to be followed:

(2) That the operations are to be carried out under the supervision of an officer of the Consumer Product Safety Commission or the Bureau of Customs, as the case may be;

(3) A time limit, reasonable in the light of the circumstances, for completion of the operations; and

(4) Such other conditions as are necessary to maintain adequate supervision and control over the article.

(b) Upon receipt of a written request for extension of time to complete such operations, containing reasonable grounds therefor, the area office director may grant such additional time as he deems necessary.

(c) An authorization may be amended upon a showing of reasonable grounds therefor and the filing of an amended application for authorization with the area office director.

(d) If ownership of a hazardous substance covered by an authorization changes before the operations specified in the authorization have been completed, the original owner will be held responsible, unless the new owner has executed a bond and obtained a new authorization. Any authorization granted under this section shall supersede and nullify any previously granted authorization with respect to the article.
