###### § 1211.6 General entrapment protection requirements.

(a) A residential garage door operator system shall be provided with inherent primary entrapment protection that complies with the requirements as specified in § 1211.7.

(b) In addition to the inherent primary entrapment protection as required by paragraph (a) of this section, a vertically moving residential garage door operator shall comply with one of the following:

(1) Shall be constructed to:

(i) Require constant pressure on a control intended to be installed and activated within line of sight of the door to lower the door;

(ii) Reverse direction and open the door to the upmost position when constant pressure on a control is removed prior to operator reaching its lower limit, and

(iii) Limit a portable transmitter, when supplied, to function only to cause the operator to open the door;

(2) Shall be provided with a means for connection of an external secondary entrapment protection device as described in § 1211.8 (a) and (c) through (e), as applicable to vertically moving doors; or

(3)(i) Shall be provided with an inherent secondary entrapment protection device as described in §§ 1211.8(a) and (f), 1211.10, and 1211.12 and is:

(A) A combination sectional overhead garage door operator system as described in § 1211.6(c); and

(B) For use only with vertically moving garage doors.

(ii) With respect to § 1211.6(b)(3)(i)(A), trolley-driven operators do not meet the definition of a combination sectional overhead garage door operator system.

(c) In the case of a vertically moving combination sectional overhead garage door operator system, the door shall comply with the requirements in ANSI/DASMA 102 (incorporated by reference, see § 1211.40).

(d) In addition to the inherent primary entrapment protection as required by § 1211.6(a), a horizontally sliding residential garage door operator shall comply with one of the following:

(1) Shall be constructed to:

(i) Require constant pressure on a control to close the door;

(ii) Reverse direction and open the door a minimum of 2 in (50.8 mm) when constant pressure on a control is removed prior to operator reaching its position limit; and

(iii) Stop the door if a second obstruction is detected in the reverse direction.

(2) Shall be provided with a means for connection of an external secondary entrapment protection device for each leading edge as described in § 1211.8(c) through (e), as applicable to horizontally moving doors.

(e) A mechanical switch or a relay used in an entrapment protection circuit of an operator shall withstand 100,000 cycles of operation controlling a load no less severe (voltage, current, power factor, inrush and similar ratings) than it controls in the operator, and shall function normally upon completion of the test.

(f) In addition to complying with paragraph (e) of this section, in the event of a malfunction of a switch or relay (open or short) described in paragraph (c) of this section results in loss of any entrapment protection required by § 1211.7(a), § 1211.7(b)(7), § 1211.7(c)(7), § 1211.8(a), or § 1211.8(b), the door operator shall become inoperative at the end of the opening or closing operation, the door operator shall move the door to, and stay within, 1 foot (305 mm) of the uppermost position.
