#### PART 1117 - REPORTING OF CHOKING INCIDENTS INVOLVING MARBLES, SMALL BALLS, LATEX BALLOONS AND OTHER SMALL PARTS
##### § 1117.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this part is to set forth the Commission's interpretative regulations for reporting of choking incidents required by the Child Safety Protection Act. The statute requires that each manufacturer, distributor, retailer, and importer of a marble, small ball, or latex balloon, or a toy or a game that contains a marble, small ball, latex balloon, or other small part, shall report to the Commission any information obtained by such manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or importer which reasonably supports the conclusion that an incident occurred in which a child (regardless of age) choked on such a marble, small ball, or latex balloon or on a marble, small ball, latex balloon, or other small part contained in such toy or game and, as a result of that incident the child died, suffered serious injury, ceased breathing for any length of time, or was treated by a medical professional.
