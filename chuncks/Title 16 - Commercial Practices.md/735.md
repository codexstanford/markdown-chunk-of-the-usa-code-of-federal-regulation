#### PART 16 - ADVISORY COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT
##### § 16.14 Amendments.

(a) The charter of an advisory committee may be amended when the Commission determines that the existing charter no longer accurately describes the committee itself or its goals or procedures.

(1) To make a minor amendment to an advisory committee charter, the Commission shall:

(i) Amend the charter language as necessary; and

(ii) File the amended charter in accordance with the provisions of § 16.6 of this part.

(2) To make a major amendment to an advisory committee charter, the Commission shall:

(i) Amend the charter language as necessary;

(ii) Submit the proposed amended charter with a letter to the Administrator requesting concurrence in the amended language and an explanation of why the changes are essential and in the public interest; and

(iii) File the amended charter in accordance with the provisions of § 16.6 of this part.

(b) Amendment of an existing charter does not constitute renewal of the advisory committee under § 16.13 of this part.
