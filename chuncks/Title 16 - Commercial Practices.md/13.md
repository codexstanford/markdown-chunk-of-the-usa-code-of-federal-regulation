##### § 0.16 Bureau of Competition.

The Bureau is responsible for enforcing Federal antitrust and trade regulation laws under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12-27), and a number of other special statutes that the Commission is charged with enforcing. The Bureau carries out its responsibilities by investigating alleged law violations, recommending to the Commission such further steps as may be appropriate, and prosecuting enforcement actions authorized by the Commission. Such further steps may include seeking injunctive and other relief as permitted by statute in Federal district court; litigating before the agency's administrative law judges; negotiating settlement of complaints; and initiating rules or reports. The Bureau also conducts compliance investigations and, in compliance with Section 16(a)(1) of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. 56(a)(1)), initiates proceedings for civil penalties to assure compliance with final Commission orders dealing with competition and trade restraint matters. The Bureau's activities also include business and consumer education and staff advice on competition laws and compliance, and liaison functions with respect to foreign antitrust and competition law enforcement agencies and organizations, including requests for international enforcement assistance.
