(a) The CPSC staff will review each application and may contact the third party conformity assessment body with questions or to request submission of missing information.

(b) The application of a firewalled third party conformity assessment body will be accepted by order of the Commission, if the Commission finds that:

(1) Acceptance of the accreditation of the third party conformity assessment body would provide equal or greater consumer safety protection than the manufacturer's or private labeler's use of an independent third party third party conformity assessment body; and

(2) The third party conformity assessment body has established procedures to ensure that:

(i) Its test results are protected from undue influence by the manufacturer, private labeler, or other interested party;

(ii) The CPSC is notified immediately of any attempt by the manufacturer, private labeler, or other interested party to hide or exert undue influence over test results; and

(iii) Allegations of undue influence may be reported confidentially to the CPSC.

(c) The CPSC will communicate its decision on each application in writing to the applicant, which may be by electronic mail.
