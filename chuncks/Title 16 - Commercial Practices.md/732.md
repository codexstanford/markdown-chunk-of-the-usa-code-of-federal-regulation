(3) An evaluation of the substance of the committee's reports or recommendations with respect to the Commission's programs or operations;

(4) An evaluation (with emphasis on the preceding twelve month period of the committee's work) of the history of the Commission's utilization of the committee's recommendations in policy formulation, program planning, decision making, more effective achievement of program objectives, and more economical accomplishment of programs in general.

(5) Whether information or recommendations could be obtained from sources within the Commission or from another advisory committee already in existence;

(6) The degree of duplication of effort by the committee as compared with that of other parts of the Commission or other advisory committees; and
