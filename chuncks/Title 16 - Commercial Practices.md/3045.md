#### PART 1016 - POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR INFORMATION DISCLOSURE AND COMMISSION EMPLOYEE TESTIMONY IN PRIVATE LITIGATION
##### § 1016.1 Purpose and policy.

(a) The Commission's policy is to make official records available to private litigants, to the fullest extent possible.

(b) The Commission's policy and responsibility is to conserve the time of its employees for work on Commission projects and activities. Participation of Commission employees in private litigation, in their official capacities, is generally contrary to this policy and responsibility. In addition, such participation could impair the effectiveness of Commission employees as witness in litigation in which the Commission is directly involved.
