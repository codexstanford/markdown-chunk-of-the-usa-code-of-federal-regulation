##### § 1500.130 Self-pressurized containers: labeling.

(a) Self-pressurized containers that fail to bear a warning statement adequate for the protection of the public health and safety may be misbranded under the act, except as otherwise provided pursuant to section 3 of the act.

(b) The following warning statement will be considered as meeting the requirements of section 2(p)(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i)) if the only hazard associated with an article is that the contents are under pressure:

(c) That portion of the warning statement set forth in paragraph (b) of this section in capital letters should be printed on the main (front) panel of the container in capital letters of the type size specified in § 1500.121(c). The balance of the cautionary statements may appear together on another panel if the front panel also bears a statement such as "Read carefully other cautions on _____ panel."

(d) If an article has additional hazards, such as skin or eye irritancy, toxicity, or flammability, appropriate additional front and rear panel precautionary labeling is required.
