###### § 301.35 Substitution of labels.

(a) Persons authorized under the provisions of section 3(e) of the act to substitute labels affixed to fur products may do so, provided the substitute label is complete and carries all the information required under the act and rules and regulations in the same form and manner as required in respect to the original label. The substitute label need not, however, show the name or registered number appearing on the original label if the name or registered number of the person who affixes the substitute appears thereon.

(b) The original label may be used as a substitute label provided the name or registered number of the person making the substitution is inserted thereon without interfering with or obscuring in any manner other required information. In connection with such substitution the name or registered number as well as any record numbers appearing on the original label may be removed.

(c) Persons substituting labels under the provision of this section shall maintain the records required under § 301.41 of this part.
