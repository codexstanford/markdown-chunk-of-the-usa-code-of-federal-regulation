###### § 300.19 Use of terms "mohair" and "cashmere."

(a)(1) In setting forth the required fiber content of a wool product, the term "cashmere" may be used for such fiber content only if:

(i) Such fiber consists of the fine (dehaired) undercoat fibers produced by a cashmere goat (capra hircus laniger);

(ii) The average diameter of such cashmere fiber does not exceed 19 microns; and

(iii) The cashmere fibers in such wool product contain no more than 3 percent (by weight) of cashmere fibers with average diameters that exceed 30 microns.

(2) The average fiber diameter may be subject to a coefficient of variation around the mean that shall not exceed 24 percent.

(b) In setting forth the required fiber content of a product containing hair of the Angora goat known as mohair or containing cashmere (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section), the term "mohair" or "cashmere," respectively, may be used for such fiber in lieu of the word "wool," provided the respective percentage of each such fiber designated as "mohair" or "cashmere" is given, and provided further that such term "mohair" or "cashmere" where used is qualified by the word "recycled" when the fiber referred to is "recycled wool" as defined in the Act. The following are examples of fiber content designations permitted under this section:

(c) Where an election is made to use the term "mohair" or "cashmere" in lieu of the term "wool" as permitted by this section, the appropriate designation of "mohair" or "cashmere" shall be used at any time reference is made to such fiber in either required or nonrequired information. The term "mohair" or "cashmere" or any words, coined words, symbols or depictions connoting or implying the presence of such fibers shall not be used in non-required information on the required label or on any secondary or auxiliary label attached to the wool product if the term "mohair" or "cashmere," as the case may be, does not appear in the required fiber content disclosure.
