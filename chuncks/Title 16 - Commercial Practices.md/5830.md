#### PART 1510 - REQUIREMENTS FOR RATTLES
##### § 1510.1 Scope and purpose of part 1510.

This part 1510 sets forth the requirement whereby rattles (as defined in § 1510.2) are not banned articles under § 1500.18(a)(15) of this chapter. The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that certain infant rattles which may cause choking and/or suffocation because their design or construction permits them to enter into an infant's mouth and become lodged in the throat are eliminated from interstate commerce.
