##### Subpart B - Certification
###### § 1204.13 Certificate of compliance.

(a) The manufacturer or importer of any product subject to the standard must issue the certificate of compliance required by section 14(a) of the act. If the testing required by this subpart B of part 1204 has been performed by or for the foreign manufacturer of a product, the importer may rely on such tests to support the certificate of compliance if the importer is a resident of the United States or has a resident agent in the U.S., and the records are maintained in the U.S. The importer is responsible for ensuring that the foreign manufacturer's records show that all testing used to support the certificate of compliance has been performed properly with passing or acceptable results and that the records provide a reasonable assurance that all antennas imported comply with the standard.

(b) A certificate of compliance must accompany each product or otherwise be furnished to any distributor or retailer to whom the product is delivered by the manufacturer or importer.

(c) The certificate shall state:

(1) That the product "complies with all applicable consumer product safety standards (16 CFR part 1204)",

(2) The name and address of the manufacturer or importer issuing the certificate, and

(3) The date of manufacture and, if different from the address in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the place of manufacture.
