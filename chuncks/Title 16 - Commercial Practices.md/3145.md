Sources of information for assessment include CPSC staff studies and research reports, information gathered at hearings or meetings held to obtain the views of the public on the proposed action, and other information received from members of the public and from governmental entities.

(b) The assessment shall identify and describe any methods or approaches which would avoid or minimize adverse effects on the environment.
