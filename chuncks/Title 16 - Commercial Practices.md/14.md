##### § 0.17 Bureau of Consumer Protection.

The Bureau is responsible for enforcing the prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts or practices in section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45), as well as numerous special statutes that the Commission is charged with enforcing. The Bureau carries out its responsibilities by investigating alleged law violations, recommending to the Commission such further steps as may be appropriate, and prosecuting enforcement actions authorized by the Commission. Such further steps may include seeking injunctive and other relief as permitted by statute in Federal district court; litigating before the agency's administrative law judges; negotiating settlement of complaints; initiating rules or reports; and initiating civil penalty proceedings for rule violations. The Bureau also conducts compliance investigations and, in compliance with Section 16(a)(1) of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. 56(a)(1)), initiates proceedings for civil penalties to assure compliance with final Commission orders dealing with unfair or deceptive practices. The Bureau participates in trade regulation rulemaking proceedings under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)) and other rulemaking proceedings under statutory authority. In addition, the Bureau seeks to educate both consumers and the business community about the laws it enforces, and to assist and cooperate with other state, local, and international agencies and organizations in consumer protection enforcement and regulatory matters.
