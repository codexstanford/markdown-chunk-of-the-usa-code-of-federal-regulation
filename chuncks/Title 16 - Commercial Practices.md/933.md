###### § 300.12 Labeling of pairs or products containing two or more units.

(a) Where a wool product consists of two or more parts, units, or items of different fiber content, a separate label containing the required information shall be affixed to each of such parts, units, or items showing the required information as to such part, unit, or item, provided that where such parts, units, or items, are marketed or handled as a single product or ensemble and are sold and delivered to the ultimate consumer as a single product or ensemble, the required information may be set out on a single label in such a manner as to separately show the fiber composition of each part, unit, or item.

(b) Where garments, wearing apparel, or other wool products are marketed or handled in pairs or ensembles of the same fiber content, only one unit of the pair or ensemble need be labeled with the required information when sold and delivered to the ultimate consumer.

(c) Where parts or units of wool products of the types referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are sold separately, such parts or units shall be labeled with the information required by the Act and regulations.
