##### § 23.25 Misuse of the words "ruby," "sapphire," "emerald," "topaz," "stone," "birthstone," "gem," "gemstone," etc.

(a) It is unfair or deceptive to use the unqualified words "ruby," "sapphire," "emerald," "topaz," or the name of any other precious or semi-precious stone to describe any product that is not in fact a mined stone of the type described.

(b) It is unfair or deceptive to use the word "ruby," "sapphire," "emerald," "topaz," or the name of any other precious or semi-precious stone, or the word "stone," "birthstone," "gem," "gemstone," or similar term to describe a laboratory-grown, laboratory-created, [manufacturer name]-created, synthetic, imitation, or simulated stone, unless such word or name is immediately preceded with equal conspicuousness by the word "laboratory-grown," "laboratory-created," "[manufacturer name]-created," or some other word or phrase of like meaning, or by the word "imitation" or "simulated," so as to disclose clearly the nature of the product and the fact it is not a mined gemstone.

(c) It is unfair or deceptive to use the word "laboratory-grown," "laboratory-created," "[manufacturer name]-created," "synthetic," or other word or phrase of like meaning with the name of any natural stone to describe any industry product unless such product has essentially the same optical, physical, and chemical properties as the stone named.

(d) It is unfair or deceptive to describe products made with gemstone material and any amount of filler or binder, such as lead glass, in the following way:

(1) With the unqualified word "ruby," "sapphire," "emerald," "topaz," or name of any other precious or semi-precious stone;

(2) As a "treated ruby," "treated sapphire," "treated emerald," "treated topaz," or "treated [gemstone name]";

(3) As a "laboratory-grown [gemstone name]," "laboratory-created [gemstone name]," "[manufacturer name]-created [gemstone name]," "or "synthetic [gemstone name];" or

(4) As a "composite [gemstone name]," "hybrid [gemstone name]," or "manufactured [gemstone name]," unless the term is qualified to disclose clearly and conspicuously that the product: (A) Does not have the same characteristics as the named stone; and (B) requires special care. It is further recommended that the seller disclose the special care requirements to the purchaser.
