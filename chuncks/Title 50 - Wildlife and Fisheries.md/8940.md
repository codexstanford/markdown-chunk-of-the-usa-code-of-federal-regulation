(a) To change information in a grant application after you receive a grant, you must propose a revision of the grant and we must approve it.

(b) We may approve a revision if:

(i) Would not significantly decrease the benefits of the project; and

(i) Involves process, materials, logistics, or other items that have no significant effect on the factors used to decide the score; and

(ii) Keeps an equal or greater percentage of the non-Federal matching share of the total BIG project costs.

(c) We may approve a decrease in the Federal funds requested in the application subject to paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) The Regional WSFR Office must follow its own procedures for review and approval of any changes to a BIG Tier 1-State grant.

(e) The Regional WSFR Office must receive approval from the WSFR Headquarters Office for any changes to a BIG Tier 2-National grant that involves cost or affects project benefits.
