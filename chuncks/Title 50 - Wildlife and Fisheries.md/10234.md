##### Subpart N - Subpart N - Taking and Importing Marine Mammals Incidental to U.S. Navy Construction at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine
###### § 217.134 Mitigation requirements.
####### e.g.,

(2) Should environmental conditions deteriorate such that marine mammals within the entire shutdown zone would not be visible (fog, heavy rain, night), the Navy shall delay pile driving and drilling until observers are confident marine mammals within the shutdown zone could be detected.

(3) The Navy must ensure that construction supervisors and crews, the monitoring team, and relevant Navy staff are trained prior to the start of construction activity subject to this rule, so that responsibilities, communication procedures, monitoring protocols, and operational procedures are clearly understood. New personnel joining during the project will be trained prior to commencing work.

(4) The Navy, construction supervisors and crews, protected species observers (PSOs), and relevant Navy staff must avoid direct physical interaction with marine mammals during construction activity. If a marine mammal comes within 10 m of such activity, operations will cease and vessels will reduce speed to the minimum level required to maintain steerage and safe working conditions, as necessary, to avoid direct physical interaction.

(5) The Navy must monitor the project area to the maximum extent possible based on the required number of PSOs, required monitoring locations, and environmental conditions as described in this rule and the NMFS-approved Marine Mammal Monitoring Plan.
