###### § 36.16 Closure to subsistence uses of fish and wildlife.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Refuge Manager, after consultation with the State and adequate notice and public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate, may temporarily close all or any portion of an Alaska National Wildlife Refuge to subsistence uses of a particular fish or wildlife population only if necessary for reasons of public safety, administration, or to assure the continued viability of such population. For the purposes of this section, the term "temporarily" shall means only so long as reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of the closure.

(b) If the Refuge Manager determines that an emergency situation exists and that extraordinary measures must be taken for public safety or to assure the continued viability of a particular fish or wildlife population, he may immediately close all or any portion of a refuge to the subsistence uses of such population. Such emergency closure shall be effective when made, shall not exceed sixty (60) days, and may not subsequently be extended unless the Refuge Manager establishes, after notice and public hearing in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate, that such closure should be extended.

(c) Notice of administrative actions taken pursuant to this section and the reasons justifying such actions shall be published in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the State and in at least one local newspaper if available, and information about such actions and justifying reasons shall be made available for broadcast on local radio stations in a manner reasonably calculated to inform local rural residents in the affected vicinity. All closures shall be designated on a map which shall be available for public inspection at the office of the Refuge Manager of the affected refuge area and the post office or postal authority of every affected community within or near the refuge area, or by the posting of signs in the vicinity of the closures, or both.
