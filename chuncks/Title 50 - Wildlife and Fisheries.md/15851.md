#### § 520.6 Extensions of time.

(a) Whenever unusual circumstances exist, as set forth in § 520.6(b), the times within which determinations must be made by the General Counsel on requests for access (10 working days), and by the Director on requests for reconsideration (20 working days), may be extended by written notice to the requester. The notice shall set forth the reasons for such extension, and the date on which a determination is expected to be made. The maximum extension of time allowed under this section shall be 10 working days, but shall be utilized only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request.

(b) As used in this section, "unusual circumstances" shall mean:

(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the Commission offices;

(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are the subject of a single request; or

(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.
