####### Maps and critical habitat unit descriptions for the island of Molokai, HI.

(c)Critical habitat units are described below. Coordinates are in UTM Zone 4 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The following map shows the locations of the critical habitat units designated on the island of Molokai. Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, do not contain one or more of the physical and biological features. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species or physical or biological features in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) NOTE: Map 1-Index map follows:

(2) Molokai-Coastal-Unit 1 (125 ac, 50 ha) and Molokai-Coastal-Unit 2 (977 ac, 396 ha).
