(3) Supplementary information as required by paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) A request for transfer of marine mammal management authority will not be approved unless it contains the following:

(1) The scientific and common names and estimated range of the species of marine mammals subject to the state management program.

(2) Provisions of state law concerning the take of marine mammals that-

(i) Require that the taking of marine mammals be humane as defined by section 3(4) of the Act;

(ii) Do not permit the taking of marine mammals until the following have occurred:

(A) The state, pursuant to the requirements of § 403.04 of this part, has determined that the species is at its Optimum Sustainable Population (OSP) and determined the maximum number of animals that may be taken without reducing the species below its OSP, and, in the case of Alaska, when a species is below OSP, the maximum numbers that can be taken for subsistence uses while allowing the species to increase toward its OSP;

(B) The determination as to OSP and maximum take are final and implemented under state law; and

(C) A cooperative allocation agreement, if required under § 403.05(a) of this part, is implemented;

(iii) Do not permit take in excess of the maximum number of animals that may be taken as determined pursuant to § 403.04 of this part; provided that for Alaska, subsistence take may be allowed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, and if the species is below OSP, any level of take allowed for subsistence use shall permit the species to increase toward OSP;

(iv) Do not permit take that is for scientific research or public display purposes except such take by or on behalf of the state, or pursuant to a Federal permit issued under § 18.31 or § 216.31 of this title; and

(v) Regulate the incidental taking of the species in a manner consistent with section 101(a) (2), (4) and (5) of the Act.

(3) Provisions for annually acquiring and evaluating data and other new evidence relating to OSP of the species and the maximum allowable take, and if warranted on the basis of such evaluation, for requiring reevaluations of OSP and maximum allowable take determinations pursuant to § 403.04.

(4) Procedures for the resolution of differences between the state and the appropriate Service that might arise during the development of a cooperative allocation agreement pursuant to § 403.05(a) of this part.

(5) Procedures for the submission of an annual report meeting the requirements of § 403.06(b) of this part to the appropriate Service regarding the administration of the state management program during the reporting period.

(6) A description of-

(iii) State laws relating to judicial review of administrative decisions as they relate to the state management program;

(iv) State laws relating to administrative rulemaking as they relate to the state management program;

(c) In addition to the aspects of the state management program required to be submitted by paragraph (b) of this section, the state shall submit information, in summary form, relating to:

(1) The anticipated staffing and funding of state offices involved in the administration and enforcement of the state management program;

(2) Anticipated research and enforcement activities relating to conservation of the species for which management authority is sought; and

(3) Such other materials and information as the Service may request or which the state may deem necessary or advisable to demonstrate the compatibility of the state management program with the policy and purposes of the Act and the rules and regulations issued under the Act.

(d) In addition to the requirements contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a request for the transfer of marine mammal management authority by the State of Alaska must contain the following concerning subsistence use of the species-

(1) A statute and regulations concerning the take of marine mammals that ensure that

(i) The taking of marine mammals species for subsistence uses will be the priority consumptive uses of the species;

(ii) If restrictions on subsistence uses of the species are required, such restrictions shall be based upon the customary and direct dependence upon the species as the mainstay of livelihood, local residency, and the availability of alternative resources; and

(iii) The taking of marine mammal species for subsistence uses is accomplished in a non-wasteful manner;

(2) Statutes or regulations that ensure that the appropriate state agency will-

(i) Authorize nonsubsistence consumptive uses of a marine mammal species only if such uses will have no significant adverse impact on subsistence uses of the species;

(ii) Regulate nonsubsistence consumptive uses in a manner which, to the maximum extent practicable, provides economic opportunities, including, but not limited to, licensing of marine mammal hunting guides and the assignment of guiding areas, for residents of rural coastal villages of Alaska who engage in subsistence uses of the species; and

(3) A narrative discussion of the statutes or regulations required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and any additional policies or procedures concerning the regulation of nonsubsistence consumptive uses of marine mammals. This discussion must explain how the State's program satisfies the requirements of section 109(f) of the Act, namely that the regulation of nonsubsistence consumptive uses of marine mammals provides, to the maximum extent praticable, economic opportunities for the residents of rural coastal villages of Alaska who engage in subsistence uses of the species.
