(1) A description of the exotic bird(s) to be imported, including:

(i) The common and scientific names of the species, number, age or age class, and, when known, sex; and

(ii) A statement as to whether, at the time of the application, the exotic bird is still in the wild, has already been removed from the wild, or was bred in captivity;

(2) If the exotic bird is in the wild or was taken from the wild include:

(i) The country and region where the removal will occur or occurred;

(ii) A description of the status of the species in the region of removal; and

(iii) A copy of any foreign collecting permit or authorizing letter, if applicable;

(3) If the exotic bird was bred in captivity, include:

(i) Documents or other evidence that the bird was bred in captivity, including the name and address of the breeder, and when known, identity of the parental birds, and hatch date; and

(ii) If the applicant is not the breeder, documentation showing the bird was acquired from a breeder and a history of multiple transactions, if applicable;

(4) A statement of the reasons the applicant is justified in obtaining a permit, and a complete description of the breeding or display program to be conducted with the exotic bird requested, including:

(i) A breeding or education protocol that provides information on educational materials on the ecology and/or conservation status of the species provided to the general public;

(ii) Plans, if any, for developing or maintaining a self-sustaining population of the exotic bird species in captivity;

(iii) A statement on efforts to obtain birds from alternative sources or sources within the United States;

(iv) The relationship of such a breeding or display program to the conservation of the species in the wild; and

(v) Plans for disposition of the exotic birds and any progeny.

(5) A description of the care and maintenance of the exotic bird, and how the facility meets professionally recognized standards of the public display community, including:

(i) The name and address of the facility where the exotic bird will be maintained;

(ii) Dimensions of existing enclosures for the birds to be imported and number of birds to be housed in each;

(iii) Husbandry practices;

(6) A history of the zoological facility's breeding programs with the same or similar species, including:

(i) Participation in any cooperative breeding programs;

(ii) Breeding and inventory records for the last two years, including hatching, survival, and mortality records; and

(iii) Causes of any mortalities and efforts made to correct any problems.

(b) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide whether or not a permit should be issued. In making this decision, the Director shall consider, in addition to the general criteria in part 13 of this subchapter, the following factors:

(1) Whether the zoological breeding or display program is adequate to justify removing the exotic bird from the wild or otherwise changing its status;

(2) Whether the proposed import would be detrimental to the survival of the exotic bird species in the wild, including whether the exotic bird was bred in captivity or was (or will be) taken from the wild, taking into consideration the conservation status of the species in the wild;

(3) Whether the permit, if issued, would conflict with any known program intended to enhance the survival of the population from which the exotic bird was or would be removed;

(4) Whether the breeding or display program for which the permit is required has conservation merit; and

(5) Whether the expertise, facilities or other resources available to the applicant appear adequate for proper care and maintenance of the exotic bird and to successfully accomplish the zoological breeding or display objectives stated in the application.

(c) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this section shall be subject to special conditions as the Director may deem appropriate.

(d) Duration of permits. The duration of the import permits issued under this section shall be designated on the face of the permit, but in no case will these permits be valid for longer than one year.
