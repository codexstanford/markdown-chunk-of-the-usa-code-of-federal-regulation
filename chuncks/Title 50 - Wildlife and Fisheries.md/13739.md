##### § 230.7 Salvage of stinkers.

(a) Any person salvaging a stinker shall submit to the Assistant Administrator or his/her representative an oral or written report describing the circumstances of the salvage within 12 hours of such salvage. He/she shall provide promptly to the Assistant Administrator or his/her representative each harpoon, lance, or explosive dart found in or attached to the stinker.
