###### § 36.1 How do the regulations in this part apply to me and what do they cover?

(a) The regulations contained in this part are prescribed for the proper use and management of all Alaska National Wildlife Refuges and supplement the general National Wildlife Refuge System regulations found in title 50 CFR chapter I, subchapter C. The general National Wildlife Refuge System regulations are automatically applicable in their entirety to the Alaska National Wildlife Refuges except as supplemented or modified by these regulations or amended by ANILCA.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the regulations contained in this part are applicable only on federally-owned lands within the boundaries of any Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. For purposes of this part, "federally-owned lands" means land interests held or retained by the United States, but does not include those land interests:

(1) Tentatively approved, legislatively conveyed, or patented to the State of Alaska; or

(2) Interim conveyed or patented to a Native Corporation or person.

(c) The regulations found in 50 CFR, parts 25, 26, 27, and 28, and §§ 32.2(d) and 32.5(c), except as supplemented or modified by this part or amended by ANILCA, along with the regulations found in 50 CFR 36.35(d), also are applicable to administrative and visitor facility sites of the Fish and Wildlife Service in Alaska which we may hold in fee or less than fee title and are either inside or outside the approved boundaries of any Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. Less than fee title lands do not include easements under Section 17(b) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688), but although not limited to, they include sites administered by a national wildlife refuge under the terms of a memorandum of understanding or lease agreement.
