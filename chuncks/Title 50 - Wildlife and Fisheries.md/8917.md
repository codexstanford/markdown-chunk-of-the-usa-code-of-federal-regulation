###### § 86.58 What does the Service consider when evaluating a project for a physical component, technology, or technique that will improve eligible user access?

(a) In evaluating a proposed project under the criterion at § 85.51(c)(1), we consider whether the project will increase the availability of the BIG-funded facility for eligible users or improve eligible boater access to the facility by:

(1) Using a new technology or technique; or

(2) Applying a new use of an existing technology or technique.

(b) We will not award points for following access standards set by law.

(c) We will consider if you choose to complete the project using an optional or advanced technology or technique that will improve access, or if you go beyond the minimum requirements.

(d) To receive consideration for this criterion, you must describe in the grant application the current standard and how you will exceed the standard.
