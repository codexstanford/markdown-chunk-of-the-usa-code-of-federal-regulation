####### § 14.133 Care in transit.

(a) Any marine mammal shall be accompanied, in the same conveyance, by the shipper or an authorized representative of the shipper knowledgeable in marine mammal care to provide for the animal's health and well-being. The shipper or representative shall observe such marine mammals to determine whether or not they need veterinary care and shall provide or obtain any needed veterinary care as soon as possible. Care during transport shall include the following (on a species-specific basis):

(1) Keeping the skin moist or preventing the drying of the skin by such methods as covering with wet cloths, spraying it with water or applying a nontoxic emollient;

(2) Assuring that the pectoral flippers (when applicable) are allowed freedom of movement at all times;

(3) Making adjustments in the position of the mammal when necessary to prevent necrosis of the skin at weight pressure points; and

(4) Calming the mammal to prevent struggling, thrashing, and other activity that may cause overheating or physical trauma.

(b) Unless otherwise directed by a shipper or authorized representative, at least one-half of the floor area in a primary enclosure used to transport sea otters to the United States shall contain sufficient crushed ice or ice water to provide each otter with moisture necessary to maintain its hair coat by preventing it from drying and to minimize soiling of the hair coat with urine and fecal material.

(c) A marine mammal exhibiting excited or otherwise dangerous behavior shall not be taken from its primary enclosure except under extreme emergency conditions and then only by the shipper or other authorized individual who is capable of handling the animal safely.
