(1) The reduction fishery;

(2) The reduction methodology;

(3) The maximum reduction cost;

(4) The maximum reduction loan amount, if different from the maximum reduction cost;

(5) The reduction cost funding, if any, other than a reduction loan;

(11) The referendum procedures; and

(12) Any relevant post-referendum reduction procedures other than those in the implementation regulations or this subpart.

(c) NMFS will base each implementation plan and implementation regulations for a subsidized program on the final development plan. The implementation plan will describe in detail all relevant aspects of implementing the program, including:

(1) The reduction fishery;

(2) The reduction methodology;

(3) The maximum reduction cost;

(4) The reduction-cost funding, if any, other than Federal appropriations;

(5) The criteria for determining the types and number of fishing permits or fishing permits and fishing vessels eligible to participate in the program;

(6) The invitation to bid and bidding procedures;

(7) The criteria for determining bid acceptance; and

(8) Any relevant post-bidding program procedures other than those in the implementation regulations or this subpart.

(d) The implementation regulations will:

(1) Specify, for invitations to bid, bids, and reduction contracts under § 600.1009:

(i) Bidder eligibility,

(ii) Bid submission requirements and procedures,

(iii) A bid opening date, before which a bidder may not bid, and a bid closing date, after which a bidder may not bid,

(v) The manner of bid submission and the information each bidder shall supply for NMFS to deem a bid responsive,

(vi) The conditions under which NMFS will accept or reject a bid,

(vii) The manner in which NMFS will accept or reject a bid, and

(2) Specify any other special referendum procedures or criteria; and

(3) Specify such other provisions, in addition to and consistent with those in this subpart, necessary to regulate the individual terms and conditions of each program and reduction loan. This includes, but is not limited to:

(ii) Prospective fee rate determinations, and

(iii) Any other aspect of fee payment, collection, deposit, disbursement, accounting, record keeping, and/or reporting.

(e) NMFS will issue final implementation regulations and adopt a final implementation plan within 45 days of the close of the public-comment period.

(f) NMFS may repeal the final implementation regulations for any program if:

(1) For a financed program, the bidding results do not conform to the fishing capacity reduction specifications or a post-bidding referendum does not subsequently approve an industry fee system based on the bidding results;

(2) For a subsidized program, NMFS does not accept bids; and

(3) For either a financed program or a subsidized program, if NMFS is unable to make all reduction payments due to a material adverse change.
