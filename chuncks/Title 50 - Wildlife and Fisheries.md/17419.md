##### § 622.11 Bag and possession limits - general applicability.
###### Applicability.

(a)(1) The bag and possession limits apply for a species or species group in or from the EEZ. Unless specified otherwise, bag limits apply to a person on a daily basis, regardless of the number of trips in a day. Unless specified otherwise, a person is limited to a single bag limit for a trip lasting longer than one calendar day. Unless specified otherwise, possession limits apply to a person on a trip after the first 24 hours of that trip. The bag and possession limits apply to a person who fishes in the EEZ in any manner, except a person on a vessel in the EEZ that has on board the commercial vessel permit required under this part for the appropriate species or species group. The possession of a commercial vessel permit notwithstanding, the bag and possession limits apply when the vessel is operating as a charter vessel or headboat. A person who fishes in the EEZ may not combine a bag limit specified in subparts B through U of this part with a bag or possession limit applicable to state waters. A species or species group subject to a bag limit specified in subparts B through U of this part and taken in the EEZ by a person subject to the bag limits may not be transferred at sea, regardless of where such transfer takes place, and such fish may not be transferred in the EEZ. The operator of a vessel that fishes in the EEZ is responsible for ensuring that the bag and possession limits specified in subparts B through U of this part are not exceeded.
