###### § 86.52 What does the Service consider when evaluating a project on the need for more or improved boating infrastructure?

In evaluating a proposed project under the criterion at §§ 86.51(a)(1) on the need for more or improved boating infrastructure facilities, we consider whether the project will:

(a) Construct new boating infrastructure in an area that lacks it, but where eligible vessels now travel or would travel if the project were completed;

(b) Renovate a facility to:

(1) Improve its physical condition;

(2) Follow local building codes;

(3) Improve generally accepted safety standards; or

(4) Adapt it to a new purpose for which there is a demonstrated need;

(c) Create accessibility for eligible vessels by reducing wave action, increasing depth, or making other physical improvements;

(d) Expand an existing marina or mooring site that is unable to accommodate current or projected demand by eligible vessels; or

(e) Make other improvements to accommodate an established eligible need.
