(a) The State fish and wildlife agency must treat income earned by a subgrantee after the grant period as:

(1) License revenue for the administration of the agency;

(2) Additional funding for purposes consistent with the grant or the program; or

(3) Income subject only to the terms of the subgrant agreement and any subsequent contractual agreements between the agency and the subgrantee.

(b) The agency must indicate its choice of one of the above alternatives in the project statement that it submits with each application for Federal assistance. If the agency does not indicate its choice in the project statement, the subgrantee does not have to account for any income that it earns after the grant period unless required to do so in the subgrant agreement or in any subsequent contractual agreement.
