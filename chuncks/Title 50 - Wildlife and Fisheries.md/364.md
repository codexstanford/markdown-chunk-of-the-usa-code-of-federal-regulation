###### § 15.22 Permits for scientific research.

(a) Application requirements for permits for scientific research. Each application shall provide the following information and such other information that the Director may require:

(1) A description of the exotic bird(s) to be imported, including:

(i) The common and scientific names of the species, number, age or age class, and, when known, sex; and

(ii) A statement as to whether, at the time of the application, the exotic bird is still in the wild, has already been removed from the wild, or was bred in captivity;

(2) If the exotic bird is in the wild or was taken from the wild, include:

(i) The country and region where the removal will occur or occurred;

(ii) A description of the status of the species in the region of removal; and

(iii) A copy of any foreign collecting permit or authorizing letter, if applicable;

(3) If the exotic bird was bred in captivity, include:

(i) Documents or other evidence that the bird was bred in captivity, including the name and address of the breeder, and when known, hatch date and identity of the parental birds; and

(ii) If the applicant is not the breeder, documentation showing the bird was acquired from a breeder and a history of multiple transactions, if applicable:

(4) A statement of the reasons the applicant is justified in obtaining a permit, and a complete description of the scientific research to be conducted on the exotic bird requested, including:

(i) Formal research protocol with timetable;

(ii) The relationship of such research to the conservation of the species in the wild;

(iii) A discussion of possible alternatives and efforts to obtain birds from other sources; and

(iv) Plans for disposition of the exotic birds and any progeny upon completion of the research project;

(5) Qualifications of the scientific personnel conducting the proposed research, including applicable experience and a description of relevant past research conducted;

(6) A description of the care and maintenance of the exotic bird, and how the facility meets professionally recognized standards, including;

(i) The name and address of the facility where the exotic bird will be maintained;

(ii) Dimensions of existing enclosures for the birds to be imported and number of birds to be housed in each; and

(iii) Husbandry practices.

(b) Issuance criteria. Upon receiving an application completed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the Director will decide whether or not a permit should be issued. In making this decision, the Director shall consider, in addition to the general criteria in part 13 of this subchapter, the following factors;

(1) Whether the purpose of the scientific research is adequate to justify removing the exotic bird from the wild or otherwise changing its status;

(2) Whether the proposed import would be detrimental to the survival of the exotic bird species in the wild, including whether the exotic bird was bred in captivity or was (or will be) taken from the wild, taking into consideration the conservation status of the species in the wild;

(3) Whether the permit, if issued, would conflict with any known program intended to enhance the survival of the population from which the exotic bird was or would be removed;

(4) Whether the research for which the permit is required has scientific merit;

(5) Whether the expertise, facilities, or other resources available to the applicant appear adequate for proper care and maintenance of the exotic bird and to successfully accomplish the research objectives stated in the application.

(c) Permit conditions. In addition to the general conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter, every permit issued under this section shall be subject to special conditions as the Director may deem appropriate.

(d) Duration of permits. The duration of the import permits issued under this section shall be designated on the face of the permit, but in no case will these permits be valid for longer than one year.
