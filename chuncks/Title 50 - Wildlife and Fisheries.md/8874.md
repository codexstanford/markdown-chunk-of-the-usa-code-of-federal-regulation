###### § 86.14 How can I receive BIG funds for facility maintenance?

(a) For BIG Tier 1-State and BIG Tier 2-National grants:

(1) You may request BIG funds for facility maintenance only if you will complete the maintenance action during the period of performance.

(2) You may apply user fees collected at the BIG-funded facility after the period of performance to the maintenance of the facility.

(b) For BIG Tier 1-State grants:

(1) You may request BIG funds for one-time or as-needed maintenance costs at any BIG-eligible facility as long as the costs are discrete and follow paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) If you use BIG funds for maintenance at a facility that has received a BIG grant in the past, you must extend the useful life of each affected capital improvement accordingly.

(3) States may limit or exclude BIG maintenance funding they make available to subgrantees.

(c) For BIG Tier 2-National grants, you may request BIG funds for maintenance if it directly benefits eligible users and is directly related to the BIG project. You are responsible for all maintenance costs after the period of performance except as provided at paragraph (b) of this section.
