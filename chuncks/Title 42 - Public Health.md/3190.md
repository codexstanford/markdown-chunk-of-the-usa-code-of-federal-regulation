Sponsorship must be by an entity that assumes primary responsibility for the planning and conduct of competency-based didactic and clinical training in dental radiography.

1. This responsibility must include: defining the curriculum in terms of program goals, instructional objectives, learning experiences designed to achieve goals and objectives, and evaluation procedures to assess attainment of goals and objectives; coordinating classroom teaching and supervised clinical experiences; appointing faculty; receiving and processing applications for admission; and granting documents of successful completion of the program.

2. The formal training in dental radiography may be a part of a total program of dental hygiene education accredited by an organization recognized by the United States Department of Education.

3. The sponsoring entity and the dental radiography training must be approved by the State entity responsible for approving dental hygiene education programs or the State entity responsible for credentialing dental personnel in radiography.

Dental radiography training for dental hygienists must provide sufficient content and instructional time to assure competent performance.

1. The dental radiography curriculum content and learning experiences must include the theoretical aspects of the subject as well as practical application of techniques. The theoretical aspects should provide content necessary for dental hygienists to understand the critical nature of the radiological procedures they perform and of the judgments they make as related to patient and operator radiation safety.

2. The dental radiography curriculum must include content in seven areas: radiation physics; radiation biology; radiation health, safety, and protection; X-ray films and radiographic film quality; radiographic techniques; darkroom and processing techniques; and film mounting.

3. The curriculum must also include clinical practice assignments.

Evaluation procedures must be developed to assess performance and achievement of dental radiography program objectives.

The dental radiography training must be conducted by faculty who are qualified in the curriculum subject matter.

1. This may include a D.D.S./D.M.D. degree; graduation from an accredited dental assisting or dental hygiene education program with a certificate or an associate or baccalaureate degree; status as a Certified Dental Assistant certified by the Dental Assisting National Board; or recognition as equivalently qualified by the State entity which approved the training program in dental radiography.

2. The faculty-to-student ratio must be adequate to achieve the stated objectives of the curriculum.

Adequate radiographic facilities must be available to permit achievement of the dental radiography training objectives. The design, location, and construction of radiographic facilities must provide optimum protection from X-radiation for patients and operators. Equipment shall meet State and Federal laws related to radiation. Monitoring devices shall be worn by dental personnel. Lead aprons must be placed to protect patients. Safe storage for films must be provided. Darkroom facilities and equipment must be available and of a quality that assures that films will not be damaged or lost.

A wide range of printed materials, instructional aids, and equipment must be available to support instruction. Current specialized reference texts should be provided; and models, replicas, slides, and films which depict current techniques should be available for use in instruction. As appropriate self-instructional materials become available, they should be provided for the student's use.
