###### § 430.60 Scope.

(a) This subpart sets forth the rules for hearings to States that appeal a decision to disapprove State plan material (under § 430.18) or to withhold Federal funds (under § 430.35), because the State plan or State practice in the Medicaid program is not in compliance with Federal requirements.

(b) Nothing in this subpart is intended to preclude or limit negotiations between CMS and the State, whether before, during, or after the hearing to resolve the issues that are, or otherwise would be, considered at the hearing. Such negotiations and resolution of issues are not part of the hearing, and are not governed by the rules in this subpart except as expressly provided.
