###### § 403.200 Basis and scope.
####### Provisions of the legislation.

(a)This subpart implements, in part, section 1882 of the Social Security Act. The intent of that section is to enable Medicare beneficiaries to identify Medicare supplemental policies that do not duplicate Medicare, and that provide adequate, fairly priced protection against expenses not covered by Medicare. The legislation establishes certain standards for Medicare supplemental policies and provides two methods for informing Medicare beneficiaries which policies meet those standards:

(1) Through a State approved program, that is, a program that a Supplemental Health Insurance Panel determines to meet certain minimum requirements for the regulation of Medicare supplemental policies; and

(2) In a State without an approved program, through certification by the Secretary of policies voluntarily submitted by insuring organizations for review against the standards.
