###### § 417.103 Providers of basic and supplemental health services.

(a)(1) The HMO must provide that the services of health professionals that are provided as basic health services will, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, be provided or arranged for through (i) health professionals who are staff of the HMO, (ii) a medical group or groups, (iii) an IPA or IPAs, (iv) physicians or other health professionals under direct service contracts with the HMO for the provision of these services, or (v) any combination of staff, medical group or groups, IPA or IPAs, or physicians or other health professionals under direct service contracts with the HMO.

(2) A staff or medical group model HMO may have as providers of basic health services physicians who have also entered into written services arrangements with an IPA or IPAs, but only if either (i) these physicians number less than 50 percent of the physicians who have entered into arrangements with the IPA or IPAs, or (ii) if the sharing is 50 percent or greater, CMS approves the sharing as being consistent with the purposes of section 1310(b) of the PHS Act.

(3) After the 4 year period beginning with the month following the month in that an HMO becomes a qualified HMO, an entity that meets the requirements of the definition of medical group in § 417.100, except for subdivision (3)(i) of that definition, may be considered a medical group if CMS determines that the principal professional activity (over 50 percent individually) of the entity's members is the coordinated practice of their profession, and if the HMO has demonstrated to the satisfaction of CMS that the entity is committed to the delivery of medical services on a prepaid group practice basis by either:

(i) Presenting a reasonable time-phased plan for the entity to achieve compliance with the "substantial responsibility" requirement of subdivision (3)(i) of the definition of "medical group" in § 417.100. The HMO must update the plan annually and must demonstrate to the satisfaction of CMS that the entity is making continuous efforts and progress towards compliance with the requirements of the definition of "medical group," or

(ii) Demonstrating that compliance by the entity with the "substantial responsibility" requirement is unreasonable or impractical because (A) the HMO serves a non-metropolitan or rural area as defined in § 417.100, or (B) the entity is a multi-speciality group that provides medical consultation upon referral on a regional or national basis, or (C) the majority of the residents of the HMO's service area are not eligible for employer-employee health benefits plans and the HMO has an insufficient number of enrollees to require utilization of at least 35 percent of the entity's services.

(b) HMOs must have effective procedures to monitor utilization and to control cost of basic and supplemental health services and to achieve utilization goals, which may include mechanisms such as risk sharing, financial incentives, or other provisions agreed to by providers.

(c) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to the provision of the services of a physician:

(1) Which the HMO determines are unusual or infrequently used services; or

(2) Which, because of an emergency, it was medically necessary to provide to the enrollee other than as required by paragraph (a) of this section; or

(3) Which are provided as part of the inpatient hospital services by employees or staff of a hospital or provided by staff of other entities such as community mental health centers, home health agencies, visiting nurses' associations, independent laboratories, or family planning agencies.

(d) Supplemental health services must be provided or arranged for by the HMO and need not be provided by providers of basic health services under contract with the HMO.

(e) Each HMO must:

(1) Pay the provider, or reimburse its enrollees for the payment of reasonable charges for basic health services (or supplemental health services that the HMO agreed to provide on a prepayment basis) for which its enrollees have contracted, which were medically necessary and immediately required to be obtained other than through the HMO because of an unforeseen illness, injury, or condition, as determined by the HMO;

(2) Adopt procedures to review promptly all claims from enrollees for reimbursement for the provision of health services described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, including a procedure for the determination of the medical necessity for obtaining the services other than through the HMO; and

(3) Provide instructions to its enrollees on procedures to be followed to secure these health services.
