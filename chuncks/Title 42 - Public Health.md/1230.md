###### § 35.8 Safekeeping of money and effects; withdrawals.

(a) A place for the safekeeping of money and effects of patients shall be provided at each station or hospital, and an itemized receipt therefor shall be furnished to the patient and to any other person who places money or effects therein for the benefit of the patient.

(b) Money and effects may be withdrawn only by or on behalf of the patient, by his legally appointed representative authorized to receive or dispose of his property (including the money and effects in the custody of the station or hospital), or by a person who is authorized, under the law of the State in which the station or hospital is located, to receive or dispose of the patient's money and effects. In any case in which the officer in charge has had actual notice of the appointment of a legal representative, withdrawals may be made only by such representative or in accordance with his written directions. No delivery shall be made under this paragraph unless (1) the person receiving the money or effects shall sign an itemized receipt therefor, or (2) the delivery is witnessed by two persons. The provisions of this paragraph do not prohibit withdrawals made necessary by the provisions of this part for the disposition of money and effects left by patients on death or on departure from the station or hospital, or by the provisions of § 35.10.
