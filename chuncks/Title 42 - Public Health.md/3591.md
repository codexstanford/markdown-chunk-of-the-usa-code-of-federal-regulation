###### § 84.252 Gas masks; requirements and tests.

(a) Except for the tests prescribed in § 84.126, the minimum requirements and performance tests for gas masks, prescribed in Subpart I of this part, are applicable to vinyl chloride gas masks.

(b) The following bench tests are applicable to canisters designed for use with gas masks for entry into and escape from vinyl chloride atmospheres containing adequate oxygen to support life:

(1) Four canisters will be equilibrated at 25 +/-5 &#xB0;C by passing 85 +/-5 percent relative humidity air through them at 64 liters per minute for six hours.

(2) The equilibrated canisters will be resealed, kept in an upright position at room temperature, and tested according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section within 18 hours.

(3) The canisters equilibrated and stored as described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section will be tested on an apparatus that allows the test atmosphere at 85 +/-5 percent relative humidity and 25 +/-5 &#xB0;C to enter the canister continuously at a concentration of 25 ppm vinyl chloride monomer at a total flow rate of 64 liters per minute.

(4) The maximum allowable penetration after six hours of testing according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall not exceed 1 ppm vinyl chloride.

(c) Where canisters are submitted for testing and approval with a service life of more than four hours, the period of time for testing for vinyl chloride penetration will be performed at 150% of the service life specified in the manufacturer's application. (Example: If a manufacturer requests approval of a respirator for six hours use against exposure to vinyl chloride, the maximum allowable penetration after nine hours of testing shall not exceed 1 ppm vinyl chloride.)
