For fixed price agreements, budgets may be stated as lump sums, unit cost pricing, or a combination thereof.

Categorical exclusion means a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and that have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a Federal agency in implementation of these regulations and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.

CEQ means Council on Environmental Quality in the Office of the President.

Construction management services (CMS) means activities limited to administrative support services; coordination; and monitoring oversight of the planning, design, and construction process. CMS activities typically include:
