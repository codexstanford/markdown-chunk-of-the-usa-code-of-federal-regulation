####### § 137.341 How will a Self-Governance Tribe receive payment under a construction project agreement?

(a) For all construction project agreements, advance payments shall be made annually or semiannually, at the Self-Governance Tribe's option. The initial payment shall include all contingency funding for the project or phase of the project to the extent that there are funds appropriated for that purpose.

(b) The amount of subsequent payments is based on the mutually agreeable project schedule reflecting:

(1) Work to be accomplished within the advance payment period,

(2) Work already accomplished, and

(3) Total prior payments for each annual or semiannual advance payment period.

(c) For lump sum, fixed price agreements, at the request of the Self-Governance Tribe, payments shall be based on an advance payment period measured as follows:

If project phase is chosen as the payment period, the full amount of funds necessary to perform the work for that phase of the construction project agreement is payable in the initial advance payment.
