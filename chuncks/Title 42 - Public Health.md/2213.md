###### § 57.409 Good cause for other use of completed facility.

If, within 20 years after completion of construction (or, in the case of interim facilities prior to the time at which teaching in such facilities is moved to a permanent facility, whichever comes first), the facility shall cease to be used for any one or more of the purposes for which it was constructed, the Secretary, in determining whether there is good cause for releasing the applicant or other owner of the facility from the obligation so to use the facility, shall take into consideration the extent to which:

(a) The facility will be devoted by the applicant or other owner to the teaching of other health personnel;

(b) There are reasonable assurances that for the remainder of such period other facilities not previously utilized for nurse training will be so utilized and are substantially the equivalent in nature and extent for such purposes.
