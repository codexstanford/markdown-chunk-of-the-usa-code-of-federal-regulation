###### § 475.103 Requirements for performing quality improvement initiatives.

(a) In determining whether or not an organization has demonstrated the ability to perform quality improvement initiatives, CMS will take into consideration factors such as:

(1) The organization's proposed processes, capabilities, quantitative, and/or qualitative performance objectives, and methodology to perform quality improvement initiatives;

(2) The organization's proposed involvement of and access to physicians and practitioners in the QIO area with the appropriate expertise and specialization in the areas of health care concerning the quality improvement initiatives;

(3) The organization's access to professionals with appropriate knowledge of quality improvement methodologies and practices; and

(4) The organization's access to qualified information technology (IT) expertise.

(b) In making determinations under this section, CMS may consider characteristics such as the organization's geographic location and size. CMS may also consider prior experience in health care quality improvement that CMS considers relevant to performing quality improvement initiatives; such prior experience may include prior similar quality improvement initiative experience and whether it achieved successful results.

(c) A State government that administers a Medicaid program will be considered incapable of performing quality improvement initiative functions in an effective manner, unless the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of CMS that the State agency performing the quality improvement initiatives will act with complete objectivity and independence from the Medicaid program.
