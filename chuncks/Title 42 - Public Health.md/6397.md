###### § 405.1829 Scope of authority of contractor hearing officer(s).

(a) The hearing officer(s) in exercising his authority must comply with all the provisions of title XVIII of the Act and regulations issued thereunder, as well as with CMS Rulings issued under the authority of the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (as described in § 401.108 of this chapter), and with the general instructions issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in accordance with the Secretary's agreement with the contractor.

(b)(1) If the contractor hearing officer(s) has jurisdiction to conduct a hearing on the specific matters at issue under § 405.1811, and the legal authority to fully resolve the matters in a hearing decision (as described in § 405.1831 of this subpart), the hearing officer(s) must affirm, modify, or reverse the contractor's findings on each specific matter at issue in the contractor or Secretary determination for the cost year under appeal.

(2) The contractor hearing officer(s) also may make additional revisions on specific matters regardless of whether the contractor considered the matters in issuing the contractor determination for the cost year, provided the hearing officer(s) does not consider or decide any specific matter for which it lacks jurisdiction (as described in § 405.1814(b) of this subpart) or which was not timely raised in the provider's hearing request.

(3) The authority of the contractor hearing officer(s) under this paragraph to make the additional revisions is limited to those revisions necessary to fully resolve a specific matter at issue if-

(i) The hearing officer(s) has jurisdiction to grant a hearing on the specific matter under §§ 405.1811 and 405.1814 of this subpart; and

(ii) The specific matter was timely raised in an initial request for a contractor hearing filed in accordance with § 405.1811(b) of this subpart or in a timely request to add issues to an appeal submitted in accordance with § 405.1811(c) of this subpart.
