###### § 62.10 What will happen if an individual does not comply with the terms and conditions of participating in the scholarship program?

(a) If a participant, other than one described in paragraph (b) of this section, fails to accept payment or instructs the school not to accept payment of the scholarship provided by the Secretary, the participant must, in addition to any service or other obligation incurred under the contract, pay to the United States the amount of $1,500 liquidated damages. Payment of this amount must be made within 30 days of the date on which the participant fails to accept payment of the scholarship award or instructs the school not to accept payment.

(b) When a participant fails to maintain an acceptable level of academic standing, is dismissed from the school for disciplinary reasons, or voluntarily terminates the course of study or program for which the scholarship was awarded before completing the course of study or program, the participant must, instead of performing any service obligation, pay to the United States an amount equal to all scholarship funds awarded under § 62.7. Payment of this amount must be made within 3 years of the date the participant becomes liable to make payment under this paragraph.

(c) If a participant fails to begin or complete the period of obligated service incurred under § 62.8, including failing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of a deferment granted by the Secretary, the participant must pay to the United States an amount determined by the formula set forth in section 754(c) of the Act. Payment of this amount shall be made within 1 year of the date that the participant failed to begin or complete the period of obligated service, as determined by the Secretary.
