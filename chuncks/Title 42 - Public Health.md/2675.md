###### § 66.111 Suspension, waiver, and cancellation.

(a) The Secretary may extend the period for undertaking service described in § 66.110(c), permit breaks in the continuous service required under § 66.110(c), or extend the period of repayment under § 66.110(e) if the Secretary determines that:

(1) An extension or break in service is necessary so the individual may complete his or her research training;

(2) Completion during the period would be impossible because the individual is temporarily disabled; or

(3) Completion during the period would involve a substantial hardship to the individual and failure to extend to the period would be against equity and good conscience.
