##### Subpart E - Guidelines To Estimate Probability of Causation
###### § 81.24 Guidelines for leukemia.

(a) For claims involving leukemia, DOL will calculate one or more probability of causation estimates from up to three of the four alternate leukemia risk models included in NIOSH-IREP, as specified in the NIOSH-IREP Operating Guide. These include: "Leukemia, all types" (ICD-10-CM codes C91-C95), "acute lymphocytic leukemia" (ICD-10-CM code C91.0), and "acute myelogenous leukemia" (ICD-10-CM codes C92.6 and C92.A).

(b) For leukemia claims in which DOL calculates multiple probability of causation estimates, as specified in the NIOSH-IREP Operating Guide, the probability of causation estimate DOL assigns to the claim will be based on the leukemia risk model producing the highest estimate for probability of causation.
