####### § 137.115 Is a Self-Governance Tribe obligated to continue performance under a compact or funding agreement if the Secretary does not transfer sufficient funds?

No, if a Self-Governance Tribe believes that the total amount of funds provided for a specific PSFA in a compact or funding agreement is insufficient, the Self-Governance Tribe must provide reasonable written notice of such insufficiency to the Secretary. If the Secretary does not increase the amount of funds transferred under the funding agreement in a quantity sufficient for the Self-Governance Tribe to complete the PSFA, as jointly determined by the Self-Governance Tribe and the Secretary, the Self-Governance Tribe may suspend performance of the PSFA until such time as additional funds are transferred.
