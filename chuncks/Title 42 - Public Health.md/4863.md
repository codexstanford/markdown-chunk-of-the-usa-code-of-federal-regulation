####### § 137.333 What procedures must the Secretary follow if the Secretary rejects a final construction project proposal, in whole or in part?

Whenever the Secretary rejects a final construction project proposal in whole or in part, the Secretary must:

(a) Send the Self-Governance Tribe a timely written notice of rejection that shall set forth specific finding(s) that clearly demonstrates, or that is supported by controlling legal authority supporting the rejection;

(b) Within 20 days, provide all documents relied on in making the rejection decision to the Self-Governance Tribe;

(c) Provide assistance to the Self-Governance Tribe to overcome any objections stated in the written notice of rejection;

(d) Provide the Self-Governance Tribe with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal of the decision to reject the final construction contract proposal, under the regulations set forth in subpart P of this part, except that the Self-Governance Tribe may, in lieu of filing an appeal, initiate an action in Federal district court and proceed directly under sections 511 [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-10] and 110(a) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450m-1(a)]. With respect to any hearing or appeal or civil action conducted pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall have the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence the validity of the grounds for rejecting the final construction project proposal (or portion thereof); and

(e) Provide the Self-Governance Tribe with the option of entering into the severable portions of a final proposed construction project agreement (including a lesser funding amount) that the Secretary did not reject, subject to any additional alterations necessary to conform the construction project agreement to the severed provisions. Exercising this option does not affect the Self-Governance Tribe's right to appeal the portion of the final construction project proposal that was rejected by the Secretary.
