###### § 59.7 What criteria will the Department of Health and Human Services use to decide which family planning services projects to fund and in what amount?

(a) Within the limits of funds available for these purposes, the Secretary may award grants for the establishment and operation of those projects which will in the Department's judgment best promote the purposes of section 1001 of the Act, taking into account:

(1) The number of clients, and, in particular, the number of low-income clients to be served;

(2) The extent to which family planning services are needed locally;

(3) The ability of the applicant to advance health equity;

(4) The relative need of the applicant;

(5) The capacity of the applicant to make rapid and effective use of the federal assistance;

(6) The adequacy of the applicant's facilities and staff;

(7) The relative availability of non-federal resources within the community to be served and the degree to which those resources are committed to the project; and

(8) The degree to which the project plan adequately provides for the requirements set forth in these regulations.

(b) The Secretary shall determine the amount of any award on the basis of an estimate of the sum necessary for the performance of the project. No grant may be made for less than 90 percent of the project's costs, as so estimated, unless the grant is to be made for a project which was supported, under section 1001, for less than 90 percent of its costs in fiscal year 1975. In that case, the grant shall not be for less than the percentage of costs covered by the grant in fiscal year 1975.

(c) No grant may be made for an amount equal to 100 percent for the project's estimated costs.
