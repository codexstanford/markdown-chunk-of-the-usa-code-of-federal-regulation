###### § 59.206 Evaluation and grant award.

(a) Within the limits of funds available for such purpose, the Secretary may award grants to assist in the establishment and operation of those projects which will in his judgment best promote the purposes of section 1003 of the Act, taking into account:

(1) The extent to which a training program will increase the delivery of services to people, particularly low-income groups, with a high percentage of unmet need for family planning services;

(2) The extent to which the training program promises to fulfill the family planning services delivery needs of the area to be served, which may include, among other things:

(i) Development of a capability within family planning service projects to provide pre- and in-service training to their own staffs;

(ii) Improvement of the family planning services delivery skills of family planning and health services personnel;

(iii) Improvement in the utilization and career development of paraprofessional and paramedical manpower in family planning services;

(iv) Expansion of family planning services, particularly in rural areas, through new or improved approaches to program planning and deployment of resources;

(3) The capacity of the applicant to make rapid and effective use of such assistance;

(4) The administrative and management capability and competence of the applicant;

(5) The competence of the project staff in relation to the services to be provided; and

(6) The degree to which the project plan adequately provides for the requirements set forth in § 59.205.

(b) The amount of any award shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of his estimate of the sum necessary for all or a designated portion of direct project costs plus an additional amount for indirect costs, if any, which will be calculated by the Secretary either: (1) On the basis of his estimate of the actual indirect costs reasonably related to the project, or (2) on the basis of a percentage of all, or a portion of, the estimated direct costs of the project when there are reasonable assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed the approximate actual indirect costs. Such award may include an estimated provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs (such as travel or supply costs) subject to upward (within the limits of available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has been determined by the Secretary.

(c) Allowability of costs shall be in conformance with the applicable cost principles prescribed by 45 CFR part 75, subpart E.

(d) All grant awards shall be in writing, shall set forth the amount of funds granted and the period for which support is recommended.

(e) Neither the approval of any project nor any grant award shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved project or portion thereof. For continuation support, grantees must make separate application annually at such times and in such form as the Secretary may direct.
