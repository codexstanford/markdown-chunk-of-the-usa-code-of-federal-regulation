###### § 57.213a Loan cancellation reimbursement.

(a) For loans made prior to October 22, 1985, in the event that insufficient funds are available to the Secretary in any fiscal year to enable him or her to pay to all schools their proportionate shares of all loans and interest canceled under this subpart for practice in a shortage area, death, or disability:

(1) Each school will be paid an amount bearing the same ratio to the total of the funds available for that purpose as the principal of loans canceled by that school in that fiscal year bears to the total principal of loans canceled by all schools in that year; and

(2) Any additional amounts to which a school is entitled will be paid by the Secretary at the time of distribution of the assets of the school's Fund under section 728 of the Act.

(b) For loans made on or after October 22, 1985, a school may assess the borrower a charge to insure against the loss of the institutional share of a loan canceled due to the borrower's death or permanent and total disability. The school must develop annually a rate which reflects its cancellation experience. This charge shall not exceed .6 percent of the loan amount. Funds collected under this provision must be maintained by the school in an insured, interest-bearing account (with any earned interest credited to this insurance fund), and used only to reimburse the school for the institutional share of any HPSL loan made on or after October 22, 1985, that is canceled due to the borrower's death or permanent and total disability. A school is not required to establish a separate bank account, but is required to maintain separate accountability.
