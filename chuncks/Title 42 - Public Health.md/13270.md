(1) Services of the enrollee's attending physician if the physician is an employee or contractor of the HMO or CMP and is not employed by or under contract to the enrollee's hospice.

(2) Services not related to the treatment of the terminal condition for which the enrollee elected hospice care or a condition related to the terminal condition.

(3) Services furnished after the revocation or expiration of the enrollee's hospice election until the full monthly capitation payments begin again.

(c) Payment for hospice care services furnished to Medicare enrollees of an HMO or CMP is made to the Medicare-participating hospice elected by the enrollee.
