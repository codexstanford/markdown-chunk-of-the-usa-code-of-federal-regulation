###### § 51.7 Eligibility for protection and advocacy services.

In accordance with section 105(a)(1)(C) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 10805(a)(1)(C)) and the priorities established by the P&A system governing authority, together with the advisory council, pursuant to section 105(c)(2)(B) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 10805(c)(2)(B)), allotments may be used:

(a) To provide protection and advocacy services for:

(1) Individuals with mental illness as defined in 42 U.S.C. 10802(4) and 10805(a), including persons who report matters which occurred while they were individuals with mental illness;

(2) Persons who were individuals with mental illness who are residents of the State, but only with respect to matters which occur within 90 days after the date of the discharge of such individuals from a facility providing care or treatment; and

(3) Individuals with mental illness in Federal facilities rendering care or treatment who request representation by the eligible P&A system. Representation may be requested by an individual with mental illness, or by a legal guardian, conservator or legal representative.

(b) To provide representation of clients in civil commitment proceedings if the P&A system is acting on behalf of an eligible individual to obtain judicial review of his or her commitment in order to appeal or otherwise challenge acts or omissions which have subjected the individual to abuse or neglect or otherwise violated his or her rights. This restriction does not prevent a P&A system from representing clients in commitment or recommitment proceedings using other resources so long as this representation does not conflict with responsibilities under the Act.
