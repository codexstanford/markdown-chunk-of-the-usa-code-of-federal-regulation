(b) A respondent must exhaust all administrative appeal procedures established by the Secretary or required by law before a respondent may bring an action in Federal court, as provided in section 1128A(e) of the Act, concerning any penalty, assessment, or exclusion imposed pursuant to this part.

(c) Administrative remedies are exhausted when a decision becomes final in accordance with 42 CFR 1005.21(j).
