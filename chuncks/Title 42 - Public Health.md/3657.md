(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, NIOSH authorized representatives will contact an official representative of the place of employment prior to any site visits and will provide the details of why an investigation of the place of employment is being conducted. Prior to the initiation of a site visit of a place of employment, representatives of the following organizations will be advised of the site visit and the reason for its conduct:

(1) The appropriate State agency designated under section 18(b) of the OSH Act, or if no State agency has been designated under the OSH Act and in the case of the FMSH Act, the State agency which, in the judgment of NIOSH, would benefit the most from the investigation's findings;

(2) The local union at the place of employment, if any;

(3) The appropriate Assistant Regional Director, when investigations are conducted under the OSH Act;

(4) The appropriate MSHA District Office when investigations are conducted under the FMSH Act.

(b) Advance notice of site visits will not be given to the place of employment or local union at the place of employment when, in the judgment of the NIOSH authorized representatives, giving such notice would adversely affect the validity and effectiveness of an investigation. Those individuals and organizations specified in § 85a.4(a)(1), (a)(3), and (a)(4) will be notified prior to the initiation of such a site visit. After the site visit has been initiated, and, as soon as possible thereafter, the NIOSH authorized representatives will contact the organizations specified in § 85a.4(a)(2) concerning the nature and details of the site visit.

(c) In those instances where site visits are not necessary to the conduct of an investigation, the NIOSH authorized representatives will contact an official representative of the place of employment either verbally or through a written communication and provide the details of why an investigation of the place of employment is being conducted. If appropriate, the NIOSH authorized representatives will contact those individuals or organizations stipulated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section about the nature and details of the investigation.
