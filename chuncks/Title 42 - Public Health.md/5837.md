###### § 405.420 Requirements of the opt-out affidavit.

An affidavit under this subpart must:

(a) Be in writing and be signed by the physician or practitioner.

(b) Contain the physician's or practitioner's full name, address, telephone number, national provider identifier (NPI) or billing number, if one has been assigned, uniform provider identification number (UPIN) if one has been assigned, or, if neither an NPI nor a UPIN has been assigned, the physician's or practitioner's tax identification number (TIN).

(c) State that, except for emergency or urgent care services (as specified in § 405.440), during the opt-out period the physician or practitioner will provide services to Medicare beneficiaries only through private contracts that meet the criteria of paragraph § 405.415 for services that, but for their provision under a private contract, would have been Medicare-covered services.

(d) State that the physician or practitioner will not submit a claim to Medicare for any service furnished to a Medicare beneficiary during the opt-out period, nor will the physician or practitioner permit any entity acting on his or her behalf to submit a claim to Medicare for services furnished to a Medicare beneficiary, except as specified in § 405.440.

(e) State that, during the opt-out period, the physician or practitioner understands that he or she may receive no direct or indirect Medicare payment for services that he or she furnishes to Medicare beneficiaries with whom he or she has privately contracted, whether as an individual, an employee of an organization, a partner in a partnership, under a reassignment of benefits, or as payment for a service furnished to a Medicare beneficiary under a Medicare Advantage plan.

(f) State that a physician or practitioner who opts-out of Medicare acknowledges that, during the opt-out period, his or her services are not covered under Medicare and that no Medicare payment may be made to any entity for his or her services, directly or on a capitated basis.

(g) State a promise by the physician or practitioner to the effect that, during the opt-out period, the physician or practitioner agrees to be bound by the terms of both the affidavit and the private contracts that he or she has entered into.

(h) Acknowledge that the physician or practitioner recognizes that the terms of the affidavit apply to all Medicare-covered items and services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries by the physician or practitioner during the opt-out period (except for emergency or urgent care services furnished to the beneficiaries with whom he or she has not previously privately contracted) without regard to any payment arrangements the physician or practitioner may make.

(i) With respect to a physician who has signed a Part B participation agreement, acknowledge that such agreement terminates on the effective date of the affidavit.

(j) Acknowledge that the physician or practitioner understands that a beneficiary who has not entered into a private contract and who requires emergency or urgent care services may not be asked to enter into a private contract with respect to receiving such services and that the rules of § 405.440 apply if the physician furnishes such services.
