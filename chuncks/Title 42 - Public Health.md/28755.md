###### § 1003.160 Waiver of exclusion.

(a) The OIG will consider a request from the administrator of a Federal health care program for a waiver of an exclusion imposed under this part as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The request must be in writing and from an individual directly responsible for administering the Federal health care program.

(b) If the OIG subsequently obtains information that the basis for a waiver no longer exists, the waiver will cease and the person will be fully excluded from the Federal health care programs for the remainder of the exclusion period, measured from the time the full exclusion would have been imposed if the waiver had not been granted.

(c) The OIG will notify the administrator of the Federal health care program whether his or her request for a waiver has been granted or denied.

(d) If a waiver is granted, it applies only to the program(s) for which waiver is requested.

(e) The decision to grant, deny, or rescind a waiver is not subject to administrative or judicial review.
