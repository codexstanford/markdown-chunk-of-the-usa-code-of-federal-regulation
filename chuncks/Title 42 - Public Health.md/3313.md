###### § 82.26 How will NIOSH report dose reconstruction results?

(a) NIOSH will provide dose reconstruction results to the claimant, DOL, and DOE in a report: "NIOSH Report of Dose Reconstruction under EEOICPA." The report itself will not provide information on probability of causation, which DOL must calculate to determine a recommended decision on the claim.

(b) The report will include the following information, as relevant:

(1) Annual dose estimates (or a fraction thereof) related to covered employment for each year from the date of initial radiation exposure at a covered facility to the date of cancer diagnosis;

(2) Separate dose estimates for acute and chronic exposures, different types of ionizing radiation, and internal and external doses, providing internal dose information only for the organ or tissue relevant to the primary cancer site(s) established in the claim;

(3) Uncertainty distributions associated with each dose estimated, as necessary;

(4) Explanation of each type of dose estimate included in terms of its relevance for estimating probability of causation;

(5) Identification of any information provided by the claimant relevant to dose estimation that NIOSH decided to omit from the basis for dose reconstruction, justification for the decision, and if possible, a quantitative estimate of the effect of the omission on the dose reconstruction results; and

(6) A summary and explanation of information and methods applied to produce the dose reconstruction estimates, including any factual findings and the evidence upon which those findings are based.

(c) As provided under § 82.10(l), NIOSH staff will conduct a closing interview with claimants to explain the dose reconstruction report.
