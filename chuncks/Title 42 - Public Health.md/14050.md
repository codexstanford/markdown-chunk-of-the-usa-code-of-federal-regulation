###### § 422.3 MA organizations' use of reinsurance.

(a) An MA organization may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for the cost of providing basic benefits to an individual enrollee in either of the following ways-

(1) The MA organization must retain risk for at least the first $10,000 in costs per individual enrollee for providing basic benefits during a contract year; or

(2) If the MA organization uses insurance or makes other arrangements for sharing such costs proportionately on a per member per year first dollar basis, the MA organization must retain risk based on the following:

(i) The actuarially equivalent value of the retained risk is greater than or equal to the value of risk retained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(ii) The MA organization makes a determination of actuarial equivalence based on reasonable actuarial methods. For example, a reasonable method for determining actuarial equivalence would be to equate the percentage of net claim costs that the MA organization would retain under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(i) of this section.

(b) In evaluating compliance with section 1855(b) of the Act and with paragraph (a) of this section, CMS will consider a parent organization and any of its subsidiaries to be part of the MA organization.

(c) The type of payment arrangement used between an MA organization and contracting physicians, other health professionals or institutions for the financial risk specified in section 1855(b)(4) of the Act (that is, the financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of basic benefit by those physicians or other health professionals or through those institutions) is not limited by paragraph (a) of this section.
