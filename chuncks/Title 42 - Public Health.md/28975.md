#### PART 1008 - ADVISORY OPINIONS BY THE OIG
##### Subpart F - Scope and Effect of OIG Advisory Opinions
###### § 1008.59 Range of the advisory opinion.

(a) An advisory opinion will state only the OIG's opinion regarding the subject matter of the request. If the arrangement for which an advisory opinion is requested is subject to approval or regulation by any other Federal, State or local government agency, such advisory opinion may not be taken to indicate the OIG's views on the legal or factual issues that may be raised before that agency. The OIG will not provide any legal opinion on questions or issues regarding an authority which is vested in other Federal, State or local government agencies.

(b) An advisory opinion issued under this part will not bind or obligate any agency other than the Department. It will not affect the requestor's, or anyone else's, obligations to any other agency, or under any statutory or regulatory provision other than that which is the specific subject matter of the advisory opinion.
