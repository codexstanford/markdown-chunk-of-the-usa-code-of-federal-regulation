If an enrollee in an MA plan receives a service from a Federally qualified health center (FQHC) that has a written agreement with the MA organization offering the plan concerning the provision of this service (including the agreement required under section 1857(e)(3) of the Act and as codified in § 422.527)-

(a) CMS will pay the amount determined under section 1833(a)(3)(B) of the Act directly to the FQHC at a minimum on a quarterly basis, less the amount the FQHC would receive for the MA enrollee from the MA organization (which includes the cost sharing amount the FQHC may charge an enrollee, as established in the contract between the FQHC and the MA organization); and

(b) CMS will not reduce the amount of the monthly payments under this section as a result of the application of paragraph (a) of this section.
