####### § 137.307 What Federal environmental responsibilities remain with the Secretary when a Self-Governance Tribe assumes Federal environmental responsibilities for construction projects under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8]?

(a) All environmental responsibilities for Federal actions not directly related to construction projects assumed by Tribes under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8] remain with the Secretary. Federal agencies, including the IHS, retain responsibility for ensuring their environmental review procedures meet the requirements of NEPA, NHPA and related provisions of law, as called for in § 137.297.

(b) The Secretary will provide information updating and changing IHS agency environmental review policy and procedures to all Self-Governance Tribes implementing a construction project agreement, and to other Indian Tribes upon request. If a Self-Governance Tribe participating under section 509 of the Act [25 U.S.C. 458aaa-8] does not wish to receive this information, it must notify the Secretary in writing. As resources permit, at the request of the Self-Governance Tribe, the Secretary will provide technical assistance to the Self-governance tribe to assist the Self-governance Tribe in carrying out Federal environmental responsibilities.
