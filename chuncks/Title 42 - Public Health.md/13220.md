###### § 417.556 Apportionment: Provider services furnished by the HMO or CMP through arrangements with others.

The Medicare share of the cost of covered services furnished to Medicare enrollees through arrangements with providers other than those specified in § 417.554 must be determined as follows:

(a) The Medicare share must be based on the cost the HMO or CMP pays the provider under their arrangement, to the extent that cost is reasonable and within the limits established by §§ 417.534 through 417.548.

(b) Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, apportionment must be on the same approved basis that is used by the provider for Medicare beneficiaries who are not Medicare enrollees of the HMO or CMP, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in § 417.548.

(c) If, because of the special nature or terms of the HMO's or CMP's arrangement with the provider, apportionment on the basis specified in paragraph (b) of this section would result in Medicare's bearing the costs of furnishing services to individuals other than the HMO's or CMP's Medicare enrollees, apportionment must be on another basis that is approved by CMS and that will ensure that Medicare does not pay any of the cost of furnishing services to individuals who are not Medicare enrollees of the HMO or CMP.

(d) If the HMO or CMP elects to have providers reimbursed by the HMO's or CMP's Medicare intermediary, the Medicare share is the amount the intermediary paid the provider.
