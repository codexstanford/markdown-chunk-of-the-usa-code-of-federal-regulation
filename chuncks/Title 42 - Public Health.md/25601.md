###### § 489.42 Payment of offset amounts to beneficiary or other person.

(a) In order to carry out the commitment to refund amounts incorrectly collected, CMS may determine that amounts offset in accordance with § 489.41 are to be paid directly to the beneficiary or other person from whom the provider received the incorrect collection, if:

(2) The provider agreement has been terminated in accordance with the provisions of subpart E of this part.

(b) Before making a determination to make payment under paragraph (a) of this section, CMS will give written notice to the provider (1) explaining that an incorrect collection was made and the amount; (2) requesting the provider to refund the incorrect collection to the beneficiary or other person; and (3) advising of CMS's intention to make a determination under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The notice will afford an authorized official of the provider an opportunity to submit, within 20 days from the date on the notice, written statement or evidence with respect to the incorrect collection and/or offset amounts. CMS will consider any written statement or evidence in making a determination.

(d) Payment to a beneficiary or other person under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) Will not exceed the amount of the incorrect collection; and

(2) May be considered as payment made to the provider.
