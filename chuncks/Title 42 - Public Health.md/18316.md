(1) Eligibility requirements concerning the structure and governance of ACOs.

(2) Calculation of sharing rate.

(b) In those instances where there are changes in law or regulations, the ACO will be required to submit to CMS for review and approval, as a supplement to its original application, an explanation detailing how it will modify its processes to address these changes in law or regulations.

(c) If an ACO does not modify its processes to address a change in law or regulations, it will be placed on a CAP. If the ACO fails to effectuate the necessary modifications while under the CAP, the ACO will be terminated from the Shared Savings Program using the procedures in § 425.218.

(d) An ACO will be permitted to terminate its agreement, in those instances where Shared Savings Program statutory and regulatory standards are established during the agreement period which the ACO believes will impact its ability to continue to participate in the Shared Savings Program.
