(a) In August 1972, the individual was entitled to OASDI and-

(1) He was receiving OAA, AB, APTD, or AABD; or

(2) He would have been eligible for one of those programs except that he had not applied, and the Medicaid plan covered this optional group; or

(b) The individual would currently be eligible for SSI or a State supplement except that the increase in OASDI under Pub. L. 92-336 raised his income over the limit allowed under SSI. This includes an individual who-

(1) Meets all current SSI requirements except for the requirement to file an application; or
