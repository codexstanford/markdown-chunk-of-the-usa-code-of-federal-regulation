(c) CMS, directly or through its agents, sends quarterly or monthly premium bills and includes an addressed return envelope with the bill.

(d) The individual must-

(1) Send a check or money order that is drawn payable to "CMS Medicare Insurance" and show the enrollee's name and claim number as it appears on the Medicare card; and
