A State plan must provide that-

(b) State funds will be used to pay at least 40 percent of the non-Federal share of total expenditures under the plan; and

(c) State and Federal funds will be apportioned among the political subdivisions of the State on a basis that assures that-

(1) Individuals in similar circumstances will be treated similarly throughout the State; and

(2) If there is local financial participation, lack of funds from local sources will not result in lowering the amount, duration, scope, or quality of services or level of administration under the plan in any part of the State.
