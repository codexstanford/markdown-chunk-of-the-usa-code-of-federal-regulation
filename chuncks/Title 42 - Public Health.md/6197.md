####### § 405.1120 Filing briefs with the Council.

Upon request, the Council will give the party requesting review, as well as all other parties, a reasonable opportunity to file briefs or other written statements about the facts and law relevant to the case. Any party who submits a brief or statement must send a copy to all of the other parties. Unless the party requesting review files the brief or other statement with the request for review, the time beginning with the date of receipt of the request to submit the brief and ending with the date the brief is received by the Council will not be counted toward the adjudication timeframe set forth in § 405.1100. The Council may also request, but not require, CMS or its contractor to file a brief or position paper if the Council determines that it is necessary to resolve the issues in the case. The Council will not draw any adverse inference if CMS or a contractor either participates, or decides not to participate in Council review.
