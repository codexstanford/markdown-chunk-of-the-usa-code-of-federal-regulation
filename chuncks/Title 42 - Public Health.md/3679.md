###### § 86.14 Evaluation and grant award.

Within the limits of funds available for such purpose the Secretary may award grants to assist in the establishment and operation of those projects which will in his judgment best promote the purposes of section 21(a)(1) of the Act, taking into account:

(a) In the case of long-term training grants:

(1) The need for training in the area or areas of study outlined in the application;

(2) The degree to which the proposal represents a strengthening or expansion of the applicant's program in such areas;

(3) The record of the applicant's effectiveness in training in these or related areas as indicated, among other things, by the placement of its graduates;

(4) The competence of the project staff in relation to the service to be provided;

(5) The reasonableness of the budget in relation to the proposed project;

(6) The applicant's resources, including equipment, facilities, and funds, available for the project;

(7) The current and potential availability of students in the area of study to be offered and their prospective employability as a result of the proposed training;

(8) The extent to which the applicant expects to absorb faculty positions initiated as a result of the grant; and

(9) The degree to which the project adequately provides for the requirements set forth in § 86.13(a).

(b) In the case of short-term training:

(1) The relationship of the contents of the course to the current and emergency training needs to carry out the purposes of the Act;

(2) The qualifications of the instructional staff;

(3) The speed with which the training can be put to use by the persons proposed to be trained;

(4) The reasonableness of the budget in relation to the proposed project;

(5) The success of previous offerings of this course, or related courses;

(6) Evidence of ability to recruit trainees and the estimated number to be enrolled during each course offering; and

(7) The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for the requirements set forth in § 86.13(b).

(c) In the case of educational resource center grants:

(1) The criteria set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(2) The degree to which the proposed project adequately provides for the requirements set forth in § 86.13(c).

(d) The amount of any award shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of his estimate of the sum necessary for all or a designated portion of direct project costs plus an additional amount for indirect costs, if any, which will be calculated by the Secretary either (1) on the basis of his estimate of the actual indirect costs reasonably related to the project, or (2) on the basis of a percentage, not to exceed 8 percent, of all, or a portion of, the estimated direct costs of the project when there are reasonable assurances that the use of such percentage will not exceed the approximate actual indirect costs. Such award may include an estimated provisional amount for indirect costs or for designated direct costs (such as travel or supply costs) subject to upward (within the limits of available funds) as well as downward adjustments to actual costs when the amount properly expended by the grantee for provisional items has been determined by the Secretary.

(e) All grant awards shall be in writing, shall set forth the amount of funds granted and the period for which support is recommended.

(f) Neither the approval of any project nor any grant award shall commit or obligate the United States in any way to make any additional, supplemental, continuation, or other award with respect to any approved project or portion thereof. For continuation support, grantees must make separate application annually at such times and in such form as the Secretary may direct.
