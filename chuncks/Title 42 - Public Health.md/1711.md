#### PART 51d - MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PROCEDURES
##### § 51d.5 How is an emergency determined to exist?

(a) In making a decision as to whether a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists for purposes of section 501(m) of the PHS Act, the Secretary, using discretion, will consider all relevant factors, but at a minimum the following must exist:

(1) Existing State, Tribal and local systems for mental health and/or substance abuse services are overwhelmed or unable to meet the existing mental health or substance abuse needs of the local community at issue; and

(2) This inability to meet the mental health and/or substance abuse service needs of a local community is the direct consequence of a clear precipitating event. This precipitating event must:

(i) Have a sudden, rapid onset and a definite conclusion, such as:

(A) A natural disaster (including, but not limited to, a hurricane, tornado, storm, flood, earthquake, fire, drought, or other natural catastrophe); or

(B) A technological disaster (including, but not limited to, a chemical spill, a major industrial accident, or a transportation accident); or

(C) A criminal act with significant casualties (including, but not limited to, a domestic act of terrorism, a hostage situation, or an incident of mass violence including school shootings and riots); and

(ii) Result in significant:

(A) Death,

(B) Injury,

(C) Exposure to life-threatening circumstances,

(D) Hardship,

(E) Suffering,

(F) Loss of property, or

(G) Loss of community infrastructure (e.g., loss of treatment facilities, staff, public transportation and/or utilities, or isolation from services); and

(3) No other local, State, Tribal or Federal funding is available to adequately address the specific level of need resulting from the precipitating event and resulting emergency mental health and/or substance abuse service needs of the impacted community.

(b) In making a determination that a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists, the Secretary will consider the certification and written statements provided in accordance with § 51d.4(a)(1) or (b)(1), and other information independently available to the Secretary.

(c) Once the Secretary determines that a mental health or substance abuse emergency exists, the Secretary may exercise discretion to make awards to enable public entities to respond to the emergency, within the limits of funds available.
