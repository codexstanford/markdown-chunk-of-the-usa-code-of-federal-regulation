(3) Granting enrollees the right to terminate enrollment without cause and notifying the affected enrollees of their right to disenroll.

(5) Suspension of payment for beneficiaries enrolled after the effective date of the sanction and until CMS or the State is satisfied that the reason for imposition of the sanction no longer exists and is not likely to recur.
