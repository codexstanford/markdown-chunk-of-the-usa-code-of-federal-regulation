####### et seq.;

(a) Payment to providers and suppliers not covered by 42 CFR part 136 subpart D, for any level of care authorized under part 136, subpart C by a Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) program of the IHS; or authorized by a Tribe or Tribal organization carrying out a PRC program of the IHS under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended, Public Law 93-638, 25 U.S.C. 450or authorized for purchase under § 136.31 by an urban Indian organization (as that term is defined in 25 U.S.C. 1603(h)) (hereafter collectively "I/T/U"), shall be determined based on the applicable method in this section:

(1) If a specific amount has been negotiated with a specific provider or supplier or its agent by the I/T/U, the I/T/U will pay that amount, provided that such amount is equal to or better than the provider or supplier's Most Favored Customer (MFC) rate, as evidenced by commercial price lists or paid invoices and other related pricing and discount data to ensure that the I/T/U is receiving a fair and reasonable price. The MFC rate limitation shall not apply if:

(i) The prices offered to the I/T/U are fair and reasonable, as determined by the I/T/U, even though comparable discounts were not negotiated; and

(ii) The award is otherwise in the best interest of the I/T/U, as determined by the I/T/U.

(2) If an amount has not been negotiated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the I/T/U will pay the lowest of the following amounts:

(i) The applicable Medicare payment amount, including payment according to a fee schedule, a prospective payment system or based on reasonable cost ("Medicare rate") for the period in which the service was provided, or in the event of a Medicare waiver, the payment amount will be calculated in accordance with such waiver.

(ii) An amount negotiated by a repricing agent if the provider or supplier is participating within the repricing agent's network and the I/T/U has a pricing arrangement or contract with that repricing agent.

(iii) An amount not to exceed the provider or supplier's MFC rate, as evidenced by commercial price lists or paid invoices and other related pricing and discount data to ensure that the I/T/U is receiving a fair and reasonable price, but only to the extent such evidence is reasonably accessible and available to the I/T/U.

(3) In the event that a Medicare rate does not exist for an authorized item or service, and no other payment methodology provided for in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section are accessible or available, the allowable amount shall be deemed to be 65% of authorized charges.

(b) Coordination of benefits and limitation on recovery: If an I/T/U has authorized payment for items and services provided to an individual who is eligible for benefits under Medicare, Medicaid, or another third party payer-

(1) The I/T/U is the payer of last resort under 25 U.S.C. 1623(b);

(2) If there are any third party payers, the I/T/U will pay the amount for which the patient is being held responsible after the provider or supplier of services has coordinated benefits and all other alternate resources have been considered and paid, including applicable co-payments, deductibles, and coinsurance that are owed by the patient;

(3) The maximum payment by theI/T/U will be only that portion of the payment amount determined under this section not covered by any other payer;

(4) The I/T/U payment will not exceed the rate calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section (plus applicable cost sharing); and

(5) When payment is made by Medicaid it is considered payment in full and there will be no additional payment made by the I/T/U to the amount paid by Medicaid.

(c) Authorized services: Payment shall be made only for those items and services authorized by an I/T/U consistent with this part 136 or section 503(a) of the IHCIA, Public Law 94-437, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 1653(a).

(d) No additional charges:

(1) If an amount has not been negotiated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the health care provider or supplier shall be deemed to have accepted the applicable payment amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as payment in full if:

(i) The services were provided based on a Referral, as defined in § 136.202; or,

(ii) The health care provider or supplier submits a Notification of a Claim for payment to the I/T/U; or

(iii) The health care provider or supplier accepts payment for the provision of services from the I/T/U.

(2) A payment made and accepted in accordance with this section shall constitute payment in full and the provider or its agent, or supplier or its agent, may not impose any additional charge-

(i) On the individual for I/T/U authorized items and services; or

(ii) For information requested by the I/T/U or its agent or fiscal intermediary for the purposes of payment determinations or quality assurance.

(e) IHS will not adjudicate a notification of a claim that does not contain the information required by § 136.24 with an approval or denial, except that IHS may request further information from the individual, or as applicable, the provider or supplier, necessary to make a decision. A notification of a claim meeting the requirements specified herein does not guarantee payment.

(f) No service shall be authorized and no payment shall be issued in excess of the rate authorized by this section.
