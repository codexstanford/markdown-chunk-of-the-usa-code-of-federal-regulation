(a) The hearing must be held within 10 days of the date of the notice referred to in § 137.440 unless the Self-Governance Tribe agrees to a later date.

(b) If possible, the hearing will be held at the office of the Self-Governance Tribe. If the hearing is held more than 50 miles from the office of the Self-Governance Tribe, the Secretary must arrange to pay transportation costs and per diem for incidental expenses. This will allow for adequate representation of the Self-Governance Tribe.
