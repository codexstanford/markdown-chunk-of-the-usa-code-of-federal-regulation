(4) A description of the training and research expertise, appropriate facilities and ongoing training and research activities in occupational safety and health areas.

(5) A description of its program for conducting education and training of occupational health physicians, occupational health nurses, industrial hygienists/engineers and safety personnel. There shall be full-time students in each of these core disciplines, with a goal of a minimum total of 30 full-time students.
