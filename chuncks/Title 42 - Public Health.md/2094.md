####### Provided,

(a) Within the limits of funds determined by the Secretary to be available for such purpose, the Secretary may award grants under this subpart to applicants therefor which, in his judgment, will provide needed health services in a catchment area not served by another project funded under this part and meet the applicable requirements of section 319(c)(1)(B) of the Act and this part, in accordance with priorities established pursuant to section 319(b) of the Act and § 56.107 of subpart A of this part;That in the case of applicants which propose to serve substantially the same catchment areas or where available funds are insufficient to fund all approvable applications within a priority category specified in § 56.107,

(1) Priority shall be given to applications submitted by community-based organizations which are representative of the population to be served by the project. For purposes of this paragraph, an applicant shall be deemed to be such an organization if it provides a formal mechanism (such as membership on the organization's governing body or membership on an advisory body) which gives migratory and seasonal agricultural workers and their families significant involvement in the formulation of the organization's policies; and

(2) Where all such applicants are community-based organizations representative of the population to be served by the project, the Secretary shall award the grant to the applicants which will, in his judgment, best promote the purposes of section 319(c)(1)(B) of the Act and the applicable regulations of this part, taking into account with respect to each application:

(i) The degree to which the proposed project satisfactorily provides for the elements set forth in § 56.203;

(ii) The administrative and management capability of the applicant;

(iii) The extent to which community resources will be utilized in the project; and

(iv) The degree to which the applicant intends to integrate services supported by a grant under this part with health services provided under other federally assisted health services or reimbursement programs or projects.

(b) The Secretary shall award no more than one grant under this subpart for the same project.
