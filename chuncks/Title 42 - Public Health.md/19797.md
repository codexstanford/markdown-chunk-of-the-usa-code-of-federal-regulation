(2) The agency received reimbursement from a liable third party; or

(3) A private insurer would have been obligated to pay for the service except that its insurance contract limits or excludes payments if the individual is eligible for Medicaid.

(b) FFP is available at the 50 percent rate for the agency's expenditures in carrying out the requirements of this subpart.

This payment may be reduced by the total amount needed to meet the incentive payment in § 433.153.
