###### § 136a.34 Care and treatment of people losing eligibility.

(a) Individuals who lose their eligibility on September 16, 1988, (end of the grace period) and on that date are actively undergoing treatment may still be provided services for a limited period in the following circumstances;

(1) Inpatients in IHS and IHS funded facilities and those receiving inpatient care under contract, including contract health services, may continue to receive such care and necessary follow-up services at Indian Health Service expense until the need for hospitalization and follow-up services has ended as determined by the responsible Indian Health Service or tribal physician, all other conditions being met including medical priorities;

(2) Those actively undergoing a course of outpatient treatment either in Indian Health Service and Indian Health Service funded facilities or through contract health services, termination of which would impair the health of the individual patient, may continue to receive the treatment at Indian Health Service expense for a reasonable length of time, until the course of treatment reaches a point where it may safely be terminated or the patient transferred to other providers as determined by the responsible Indian Health Service or tribal physician, all other conditions being met including medical priorities.

(3) Those under treatment for chronic degenerative conditions may be provided additional treatment at Indian Health Service expense for no longer than 1 year beyond the end of the grace period notwithstanding any determination that it was otherwise safe to transfer treatment to other providers, all other conditions being met including medical priorities.

(b) All patients receiving care under paragraph (a) of this section shall be notified in writing that, after discharge from care provided under any of the above circumstances, they will no longer be eligible for services as Indian Health Service beneficiaries. Such notice shall include an explanation of their appeal rights as provided in § 36a.14 of this part. These patients shall be offered assistance in locating other health care providers and medical assistance programs.
