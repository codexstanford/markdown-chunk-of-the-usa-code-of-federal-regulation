To enter without delay any place of employment for the purpose of conducting investigations of all pertinent processes, conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, equipment, and materials within the place of employment; and to conduct medical examinations, anthropometric measurements and functional tests of employees within the place of employment as may be directly related to the specific investigation being conducted. Such investigations will be conducted in a reasonable manner, during regular working hours or at other reasonable times and within reasonable limits.
