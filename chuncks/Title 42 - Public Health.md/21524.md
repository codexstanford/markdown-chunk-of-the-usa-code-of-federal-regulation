(iii) Surveyors are professionals who use their judgment, in concert with Federal forms and procedures, to determine compliance;

(iv) Federal procedures are used by all surveyors to ensure uniform and consistent application and interpretation of Federal requirements;

(v) Federal forms are used by all surveyors to ensure proper recording of findings and to document the basis for the findings.
