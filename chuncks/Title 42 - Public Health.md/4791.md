###### § 137.237 How are funds redistributed when an Indian Tribe fully or partially withdraws from a compact or funding agreement and elects to enter a contract or compact?

When an Indian Tribe eligible to enter into a contract under Title I or a compact or funding agreement under Title V fully or partially withdraws from a participating inter-Tribal consortium or Tribal organization, and has proposed to enter into a contract or compact and funding agreement covering the withdrawn funds:

(a) The withdrawing Indian Tribe is entitled to its Tribal share of funds supporting those PSFAs that the Indian Tribe will be carrying out under its own contract or compact and funding agreement (calculated on the same basis as the funds were initially allocated in the funding agreement of the inter-Tribal consortium or Tribal organization); and

(b) the funds referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must be transferred from the funding agreement of the inter-Tribal consortium or Tribal organization, on the condition that the provisions of sections 102 [25 U.S.C. 450f] and 105(i) of the Act [25 U.S.C. 450j], as appropriate, apply to the withdrawing Indian Tribe.
