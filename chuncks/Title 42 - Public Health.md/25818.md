###### § 493.45 Requirements for a registration certificate.

Laboratories performing only waived tests, PPM procedures, or any combination of these tests, are not required to obtain a registration certificate.

(a) A registration certificate is required-(1) Initially for all laboratories performing test procedures of moderate complexity (other than the subcategory of PPM procedures) or high complexity, or both; and

(2) For all laboratories that have been issued a certificate of waiver or certificate for PPM procedures that intend to perform tests of moderate or high complexity, or both, in addition to those tests listed in § 493.15(c) or specified as PPM procedures.

(b) HHS will issue a registration certificate if the laboratory-

(1) Complies with the requirements of § 493.43;

(2) Agrees to notify HHS or its designee within 30 days of any changes in ownership, name, location, director or technical supervisor (laboratories performing high complexity testing only);

(3) Agrees to treat proficiency testing samples in the same manner as it treats patient specimens; and

(4) Remits the fee for the registration certificate, as specified in subpart F of this part.

(c) Prior to the expiration of the registration certificate, a laboratory must-

(1) Remit the certificate fee specified in subpart F of this part;

(2) Be inspected by HHS as specified in subpart Q of this part; and

(3) Demonstrate compliance with the applicable requirements of this subpart and subparts H, J, K, M, and Q of this part.

(d) In accordance with subpart R of this part, HHS will initiate suspension or revocation of a laboratory's registration certificate and will deny the laboratory's application for a certificate of compliance for failure to comply with the requirements set forth in this subpart. HHS may also impose certain alternative sanctions. In addition, failure to meet the requirements of this subpart will result in suspension of payments under Medicare and Medicaid as specified in subpart R of this part.

(e) A registration certificate is-

(1) Valid for a period of no more than two years or until such time as an inspection to determine program compliance can be conducted, whichever is shorter; and

(2) Not renewable; however, the registration certificate may be reissued if compliance has not been determined by HHS prior to the expiration date of the registration certificate.

(f) In the event of a noncompliance determination resulting in an HHS denial of a laboratory's certificate of compliance application, HHS will provide the laboratory with a statement of grounds on which the noncompliance determination is based and offer an opportunity for appeal as provided in subpart R.

(g) If the laboratory requests a hearing within the time specified by HHS, it retains its registration certificate or reissued registration certificate until a decision is made by an administrative law judge as provided in subpart R of this part, except when HHS finds that conditions at the laboratory pose an imminent and serious risk to human health.

(h) For laboratories receiving payment from the Medicare or Medicaid program, such payments will be suspended on the effective date specified in the notice to the laboratory of denial of the certificate application even if there has been no appeals decision issued.
