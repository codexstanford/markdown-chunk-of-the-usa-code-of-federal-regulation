###### § 411.379 When CMS accepts a request.

(a) Upon receiving a request for an advisory opinion, CMS promptly makes an initial determination of whether the request contains a level of detail sufficient for CMS to process the request.

(b) If CMS determines that the request submitted lacks details necessary for CMS to process the request, CMS will provide notification to the requestor within 15 working days of receiving the request.

(c) If the requestor provides the additional information CMS has requested, or otherwise resubmits the request, CMS processes the resubmission in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section as if it were an initial request for an advisory opinion.

(d) CMS formally accepts a request when CMS determines that the request (inclusive of any supplemental submissions) describes the arrangement at issue with sufficient detail and that the grounds for rejection of a request listed at § 411.370(e) do not apply. Upon accepting the request, CMS notifies the requestor by regular U.S. mail of the date that CMS formally accepts the request.

(e) The applicable time period that CMS has to issue an advisory opinion set forth in § 411.380(c) does not begin until CMS formally accepts the request for an advisory opinion.
