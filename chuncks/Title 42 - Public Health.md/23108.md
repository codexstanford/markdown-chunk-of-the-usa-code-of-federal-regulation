###### § 475.102 Requirements for performing case reviews.

(a) In determining whether or not an organization has demonstrated the ability to perform case review, CMS will take into consideration factors such as:

(1) The organization's proposed processes, capabilities, quantitative, and/or qualitative performance objectives and methodology to perform case reviews;

(2) The organization's proposed involvement of and access to physicians and practitioners in the QIO area with the appropriate expertise and specialization in the areas of health care related to case reviews;

(3) The organization's ability to take into consideration urban versus rural, local, and regional characteristics in the health care setting where the care under review was provided;

(4) The organization's ability to take into consideration evidence-based national clinical guidelines and professionally recognized standards of care; and

(5) The organization's access to qualified information technology (IT) expertise.

(b) In making determinations under this section, CMS may consider characteristics such as the organization's geographic location and size. CMS may also consider prior experience in health care quality improvement that CMS considers relevant to performing case reviews; such prior experience may include prior similar case review experience.

(c) A State government that administers a Medicaid program will be considered incapable of performing case review in an effective manner, unless the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of CMS that the State agency performing the case review will act with complete objectivity and independence from the Medicaid program.
