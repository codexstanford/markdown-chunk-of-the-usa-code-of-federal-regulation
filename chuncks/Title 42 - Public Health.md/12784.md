(1) Physician services (including consultant and referral services by a physician), which must be provided by a licensed physician, or if a service of a physician may also be provided under applicable State law by other health professionals, an HMO may provide the service through these other health professionals;

(ii) Referral services may be either for medical or for nonmedical ancillary services. Medical services must be a part of basic health services; nonmedical ancillary services (such as vocational rehabilitation and employment counseling) and prolonged rehabilitation services in a specialized inpatient or residential facility need not be a part of basic health services;

(6) Diagnostic laboratory and diagnostic and therapeutic radiologic services in support of basic health services;

(7) Home health services provided at an enrollee's home by health care personnel, as prescribed or directed by the responsible physician or other authority designated by the HMO; and

(b) In addition, an HMO may include a health service described in § 417.102 as a supplemental health service in the basic health services that it provides or arranges for its enrollees for a basic health services payment.
