###### § 84.254 Powered air-purifying respirators; requirements and tests.

(a) Except for the tests prescribed in § 84.207, the minimum requirements and performance tests for powered air-purifying respirators prescribed in subpart L of this part are applicable to vinyl chloride powered air-purifying respirators.

(b) The following bench tests are applicable to cartridges designed for use with powered air-purifying respirators for entry into and escape from vinyl chloride atmospheres containing adequate oxygen to support life:

(1) Four cartridges will be equilibrated at 25 +/-&#xB0;C by passing 85 +/-5 percent relative humidity air through them at 115 liters per minute for tight-fitting facepieces and 170 liters per minute for loose-fitting hoods and helmets, for six hours.

(2) The equilibrated cartridges will be resealed, kept in an upright position at room temperature and tested according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section within 18 hours.

(3) The cartridges equilibrated and stored as described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section will be tested on an apparatus that allows the test atmosphere at 85 +/-5 percent relative humidity and 25 +/-5 &#xB0;C to enter the cartridge continuously at a concentration of 25 ppm vinyl chloride monomer at a total flow rate of 115 liters per minute for tight-fitting facepieces and 170 liters per minute for loose-fitting hoods and helmets.

(4) The maximum allowable penetration after six hours of testing according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall not exceed 1 ppm vinyl chloride.
