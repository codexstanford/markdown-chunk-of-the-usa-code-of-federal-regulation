##### § 158.805 Mission impact reviews.

(a) The Department reviews a DHS-CS employee's mission impact throughout the employee's service in the DHS-CS and generates a mission impact summary at least annually. The Department may conduct mission impact reviews concurrently with development reviews.

(b) In reviewing a DHS-CS employee's mission impact, individually or as part of a group of DHS-CS employees, or both, the Department considers factors such as:

(1) Superior application of CTMS qualifications to perform DHS-CS cybersecurity work;

(2) Significant enhancements to CTMS qualifications;

(3) Special contributions to cybersecurity technologies, techniques, tactics, or procedures; and

(4) Notable improvements to execution of the DHS cybersecurity mission.

(c) The Department uses mission impact summary information to make distinctions among DHS-CS employees, such as comparing, categorizing, and ranking DHS-CS employees on the basis of mission impact to support decisions related to recognition for DHS-CS employees under §§ 158.630 through 158.634.
