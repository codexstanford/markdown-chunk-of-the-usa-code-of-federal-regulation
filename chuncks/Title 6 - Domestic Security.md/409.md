### PART 15 - ENFORCEMENT OF NONDISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY IN PROGRAMS OR ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
#### § 15.30 General prohibitions against discrimination.

(a) No qualified individual with a disability in the United States, shall, by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Department.

(b)(1) The Department, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of disability:

(i) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;

(ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;

(iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that provided to others;

(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits or services to individuals with a disability or to any class of individuals with a disability than is provided to others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with a disability with aid, benefits or services that are as effective as those provided to others;

(v) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or

(vi) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with a disability in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.

(2) For purposes of this part, aids, benefits, and services, to be equally effective, are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement for individuals with a disability and for nondisabled persons, but must afford individuals with a disability equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual's needs.

(3) Even if the Department is permitted, under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section, to operate a separate or different program for individuals with a disability or for any class of individuals with a disability, the Department must permit any qualified individual with a disability who wishes to participate in the program that is not separate or different to do so.

(4) The Department may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration the purpose or effect of which would:

(i) Subject qualified individuals with a disability to discrimination on the basis of disability; or

(ii) Defeat or substantially impair accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with a disability.

(5) The Department may not, in determining the site or location of a facility, make selections the purpose or effect of which would:

(i) Exclude individuals with a disability from, deny them the benefits of, or otherwise subject them to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the Department; or

(ii) Defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the objectives of a program or activity with respect to individuals with a disability.

(6) The Department, in the selection of procurement contractors, may not use criteria that subject qualified individuals with a disability to discrimination on the basis of disability.

(7) The Department may not administer a licensing or certification program in a manner that subjects qualified individuals with a disability to discrimination on the basis of disability, nor may the Department establish requirements for the programs or activities of licensees or certified entities that subject qualified individuals with a disability to discrimination on the basis of disability. However, the programs or activities of entities that are licensed or certified by the Department are not, themselves, covered by this part.

(c) The exclusion of nondisabled persons from the benefits of a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with a disability or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with a disability from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals with a disability is not prohibited by this part.

(d) The Department shall administer programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with a disability.
