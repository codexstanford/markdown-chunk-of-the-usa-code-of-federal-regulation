(2) DHS-CS cybersecurity work.

(c) The Department uses the work valuation system to establish work and career structures, such as work levels, titles, ranks, and specializations, and the Department uses these work and career structures for purposes of talent management under this part, such as:

(1) Describing and categorizing DHS-CS employees, qualified positions, and assignments;

(2) Assessing and selecting individuals for appointment to qualified positions; and

(3) Compensating DHS-CS employees under this part, including establishing and administering one or more salary structures, described in § 158.611.

(d) The Department may also use the work and career structures described in paragraph (c) of this section for budget and fiscal purposes related to administering CTMS and managing the DHS-CS.
