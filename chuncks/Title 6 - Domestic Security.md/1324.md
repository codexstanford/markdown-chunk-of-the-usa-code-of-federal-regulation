###### § 158.524 Initial service period.

(a) All individuals appointed under this part serve an initial service period that constitutes a probationary period of three years beginning on the date of appointment.

(b) Except as stated in paragraph (c) of this section, service in the DHS-CS counts toward completion of a current initial service period under paragraph (a) of this section. No other service in an appointment made outside the authority of this part may count toward completion of an initial service period under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Service as a DHS-CS advisory appointee, as a reemployed annuitant described in § 158.523(a)(1), or providing uncompensated service described in § 158.523(a)(2) does not count towards completion of an initial service period in a subsequent appointment to a qualified position.

(d) CTMS policy implementing this section addresses computation of each DHS-CS employee's initial service period, including accounting for working schedules other than full-time schedules described in § 158.705 and for periods of absence while in pay and nonpay statuses.
