#### § 13.6 Prerequisites for issuing a Complaint.

(a) The Reviewing Official may issue a Complaint under § 13.7 only if:

(1) The Department of Justice approves the issuance of a Complaint in a written Statement described in 31 U.S.C. 3803(b)(1); and

(2) In the case of allegations of liability under § 13.3(a) with respect to a Claim, the Reviewing Official determines that, with respect to such Claim or a group of related Claims submitted at the same time such Claim is submitted (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section), the amount of money or the value of property or services demanded or requested in violation of § 13.3(a) does not exceed $150,000.

(b) For the purposes of this section, a related group of Claims submitted at the same time will include only those Claims arising from the same transaction (e.g., grant, loan, application, or contract) that are submitted simultaneously as part of a single request, demand, or submission.

(c) Nothing in this section will be construed to limit the Reviewing Official's authority to join in a single Complaint against a Person's Claims that are unrelated or were not submitted simultaneously, regardless of the amount of money, or the value of property or services, demanded or requested.
