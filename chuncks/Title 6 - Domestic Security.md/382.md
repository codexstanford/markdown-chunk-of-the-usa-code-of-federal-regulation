(1) Whether the Claims or Statements identified in the Complaint, or any portions thereof, violate § 13.3;

(c) The ALJ will promptly serve the Initial Decision on all parties within 90 days after the time for submission of post-hearing briefs and reply briefs (if permitted) has expired. The ALJ will at the same time serve all parties with a Statement describing the right of any Defendant determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment to file a motion for reconsideration with the ALJ or a notice of appeal with the Authority Head. If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline contained in this paragraph, he or she will notify the parties of the reason for the delay and will set a new deadline.

(d) Unless the Initial Decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the Authority Head, or a motion for reconsideration of the Initial Decision is timely filed, the Initial Decision will constitute the final decision of the Authority Head and will be final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued by the ALJ.
