##### § 385.30 Master Implementation Sequencing Plan.

(a) Not later than December 13, 2004 the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, develop a Master Implementation Sequencing Plan that includes the sequencing and scheduling for implementation of all of the projects of the Plan, including pilot projects and operational elements, based on the best scientific, technical, funding, contracting, and other information available. The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall also consult with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force in preparing the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan.

(1) Projects shall be sequenced and scheduled to maximize the achievement of the goals and purposes of the Plan at the earliest possible time and in the most cost-effective way, consistent with the requirement that each project be justified on a next-added increment basis, including the achievement of the interim goals established pursuant to § 385.38 and the interim targets established pursuant § 385.39, consistent with § 385.36 and § 385.37(b), and to the extent practical given funding, engineering, and other constraints. The sequencing and scheduling of projects shall be based on considering factors, including, but not limited to:

(i) Technical dependencies and constraints;

(ii) Benefits to be provided by the project;

(iii) Availability of lands required for the project; and

(iv) Avoiding elimination or transfers of existing legal sources of water until an alternate source of comparable quantity and quality is available, in accordance with § 385.36.

(2) The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan shall include appropriate discussion of the logic, constraints, and other parameters used in developing the sequencing and scheduling of projects.

(3) In accordance with § 385.18, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall provide opportunities for the public to review and comment on the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan.

(b) Whenever necessary to ensure that the goals and purposes of the Plan are achieved, but at least every five years, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall, in consultation with the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal, State, and local agencies, review the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan.

(1) The Master Implementation Sequencing Plan may be revised as appropriate, consistent with the goals and purposes of the Plan, and consistent with § 385.36 and § 385.37(b), to incorporate new information including, but not limited to:

(i) Updated schedules from Project Management Plans;

(ii) Information obtained from pilot projects;

(iii) Updated funding information;

(iv) Approved revisions to the Plan;

(v) Congressional or other authorization or direction;

(vi) Information resulting from the adaptive management program, including new information on costs and benefits; or

(vii) Information regarding progress towards achieving the interim goals established pursuant to § 385.38 and the interim targets established pursuant to § 385.39.

(2) Proposed revisions to the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan shall be analyzed by RECOVER for effects on achieving the goals and purposes of the Plan and the interim goals and targets.

(3) The revised Master Implementation Sequencing Plan shall include information about the reasons for the changes to the sequencing and scheduling of individual projects.

(4) In accordance with § 385.18, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall provide opportunities for the public to review and comment on revisions to the Master Implementation Sequencing Plan.
