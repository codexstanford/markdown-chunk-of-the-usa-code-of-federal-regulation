###### Design and Construction
####### § 127.1102 Transfer hoses and loading arms.

(a) Each hose within the marine transfer area for LHG used for the transfer of LHG or its vapors to or from a vessel must-

(1) Be made of materials resistant to each LHG transferred, in both the liquid and vapor state (if wire braid is used for reinforcement, the wire must be of corrosion-resistant material, such as stainless steel);

(2) Be constructed to withstand the temperature and pressure foreseeable during transfer, with a MAWP not less than the maximum pressure to which it may be subjected and at least 1030 kPa gauge (149.4 psig);

(3) Be designed for a minimum bursting pressure of a least five times the MAWP;

(4) Have-

(i) Full-threaded connections;

(ii) Flanges that meet ASME B16.5-2020 (incorporated by reference, see § 127.003); or

(iii) Quick connect couplings that are acceptable to the Commandant;

(5) Be adequately supported against the weight of its constituent parts, the LHG, and any ice formed on it;

(6) Have no kinks, bulges, soft spots, or other defects that will let it leak or burst under normal working pressure; and

(7) Have a permanently attached nameplate that indicates, or otherwise be permanently marked to indicate-

(i) Each LHG for which it is suitable;

(ii) Its MAWP at the corresponding service temperature; and

(iii) If used for service at other than ambient temperature, its minimum service temperature.

(b) Each loading arm used for the transfer of LHG or its vapor must-

(1) Be made of materials resistant to each LHG transferred, in both the liquid and vapor state;

(2) Be constructed to withstand the temperature and pressure foreseeable during transfer;

(3) Be adequately supported against the weight of its constituent parts, the LHG, and any ice formed on it;

(4) Be provided with an alarm to indicate when it is approaching the limits of its extension, unless the examined Operations Manual requires a person to perform the same function; and

(5) Have a permanently attached nameplate that indicates, or otherwise be permanently marked to indicate-

(i) Each LHG it may handle;

(ii) Its MAWP at the corresponding service temperature; and,

(iii) If it is used for service at other than ambient temperature, its minimum service temperature.
