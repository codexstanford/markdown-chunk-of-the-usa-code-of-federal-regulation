####### § 154.2110 Vapor balancing requirements.

Paragraphs (a)(2) and (4), (b), and (c) of this section apply only to facilities transferring vapors of flammable, combustible, or non-high flash point liquid cargoes.

(a) A vapor control system (VCS) that uses a vapor balancing system in which cargo vapor is transferred from a vessel cargo tank or facility storage tank through the facility vapor collection system to a facility storage tank or vessel cargo tank must-

(1) Have facility storage tank high-level alarm systems and facility storage tank overfill control systems, independent of the high-level alarm system, arranged to prevent the cargo from entering the vapor return line;

(2) Have a detonation arrester located within the storage tank containment area and a detonation arrester located as close as practicable to the facility vapor connection. The total pipe length between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must not exceed 18 meters (59.1 feet) and the vapor piping between the detonation arrester and the facility vapor connection must be protected from any potential internal or external ignition source;

(3) Meet the overpressure and over-vacuum protection requirements of 33 CFR 154.2103; and

(4) As an alternative to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, inert cargo systems can meet the requirements of 33 CFR 2105(a)(1).

(b) A vapor balancing system, while in operation to transfer vapor to or from a vessel cargo tank and connected by way of the facility storage tank vent to a facility's main VCS with a vapor destruction unit, must have-

(1) A means to prevent backflow of vapor from the facility's main VCS to the marine vapor line; and

(2) Two fail-safe, quick-closing valves installed in the marine vapor line at the facility storage tank that automatically close when-

(i) Flame is detected on the facility storage tank; or

(ii) The temperature of the facility storage tank's vapor space reaches 177 &#xB0;C (350 &#xB0;F) or 70 percent of the vapor's auto-ignition temperature in degrees Celsius, whichever is lower.

(c) Transferring vapor from a non-inerted facility storage tank to a vessel cargo tank that is required to be inerted in accordance with 46 CFR 32.53, 153.500, or Table 151.05, is prohibited.

(d) A vapor balancing system that transfers vapor to a vessel cargo tank must not use a vapor-moving device to assist vapor transfer or inject inerting, enriching, or diluting gas into the vapor line without approval from the Commandant.
