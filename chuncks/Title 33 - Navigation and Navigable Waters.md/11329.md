(b) The security for the tolls of a vessel shall be sufficient to cover the tolls established in the "St. Lawrence Seaway Tariff of Tolls" for the gross registered tonnage of the vessel, cargo carried, and lockage tolls as well as security for any other charges estimated by the Manager.

(c)(1) Where a number of vessels:

(i) For each of which a preclearance has been given;

(ii) Are owned or controlled by the same individual or company; and
