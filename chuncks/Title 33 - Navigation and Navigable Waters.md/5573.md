###### § 157.445 Maneuvering performance capability.

(a) A tankship owner or operator shall ensure that maneuvering tests in accordance with IMO Resolution A.751(18), sections 1.2, 2.3-2.4, 3-4.2, and 5 (with Explanatory Notes in MSC/Circ.644) have been conducted by July 29, 1997. Completion of maneuvering performance tests must be shown by-

(2) For a U.S. flag tankship, results from the vessel owner confirming the completion of the tests or a letter from an authorized classification society, as described in § 157.04 of this part, stating the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section have been met.

(b) If a tankship undergoes a major conversion or alteration affecting the control systems, control surfaces, propulsion system, or other areas which may be expected to alter maneuvering performance, the tankship owner or operator shall ensure that new maneuvering tests are conducted as required by paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) If a tankship is one of a class of vessels with identical propulsion, steering, hydrodynamic, and other relevant design characteristics, maneuvering performance test results for any tankship in the class may be used to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) The tankship owner or operator shall ensure that the performance test results, recorded in the format of Appendix 6 of the Explanatory Notes in MSC/Circ.644, are prominently displayed in the wheelhouse.
