###### § 157.12f Workshop functional test requirements.

(a) Each oil content meter and each control section of a monitoring system must be subjected to a functional test on a suitable test bench prior to delivery. The detailed program for a functional test of such equipment must be developed by the manufacturer, taking into account the features and functions of the specific design of equipment. A completed workshop certificate including the delivery test protocol must be received with each unit delivered.

(b) A functional test conducted on an oil content meter must include the following operations:

(1) A check of flow rate, pressure drop, or an equivalent parameter as appropriate;

(2) A check of all alarm functions built into the meter;

(3) A check of all switching functions interconnecting with other parts of the system; and

(4) A check for correct reading at several ppm values on all measurement scales when operated on an oil appropriate for the application of the oil content meter or by an equivalent method.

(c) A functional check conducted on a control section of a monitoring system must include the following operations:

(1) A check of all alarm functions;

(2) A check of the correct function of the signal processor and the recording equipment when simulated input signals of ppm, flow rate, and speed are varied;

(3) A check that the alarm is activated when the input signals are varied to exceed the discharge limits contained in § 157.37(a)(3) and (4);

(4) A check that a signal is given to the overboard discharge control when alarm conditions are reached; and

(5) A check that the alarm is activated when each one of the input signals is varied to exceed the capacity of the system.
