(2) For a deepwater port with 31 or more persons on board:

(i) At least two lifeboats with a total capacity of 100 percent of the personnel on board;

(ii) One or more liferafts with a total capacity so that, if the survival craft at any one location are rendered unusable, there will be craft remaining with a total capacity of 100 percent of the personnel on board; and

(iii) One rescue boat.

(3) Lifeboats may be substituted for liferafts.

(4) Capacity refers to the total number of persons on the deepwater port at any one time, not including temporary personnel.

See § 149.305 of this part for additional survival craft requirements when temporary personnel are on board.
