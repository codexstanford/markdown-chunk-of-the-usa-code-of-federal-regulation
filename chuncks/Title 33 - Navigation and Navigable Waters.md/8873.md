##### § 203.86 Transfer of completed work to local interests.

Responsibility for operation and maintenance of a project for which emergency work under Public Law 84-99 is undertaken will always remain with the non-Federal sponsor throughout the process, and thereafter. The Corps will notify the non-Federal sponsor by letter when repair/rehabilitation/work efforts are completed. Detailed instructions, and suggestions relative to proper maintenance and operation, may be furnished as an enclosure to this letter. The letter will remind the local interests that they are responsible for satisfactory maintenance of the flood control works in accordance with the terms of the PCA or CA. In appropriate cases for Federal projects, refer to the "Flood Control Regulation for Maintenance and Operation of Flood Control Works: (33 CFR 208)" or the project's Operation and Maintenance Manual. Reporting requirements placed on the non-Federal sponsor will vary according to organization and other circumstances.
