(a) The obstruction lights shall be white or red lights as prescribed in Subpart 67.05 of this part and shall be of sufficient candlepower as to be visible at a distance of at least one nautical mile 90 percent of the nights of the year. The lights shall be displayed at such height, above mean high water, as shall be prescribed by the District Commander.

A copy of the specification may be obtained from the Commanding Officer, Document Automation and Production Service, 700 Robbins Avenue, Building 4, Section D, Philadelphia, PA 19111-5091.

(b) When Class "C" structures are erected in close proximity to each other, or are connected in such a manner as to prevent marine traffic from passing freely through the field, obstruction lights may be authorized to mark the perimeter structures only, when in the judgment of the District Commander the group of structures which are equipped with obstruction lights are so arranged that the particular structures are protected to the degree required by this part, and are not a hazard to navigation.

(c) Unless advised to the contrary by the District Commander, obstruction lights shall be required on Class "C" structures erected in depths of water greater than 3 feet at mean low water.
