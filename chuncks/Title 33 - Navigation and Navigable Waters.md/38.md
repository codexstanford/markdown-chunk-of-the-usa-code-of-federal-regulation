(1) The alleged violation and the applicable law or regulations;

(2) The amount of the maximum penalty that may be assessed for each violation;

(3) The general nature of the procedure for assessing and collecting the penalty;

(4) The amount of penalty that appears to be appropriate, based on the material then available to the Hearing Officer;

(5) The right to examine all materials in the case file and have a copy of all written documents provided upon request; and,

(6) The fact that the party may demand a hearing prior to any actual assessment of a penalty.
