(a) Parties engaged in the transportation of loose logs, timbers, and rafts of logs, poles, posts, ties, or pulpwood, on the waters described in this section, shall conduct their operations so as to interfere as little as possible with navigation by steamboats, launches, or other craft, or with the operations of other parties using the waters for purposes similar to their own, and, so far as may be possible, shall prevent the formation of log jams.

(b) In case of the formation of a jam, the owner of the logs, poles, posts, ties, or pulpwood, causing the jam, or the representatives in charge of the drive or tow, shall cause the same to be broken with the least practicable delay.

(c) Steamboats, launches, or other craft desiring to pass through a body of floating logs, poles, or ties shall be given all reasonable and necessary assistance in doing so by the representatives in charge of the logs, poles, posts, ties, or pulpwood causing the obstruction.

(d) Any individual, firm, or corporation banking logs, poles, posts, ties, or pulpwood on the shores or within the banks of any of the waters covered by this section, which are to be transported during the navigation season, shall so place them as to maintain a clear navigable channel width of not less than 20 feet.

(e) Parties using the river for rafted poles, posts, ties, or pulpwood shall not tie rafts up to the bank two or more abreast; shall not tie up where there will be less than 50 feet of clear waterway between their raft and the other bank or between their raft and another tied to the opposite bank; and shall not tie more than three rafts along any bank without leaving an opening for a landing.
