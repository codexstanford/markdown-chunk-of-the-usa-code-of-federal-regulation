###### § 150.405 How must a cargo transfer system be tested and inspected?

(a) No person may transfer oil or natural gas through a cargo transfer system (CTS) at a deepwater port unless it has been inspected and tested according to this section.

(b) The single point mooring (SPM)-CTS must be maintained as required by the design standards used to comply with § 149.650 of this chapter.

(c) If the manufacturer's maximum pressure rating for any cargo transfer hose in a SPM-CTS has been exceeded, unless it was exceeded for testing required by this section, the hose must be:

(1) Removed;

(2) Hydrostatically tested to 1.5 times its maximum working pressure for oil, or 1.1 times its maximum working pressure for natural gas; and

(3) Visually examined externally and internally for evidence of:

(i) Leakage;

(ii) Loose covers;

(iii) Kinks;

(iv) Bulges;

(v) Soft spots; and

(vi) Gouges, cuts, or slashes that penetrate the hose reinforcement.

(d) Each submarine hose used in cargo transfer operations in an SPM-CTS must have been removed from its coupling, surfaced, and examined as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, within the preceding 2 years for oil, or 15 months for natural gas; and

(e) Before resuming cargo transfer operations, each submarine hose in an SPM-CTS must be visually examined in place as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section after cargo transfer operations are shut down due to sea conditions at the deepwater port.
