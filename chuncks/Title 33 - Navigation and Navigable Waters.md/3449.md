###### § 136.207 Authorized claimants.

(a) Claims for uncompensated natural resource damages may be presented by an appropriate natural resources trustee. However, in order to facilitate the processing of these claims with respect to a single incident where multiple trustees are involved and to prevent double recovery, the affected trustees should select a lead administrative trustee who will present consolidated claims on behalf of the trustees.

(b) A trustee may present a claim for the reasonable cost of assessing natural resources damages separately from a claim for the cost of developing and implementing plans for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the equivalent of the natural resources damaged.
