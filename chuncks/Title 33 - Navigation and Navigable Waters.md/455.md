The Superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy tenders appointments on the basis of previous academic performance, reported College Entrance Examination Board or American College Testing scores, and the findings of a Cadet Candidate Evaluation Board, consisting of Coast Guard officers appointed by the Superintendent of the Coast Guard Academy, which reviews each applicant's personal qualifications. In addition, a Service Academy Medical Examination must be satisfactorily completed before appointment. Applications must be submitted online atusing Coast Guard forms CGA-14, CGA-14A, CGA-14B, CGA-14C, and CGA-14D. These forms, along with additional information on the Cadet appointment program, may be obtained from the Director of Admissions, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, New London, CT 06320.
