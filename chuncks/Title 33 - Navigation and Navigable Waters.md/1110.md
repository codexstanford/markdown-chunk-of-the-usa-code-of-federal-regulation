###### § 97.210 Appeals.

(a) A vessel owner or operator, or person acting on their behalf, who disagrees with a decision of a CSM approval authority may submit a written appeal to the approval authority requesting reconsideration of information in dispute. Within 30 days of receiving the appeal, the approval authority must provide the submitter with a final written ruling on the request, with a copy to the Commandant.

(b) A submitter who is dissatisfied with the approval authority's final written ruling may appeal directly to the Commandant. The appeal must be made in writing and include the documentation and supporting evidence the submitter wants to be considered, and may ask the Commandant to stay the effect of the appealed decision while it is under review by the Commandant.

(c) The Commandant will make a decision on the appeal and send a formal response to the submitter and a copy to the approval authority. The Commandant's decision will constitute final agency action on the appeal request.
