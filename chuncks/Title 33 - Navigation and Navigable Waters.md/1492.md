(2) The VSP submitted for approval and a current acknowledgement letter from the Commanding Officer, MSC, stating that the Coast Guard is currently reviewing the VSP submitted for approval, and that the vessel may continue to operate so long as the vessel remains in compliance with the submitted plan;

(3) For vessels operating under a Coast Guard-approved Alternative Security Program as provided in § 104.140, a copy of the Alternative Security Program the vessel is using, including a vessel specific security assessment report generated under the Alternative Security Program, as specified in § 101.120(b)(3) of this subchapter, and a letter signed by the vessel owner or operator, stating which Alternative Security Program the vessel is using and certifying that the vessel is in full compliance with that program; or

(4) For foreign vessels, subject to the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, (SOLAS), Chapter XI-1 or Chapter XI-2, a valid International Ship Security Certificate (ISSC) that attests to the vessel's compliance with SOLAS Chapter XI-2 and the ISPS Code, part A (Incorporated by reference, see § 101.115 of this subchapter) and is issued in accordance with the ISPS Code, part A, section 19. As stated in Section 9.4 of the ISPS Code, part A requires that, in order for the ISSC to be issued, the provisions of part B of the ISPS Code need to be taken into account.

(b) Each owner or operator of an unmanned vessel subject to this part must maintain the documentation described in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. The letter required by each of those paragraphs must be carried on board the vessel. The plan or program required by each of those paragraphs must not be carried on board the vessel, but must be maintained in a secure location. During scheduled inspections, the plan or program must be made available to the Coast Guard upon request.

(c) Each vessel owner or operator who designates a passenger or employee access area (as those terms are defined in §§ 104.106 and 104.107 of this part) on their vessel must keep on board the vessel with their approved VSP a clear, visual representation (such as a vessel schematic) of where those designated areas fall. This need not be submitted to the Coast Guard for approval until incorporated into the VSP at the next VSP submittal (either renewal or amendment), but must be made available to the Coast Guard upon request.
