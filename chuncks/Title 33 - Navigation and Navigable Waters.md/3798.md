(b) An EEP must be submitted by-

(1) The holder of a lease or permit under the Act for each MODU within the area of the lease or the area covered by the permit; or

(2) The operator under 30 CFR 250.2(gg), if other than the holder of a lease or permit, for each MODU within the area in which the operator controls or manages operations.

(d) In complying with § 146.140(d)(7), the EEP must designate the master or person in charge of the MODU under 46 CFR 109.107 as the individual who is assigned primary responsibility for implementing the EEP, as it relates to that MODU.
