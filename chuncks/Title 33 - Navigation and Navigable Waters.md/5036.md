(a) A tank vessel with a capacity of 250 or more barrels that is carrying oil or hazardous material as cargo must have on board an emergency means to enable the person in charge of a transfer operation to a facility, to another vessel, or within the vessel to stop the flow of oil or hazardous material.

(b) The means to stop the flow may be a pump control, a quick-acting, power actuated valve, or an operating procedure. If an emergency pump control is used, it must stop the flow of oil or hazardous material if the oil or hazardous material could siphon through the stopped pump.

(c) The means to stop the flow must be operable from the cargo deck, cargo control room, or the usual operating station of the person in charge of the transfer operation.
