(b) When notified of an increase in the MARSEC Level, the vessel owner or operator must ensure:

(2) The COTP is notified as required by § 101.300(c) when compliance with the higher MARSEC Level has been implemented;

(3) For vessels in port, that compliance with the higher MARSEC Level has taken place within 12 hours of the notification; and

(4) If a higher MARSEC Level is set for the OCS facility with which the vessel is interfacing or is about to visit, the vessel complies, without undue delay, with all measures specified in the VSP for compliance with that higher MARSEC Level.

(c) For MARSEC Levels 2 and 3, the Vessel Security Officer must brief all vessel personnel of identified threats, emphasize reporting procedures, and stress the need for increased vigilance.
