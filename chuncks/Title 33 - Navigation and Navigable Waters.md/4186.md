In addition to obstruction lights, the tallest platform of a deepwater port must have a lit rotating beacon that distinguishes the deepwater port from other surrounding offshore structures. The beacon must:

(a) Have an effective intensity of at least 15,000 candela;

(b) Flash at least once every 20 seconds;

(c) Provide a white light signal;

(d) Operate in wind speeds of up to 100 knots at a rotation rate that is within 6 percent of the operating speed displayed on the beacon;

(e) Have one or more leveling indicators permanently attached to the light, each with an accuracy of +/-0.25 &#xB0; or better; and

(f) Be located:

(1) At least 60 feet (about 18.3 meters) above mean high water;

(2) Where the structure of the platform, or equipment mounted on the platform, does not obstruct the light in any direction; and

(3) So that it is visible all around the horizon.
