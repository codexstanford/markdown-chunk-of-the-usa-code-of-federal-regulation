### PART 209 - ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE
#### § 209.315 Public access to navigation works.

While the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the army for various navigation improvements usually strictly prohibit trespass on Government property, those regulations will not be construed as prohibiting access to navigation works of general public interest subject to the following criteria:

(a) The public will not be permitted in areas where their presence would subject themselves or Government operating personnel to serious accident hazards.

(b) The public will not be permitted in areas where their presence would interfere with any phases of navigation operations.

(c) The public will be given access to all areas other than those specified under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, subject only to the normal legal requirements with respect to property and personal rights.
