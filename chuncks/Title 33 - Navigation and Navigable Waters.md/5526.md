(a) The master of a tank vessel having a COW system under § 157.10(e), § 157.10a(a)(2), or 157.10c(b)(2) shall ensure that-

(1) Before crude oil washing a cargo tank, the level in each tank with crude oil that is used as a source for crude oil washing is lowered at least one meter;

(2) A tank used as a slop tank is not used as a source for crude oil washing until:

(i) Its contents are discharged ashore or to another tank; and

(ii) The tank contains only crude oil;

(3) During COW operations:

(i) The valves under § 157.122(i)(1) are shut; or

(ii) The blanks under § 157.122(i)(2) are installed;

(4) The rotation of each COW machine mounted to or close to the bottom of each cargo tank is verified by:

(i) A visual inspection of a means located outside of the cargo tank that indicates movement of the machine during COW operations;

(ii) An audio inspection during COW operations; or

(iii) An inspection on a ballast voyage, with water as the fluid flowing through the machine;

(5) During the audio inspection under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, the COW machine being inspected is the only one operating in that tank;

(6) Before the inspection under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, the tank that has the COW machine being inspected in it, is gas freed;

(13) The fire main is not connected to the COW system; and

(14) On combination carriers, if flexible hoses under § 157.122(o) are used, those hoses are protectively stowed when not installed in the COW piping system.

(b) In addition to meeting paragraph (a) of this section, the master of a tank vessel having a COW system under § 157.10a(a)(2) or § 157.10c(b)(2) shall ensure that-

(1) Before ballasting cargo tanks upon leaving a port, each cargo pump, manifold, and piping that is used for ballasting the cargo tanks is drained of all crude oil; and

(2) Before ballasting or deballasting cargo tanks, except when ballasting cargo tanks to leave a port, the cargo piping that is used for ballasting or deballasting the cargo tanks is water washed.
