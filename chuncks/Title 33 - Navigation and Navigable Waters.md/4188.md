(2) Visible all around the horizon;

(3) Visible for at least 2 miles (3.7 km) on a clear, dark night;

(4) Not less than 1 or more than 3.5 meters (3 to 11.5 feet) above the water;

(5) Approximately equally spaced;

(6) Not more than 10 meters (32.8 feet) apart where the hose string crosses a navigable channel; and

(7) Where the hose string does not cross a navigable channel, there must be a sufficient number to clearly show the hose string's length and course.

(b) Two red lights at each end of the hose string, including the ends in a channel where the hose string is separated to allow vessels to pass, whether open or closed. The lights must be:

(1) Visible all around the horizon;
