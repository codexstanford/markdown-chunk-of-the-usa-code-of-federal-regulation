###### § 155.790 Deck lighting.

(a) A self-propelled vessel with a capacity of 250 or more barrels of oil or hazardous material that is conducting transfer operations between sunset and sunrise must have deck lighting that adequately illuminates-

(1) Each transfer operations work area and each transfer connection point in use on the vessel; and

(2) Each transfer operations work area and each transfer connection point in use on each barge, if any, moored to the vessel to or from which oil or hazardous material is being transferred;

(b) Where the illumination is apparently inadequate the OCMI or COTP may require verification by instrument of the levels of illumination. On a horizontal plane 3 feet above the deck the illumination must measure at least:

(1) 5.0 foot candles at transfer connection points; and

(2) 1.0 foot candle in transfer operations work areas.

(c) Lighting must be located or shielded so as not to mislead or otherwise interfere with navigation on the adjacent waterways.
