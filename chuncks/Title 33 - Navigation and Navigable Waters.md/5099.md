(b) Vessels subject to this subpart may not transfer oil in a port or place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, where the oil to be transferred was received from another vessel subject to this subpart during a lightering operation referred to in § 155.1015(b), unless both vessels engaged in the lightering operation were operating at the time in compliance with a plan approved under § 155.1065.

(c)(1) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a vessel may continue to handle, store, transport, transfer, or lighter oil for 2 years after the date of submission of a response plan pending approval of that plan, if the vessel owner or operator has received written authorization for continued operations from the Coast Guard.

(2) To receive this authorization, the vessel owner or operator must certify in writing to the Coast Guard that the owner or operator has identified and ensured the availability of, through contract or other approved means, the necessary private response resources to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge or substantial threat of such a discharge from their vessel as described in § 155.1050, § 155.1052, § 155.1230, or § 155.2230, as appropriate.

To be authorized, the vessel owner or operator shall certify to the COTP in writing, prior to the vessel's entry into the COTP zone, that-

(2) The approved response plan or the required plan section(s) is aboard the vessel;

(3) The vessel owner or operator has identified and informed the vessel master and the COTP of the designated qualified individual prior to the vessel's entry into the COTP zone; and
