(a) The ALJ may order the taking of the testimony of a witness by telephonic conference call. A person presenting evidence may by motion ask for the taking of testimony by this means. The arrangement of the call must let each participant listen to and speak to each other within the hearing of the ALJ, who will ensure the full identification of each so the reporter can create a proper record.

(b) The ALJ may issue a subpoena directing a witness to testify by telephonic conference call. The subpoena in any such instance issues under the procedures in § 20.608.
