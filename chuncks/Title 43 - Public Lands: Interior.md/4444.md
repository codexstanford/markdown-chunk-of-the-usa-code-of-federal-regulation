(a) If an error is found, the BLM will send you a notice identifying any correctable errors or omissions and whether the error is substantive or technical.

(1) You will have 60 days from the date you received the notice to correct the errors or provide the omitted materials.

(2) If you do not submit the corrections to the BLM within the 60-day period, the BLM will issue a decision rejecting your application and require you to submit a new application.

(b) If the error is a substantive error, your application will not be deemed received until the corrections are made.

(c) If the error is a technical error, your application will be deemed received as of the receipt date. However, the application may still be rejected if the BLM does not receive the corrections within 60 days from the date you received the notice to correct the errors.

(d) If you have uncorrectable defect, then the BLM will issue a decision rejecting your application.
