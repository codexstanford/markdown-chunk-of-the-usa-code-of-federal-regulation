####### § 3275.15 How accurately must I measure my production and utilization?

It depends on whether you use a meter to calculate Federal production or royalty, and what quantity of resource you are measuring.

(a) For meters that you use to calculate Federal royalty:

(1) If the meter measures electricity, it must have an accuracy of +/-0.25% or better of reading;

(2) If the meter measures steam flowing at more than 100,000 lbs/hr on a monthly basis, it must have an accuracy reading of +/-2 percent or better;

(3) If the meter measures steam flowing at less than 100,000 lbs/hr on a monthly basis, it must have an accuracy reading of +/-4 percent or better;

(4) If the meter measures water flowing at more than 500,000 lbs/hr on a monthly basis, it must have an accuracy reading of +/-2 percent or better;

(5) If the meter measures water flowing at 500,000 lbs/hr or less on a monthly basis, it must have an accuracy reading of +/-4 percent or better;

(6) If the meter measures heat content, it must have an accuracy reading of +/-4 percent, or better; or

(7) If the meter measures two-phase flow at any rate, BLM will determine and inform you of the meter accuracy requirements. You must obtain our prior written approval before installing and using meters for two-phase flow.

(b) Any meters that you do not use to calculate Federal royalty are considered production meters, which must maintain an accuracy of +/-5 percent or better.

(c) We may modify these requirements as necessary to protect the interests of the United States.
