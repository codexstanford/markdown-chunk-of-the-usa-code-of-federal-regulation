(b) A general description of geologic conditions and mineral resources within the area where mining is to be conducted, including appropriate maps;

(c) A copy of a suitable map or aerial photograph showing the topography, the area covered by each lease, the name and location of major topographic and cultural features;

(d) A statement of proposed methods of operation and development, including the following items as appropriate:

(1) A description detailing the extraction technology to be used;

(2) The equipment to be used in development and extraction;

(3) The proposed access roads;

(4) The size, location, and schematics of all structures, facilities, and lined or unlined pits to be built;

(5) The stripping ratios, development sequence, and schedule;

(6) The number of acres in the Federal lease(s) or license(s) to be affected;

(7) Comprehensive well design and procedure for drilling, casing, cementing, testing, stimulation, clean-up, completion, and production, for all drilled well types, including those used for heating, freezing, and disposal;

(8) A description of the methods and means to protect and monitor all aquifers;

(9) Surveyed well location plats or project-wide well location plats;

(10) A description of the measurement and handling of produced fluids, including the anticipated production rates and estimated recovery factors;

(11) A description of the methods used to dispose of and control mining waste; and

(12) A description/discussion of the controls that the operator will use to protect the public, including identification of:

(i) Essential operations, personnel, and health and safety precautions;

(ii) Programs and plans for noxious gas control (hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, etc.);

(iii) Well control procedures;

(iv) Temporary abandonment procedures; and

(v) Plans to address spills, leaks, venting, and flaring;

(e) An estimate of the quantity and quality of the oil shale resources;

(f) An explanation of how MER of the resource will be achieved for each Federal lease;

(g) Appropriate maps and cross sections showing:

(1) Federal lease boundaries and serial numbers;

(2) Surface ownership and boundaries;

(3) Locations of any existing and abandoned mines and existing oil and gas well (including well bore trajectories) and water well locations, including well bore trajectories;

(4) Typical geological structure cross sections;

(5) Location of shafts or mining entries, strip pits, waste dumps, retort facilities, and surface facilities;

(6) Typical mining or in situ development sequence, with appropriate time-frames;

(h) A narrative addressing the environmental aspects of the proposed mine or in situ operation, including at a minimum, the following:

(1) An estimate of the quantity of water to be used and pollutants that may enter any receiving waters;

(2) A design for the necessary impoundment, treatment, control, or injection of all produced water, runoff water, and drainage from workings; and

(3) A description of measures to be taken to prevent or control fire, soil erosion, subsidence, pollution of surface and ground water, pollution of air, damage to fish or wildlife or other natural resources, and hazards to public health and safety;

(i) A reclamation plan and schedule for all Federal lease(s) or exploration license(s) that details all reclamation activities necessary to fulfill the requirements of § 3931.20;

(j) The method of abandonment of operations on Federal lease(s) and exploration license(s) proposed to protect the unmined recoverable reserves and other resources, including:

(1) The method proposed to fill in, fence, or close all surface openings that are hazardous to people or animals; and

(2) For in situ operations, a description of the method and materials to be used to plug all abandoned development or production wells; and

(k) Any additional information that the BLM determines is necessary for analysis or approval of the POD.
