(a) The Act of June 5, 1920 (41 Stat. 1059; 48 U.S.C. 372) provides that the Secretary of the Interior in his discretion, may upon application to enter or otherwise, waive the restriction that no entry shall be allowed extending more than 160 rods along the shore of any navigable waters as to such lands as he shall determine are not necessary for harborage, landing, and wharf purposes. The act does not authorize the waiver of the 80-rod restriction, mentioned in § 2094.0-3.

(b) Except as to trade and manufacturing sites, and home and headquarters sites, any applications to enter and notices of settlement which cover lands extending more than 160 rods along the shore of any navigable water will be considered as a petition for waiver of the 160-rod limitation mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section, provided that it is accompanied by a showing that the lands are not necessary for harborage, landing and wharf purposes and that the public interests will not be injured by waiver of the limitation.
