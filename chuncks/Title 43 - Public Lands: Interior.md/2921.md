##### § 49.525 How will the Federal land manager calculate the amount of a proposed and final assessment of civil penalty?

(a) The Federal land manager will determine the amount of the civil penalty by taking into account:

(1) The scientific or commercial value, whichever is greater as determined by the Federal land manager, of the paleontological resource involved;

(2) The cost of response, restoration, and repair of the paleontological resource and the paleontological site involved;

(3) Other factors that the Federal land manager considers relevant, such as prior violations or warnings or evidence of malicious intent;

(4) Information provided under § 49.515 or furnished to the Federal land manager upon his or her request; and

(5) Mitigating factors, which may include return of paleontological resources and whether the person will provide information that may assist the bureau.

(b) Scientific value, commercial value, and the cost of response, restoration, and repair of the paleontological resource and the paleontological site are determined in accordance with subpart G of this part.

(c) In the case of any subsequent violation by the same person, the Federal land manager may calculate a penalty in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and double it for that subsequent violation.

(d) The maximum penalty assessed under paragraph (c) of this section for any one violation may not exceed the sum of:

(1) Two times the cost of response, restoration, and repair of paleontological resources and paleontological site damage; plus

(2) Two times the scientific or commercial value, whichever is greater as determined by the Federal land manager, of the paleontological resources and paleontological sites destroyed or not salvaged.

(e) The final assessment of civil penalty may be equal to, less than, or more than the proposed civil penalty.
