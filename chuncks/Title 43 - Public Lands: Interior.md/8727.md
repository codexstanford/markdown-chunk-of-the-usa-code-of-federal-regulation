BLM will provide notice, approved by the BLM Director, to the public of any hearing concerning sustained-yield forest units. This notice must be published once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the forest units are situated. BLM may also publish the notice in a trade publication; and

(b) Forward the minutes or meeting records to the BLM Director, along with an appropriate recommendation concerning the establishment of the units.
