####### § 3135.2 Under what circumstances will BLM require a suspension of operations and production or approve my request for a suspension of operations and production for my lease?

(a) BLM will require a suspension of operations and production or approve your request for a suspension of operations and production for your lease(s) if BLM determines that-

(1) It is in the interest of conservation of natural resources;

(2) It encourages the greatest ultimate recovery of oil and gas, such as by encouraging the planning and construction of a transportation system to a new area of discovery; or

(3) It mitigates reasonably foreseeable and significantly adverse effects on surface resources.

(b) BLM will suspend operations and production for your lease if it determines that, despite the exercise of due care and diligence, you can't comply with your lease requirements for reasons beyond your control.

(c) If BLM requires a suspension of operations and production or approves your request for a suspension of operations and production, the suspension-

(1) Stops the running of your lease term and prevents it from expiring for as long as the suspension is in effect;

(2) Relieves you of your obligation to pay rent, royalty, or minimum royalty during the suspension; and

(3) Prohibits you from operating on, producing from, or having any other beneficial use of your lease during the suspension. However, you must continue to perform necessary maintenance and safety activities.
