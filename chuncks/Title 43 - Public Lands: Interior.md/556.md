###### § 4.828 Use of depositions at hearing.

(a) Any part or all of a deposition so far as admissible under § 4.835 applied as though the witness were then present and testifying, may be used against any party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice thereof as follows:

(1) Any deposition may be used for contradiction or impeachment of the deponent as a witness.

(2) The deposition of a party, or of an agent designated to testify on behalf of a party, may be used by an adverse party for any purpose.

(3) The deposition of any witness may be used for any purpose if the party offering the deposition has been unable to procure the attendance of the witness because he is dead; or if the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles from the place of hearing, or is out of the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or if the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or, upon application and notice, that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open hearing, to allow the deposition to be used.

(b) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence, the remainder becomes subject to introduction by any party.

(c) Objection may be made at the hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and testifying.
