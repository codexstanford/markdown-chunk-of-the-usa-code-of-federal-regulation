###### § 404.38 Are there different requirements for determining the appropriate non-Federal share of construction costs to be paid by Indian tribes?

Yes. The appropriate non-Federal share of construction costs to be paid by Indian tribes will be based on:

(a) Consideration of an Indian tribe's capability to pay at least 25 percent of the construction costs, to be determined in accordance with the factors in § 404.39; and

(b) If Reclamation determines, based on the analysis in § 404.38(a), that an Indian tribe is not capable of paying at least 25 percent of the construction costs, Reclamation may recommend in its feasibility report that the collection of all or part of the non-Federal construction costs apportioned to an Indian tribe be deferred, unless or until Reclamation determines that the Indian tribe should pay all or a portion of those costs.
