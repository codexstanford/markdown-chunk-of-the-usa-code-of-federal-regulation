##### § 2.67 When will the Department make records available without a FOIA request?

(a) Each bureau must:

(1) Determine which of its records must be made publicly available under the FOIA (for example, certain frequently requested records);

(2) Identify additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure; and

(3) Post those records in FOIA libraries.

(b) Because of these proactive disclosures, you are encouraged to review the Department's FOIA libraries before filing a FOIA request. The material you seek may be immediately available electronically at no cost.
