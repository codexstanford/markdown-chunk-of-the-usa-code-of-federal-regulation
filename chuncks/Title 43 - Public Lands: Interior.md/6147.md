####### § 3174.14 Determination of oil volumes by methods other than measurement.

(a) Under 43 CFR 3162.7-2, when production cannot be measured due to spillage or leakage, the amount of production must be determined by using any method the AO approves or prescribes. This category of production includes, but is not limited to, oil that is classified as slop oil or waste oil.

(b) No oil may be classified or disposed of as waste oil unless the operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the AO that it is not economically feasible to put the oil into marketable condition.

(c) The operator may not sell or otherwise dispose of slop oil without prior written approval from the AO. Following the sale or disposal of slop oil, the operator must notify the AO in writing of the volume sold or disposed of and the method used to compute the volume.
