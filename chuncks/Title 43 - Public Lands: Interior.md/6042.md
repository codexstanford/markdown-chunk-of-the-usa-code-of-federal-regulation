####### § 3173.23 Applying for off-lease measurement.

To apply for approval of off-lease measurement, the operator must submit the following to the BLM office having jurisdiction over the leases, units, or communitized areas:

(a) A completed Sundry Notice;

(b) Justification for off-lease measurement (considering factors such as BMPs, topographic and environmental issues, and maximum ultimate economic recovery);

(c) A topographic map or maps of appropriate scale showing the following:

(1) The boundary of the lease, unit, unit PA, or communitized area from which the production originates; and

(2) The location of existing or planned facilities and the relative location of all wellheads (including the API number for each well) and piping included in the off-lease measurement proposal, and existing FMPs or FMPs proposed to be installed to the extent known or anticipated;

(d) The surface ownership of all land on which equipment is, or is proposed to be, located;

(e) If any of the proposed off-lease measurement facilities are located on non-federally owned surface, a written concurrence signed by the owner(s) of the surface and the owner(s) of the measurement facilities, including each owner's name, address, and telephone number, granting the BLM unrestricted access to the off-lease measurement facility and the surface on which it is located, for the purpose of inspecting any production, measurement, water handling, or transportation equipment located on the non-Federal surface up to and including the FMP, and for otherwise verifying production accountability. If the ownership of the non-Federal surface or of the measurement facility changes, the operator must obtain and provide to the AO the written concurrence required under this paragraph from the new owner(s) within 30 days of the change in ownership;

(f) A right-of-way grant application (Standard Form 299), filed under 43 CFR part 2880, if the proposed off-lease FMP is on a pipeline, or under 43 CFR part 2800, if the proposed off-lease FMP is a meter or storage tank. This requirement applies only when new surface disturbance is proposed for the FMP and its associated facilities are located on BLM-managed land;

(g) A right-of-way grant application, filed under 25 CFR part 169 with the appropriate BIA office, if any of the proposed surface facilities are on Indian land outside the lease, unit, or communitized area from which the production originated;

(h) Written approval from the appropriate surface-management agency, if new surface disturbance is proposed for the FMP and its associated facilities are located on Federal land managed by an agency other than the BLM;

(i) An application for approval of off-lease royalty-free use (if required under applicable rules), if the operator proposes to use production from the lease, unit, or CA as fuel at the off-lease measurement facility without payment of royalty;

(j) A statement that indicates whether the proposal includes all, or only a portion of, the production from the lease, unit, or CA. (For example, gas, but not oil, could be proposed for off-lease measurement.) If the proposal includes only a portion of the production, identify the FMP(s) where the remainder of the production from the lease, unit, or CA is measured or is proposed to be measured; and

(k) If the operator is applying for an amendment of an existing approval of off-lease measurement, the operator must submit a completed Sundry Notice required under paragraph (a) of this section, and information required under paragraphs (b) through (j) of this section to the extent the information previously submitted has changed.
