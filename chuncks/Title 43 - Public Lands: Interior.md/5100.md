Where, in the judgment of the authorized officer, it appears necessary in order to carry out the policy set forth in § 2812.0-6, he may require the applicant, as a condition precedent to the issuance of the permit:

(a) To grant to the United States, for use by it and its licensees and permittees, rights-of-way across lands in the O. and C. area directly controlled by the applicant; and as to lands in such area which are indirectly controlled by him, either to obtain such rights for the United States or to make a showing satisfactory to the authorized officer that he has negotiated therefor in good faith and to waive as to the United States, its licensees and permittees any exclusive or restricted right he may have to such lands as are indirectly controlled by him.

(b) In addition, to agree to permit the United States and its licensees, upon the payment of fair compensation as hereinafter provided, to use under the terms and conditions of this paragraph such portion as the applicant directly controls of the road system and rights-of-way which are an integral part of or may be added to the road system with which the right-of-way applied for will connect, and as to the portions of such road system or rights-of-way as the applicant indirectly controls, either to obtain such rights for the United States and its licensees or to make a showing satisfactory to the authorized officer that he has negotiated therefor in good faith and, in such latter circumstance, to waive as to the United States and its licensees any exclusive or restricted right he may have in such portion of the road system and rights-of-way.
