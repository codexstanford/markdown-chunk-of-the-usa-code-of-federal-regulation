######## § 3809.590 When will BLM release or reduce the financial guarantee for my notice or plan of operations?

(a) When you (the mining claimant or operator) have completed all or any portion of the reclamation of your operations in accordance with your notice or approved plan of operations, you may notify BLM that the reclamation has occurred and request a reduction in the financial guarantee or BLM approval of the adequacy of the reclamation, or both.

(b) BLM will then promptly inspect the reclaimed area. We encourage you to accompany the BLM inspector.

(c) For your plan of operations, BLM will either post in the local BLM office or publish notice of final financial guarantee release in a local newspaper of general circulation and accept comments for 30 calendar days. Subsequently, BLM will notify you, in writing, whether you may reduce the financial guarantee under § 3809.591, or the reclamation is acceptable, or both.
