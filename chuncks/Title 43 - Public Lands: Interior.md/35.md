##### § 2.23 When will the bureau deny a request or procedural benefits?

(a) A bureau denies a request when it makes a decision that:

(1) A requested record is exempt, in full or in part;

(2) The request does not reasonably describe the records sought;

(3) A requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or is not in the bureau's possession and/or control; or

(4) A requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format you seek.

(b) A bureau denies a procedural benefit only, and not access to the underlying records, when it makes a decision that:

(1) A fee waiver, or another fee-related issue, will not be granted; or

(2) Expedited processing will not be provided.

(c) The bureau must consult with the Office of the Solicitor before it denies a fee waiver request or withholds all or part of a requested record (unless the Office of the Solicitor has expressly preapproved such a withholding).
