####### § 2812.4-1 Agreements and arbitration between permittee and licensee respecting compensation payable by licensee to permittee for use of road.

(a) In the event the United States exercises the rights received from a permittee hereunder to license a person to remove forest products over any road, right-of-way, or lands of the permittee or of his successor in interest, to the extent that such matters are not covered by an agreement under § 2812.3-7 of this subpart, such licensee will be required to pay the permittee or his successor in interest such compensation and to furnish him such security, and to carry such liability insurance as the permittee or his successor in interest and the licensee may agree upon. If the parties do not agree, then upon the written request of either party delivered to the other party, the matter shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the procedures established by § 2812.4-4. During the pendency of such arbitration proceedings the licensee shall be entitled to use the road, right-of-way, or lands involved upon payment, or tender thereof validly maintained, to the permittee of an amount to be determined by the authorized officer and upon the furnishing to the permittee of a corporate surety bond in an amount equal to the difference between the amount fixed by the authorized officer and the amount sought by the permittee. The licensee shall also, as a condition of use in such circumstances, maintain such liability insurance in such amounts covering any additional hazard and risk which might accrue by reason of the licensee's use of the road, as the authorized officer may prescribe.

(b) The arbitrators shall base their award as to the compensation to be paid by the licensee to the permittee or his successor in interest upon the amortization of the replacement costs for a road of the type involved, including in such replacement costs an extraordinary cost peculiar to the construction of the particular road involved and subtracting therefrom any capital investment made by the United States or its licensees in the particular road involved or in improvements thereto used by and useful to the permittee or his successor in interest plus a reasonable interest allowance on the resulting cost figure, taking into account the risk involved, plus costs of maintenance if furnished by the permittee or his successor, including costs of gates and gateman. In arriving at the amortization item, the arbitrators shall take into account the probable period of time, past and present, during which such road may be in existence, and the volume of timber which has been moved and the volume of timber currently merchantable, which probably will be moved from all sources over such road. The arbitrators shall also take into account the extent to which the use which the licensee might otherwise economically make of the road system is limited by § 2812.3-5. In addition, the arbitrators may fix the rate at which payments shall be made by the licensee during his use of the road. The arbitrators shall require the licensee to provide adequate bond, cash deposit, or other security to indemnify the permittee or his successor in interest against failure of the licensee to comply with the terms of the award and against damage to the road not incident to normal usage and for any other reasonable purpose, and also to carry appropriate liability insurance covering any additional hazard and risks which may accrue by reason of the licensee's use of the road.

(c) Where improvements or additions are required to enable a licensee to use a road or right-of-way to remove timber or forest products, the cost of such improvements will be allowable to the licensee.

(d) The full value at current stumpage prices will be allocable against a licensee for all timber to be cut, removed, or destroyed by the licensee on a permittee's land in the construction or improvement of the road involved.
