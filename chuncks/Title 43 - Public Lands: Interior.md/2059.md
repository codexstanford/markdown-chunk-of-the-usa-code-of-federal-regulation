(2) The parties must offer evidence sufficient to satisfy the judge of the percentage of ownership held and offered by a party.

(3) If the decedent's devisees or eligible heirs enter into an agreement, the parties to the agreement are not required to comply with the Secretary's rules and requirements otherwise applicable to conveyances by deed.

(2) All parties to the agreement know the material facts;

(3) All parties to the agreement understand the effect of the agreement on their rights; and

(4) The agreement accomplishes consolidation.

(d) An interest included in an approved agreement may not be purchased at probate without consent of the owner of the consolidated interest.
