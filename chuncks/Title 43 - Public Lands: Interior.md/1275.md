##### § 11.36 May the authorized official use both type A and type B procedures for the same release?

(a) The authorized official may use both a type A procedure and type B procedures for the same release if:

(1) The type B procedures are cost-effective and can be performed at a reasonable cost;

(2) There is no double recovery; and

(3) The type B procedures are used only to determine damages for injuries or compensable values that do not fall into the categories addressed by the type A procedure. [Sections 11.14(v) and 11.62 define "injury." Section 11.83(c)(1) defines "compensable value."]

(b) The type A procedures address the following categories of injury and compensable value:

(1) Direct mortality of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from short-term exposure to the released substance. Volume IV of the NRDAM/CME technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) lists the species that the NRDAM/CME covers. Section 3, Volume III of the NRDAM/GLE technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) lists the species that the NRDAM/GLE covers;

(2) Direct loss of production of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from short-term exposure to the released substance;

(3) Indirect mortality of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from disruption of the food web by direct mortality or direct loss of production;

(4) Indirect loss of production of species covered by the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE resulting from disruption of the food web by direct mortality or direct loss of production;

(5) Lost assimilative capacity of water column and sediments;

(6) Lost economic rent for lost commercial harvests resulting from any closures specified by the authorized official and/or from population losses;

(7) Lost recreational harvests resulting from any closures specified by the authorized official and/or from population losses;

(8) For the type A procedure for coastal and marine environments, lost wildlife viewing, resulting from population losses, by residents of the States bordering the provinces in which the population losses occurred. [A province is one of the geographic areas delineated in Table 6.1, Volume I of the NRDAM/CME technical document.] For the type A procedure for Great Lakes environments, lost wildlife viewing, resulting from population losses, by residents of local areas bordering the provinces in which the population losses occurred. [A province is one of the geographic areas delineated in Table 8.1, Volume I of the NRDAM/GLE technical document.];

(9) Lost beach visitation due to closure; and

(10) For the type A procedure for Great Lakes environments, lost boating due to closure.

(c) If the authorized official uses both type A and type B procedures, he or she must explain in the Assessment Plan how he or she intends to prevent double recovery.

(d) When the authorized official uses type B procedures for injuries not addressed in a type A procedure, he or she must follow all of subpart E (which contains standards for determining and quantifying injury as well as determining damages), § 11.31(c) (which addresses content of the Assessment Plan), and § 11.37 (which addresses confirmation of exposure). When the authorized official uses type B procedures for compensable values that are not included in a type A procedure but that result from injuries that are addressed in the type A procedure, he or she need not follow all of subpart E, § 11.31(c), and § 11.37. Instead, the authorized official may rely on the injury predictions of the type A procedure and simply use the valuation methodologies authorized by § 11.83(c) to calculate compensable value. When using valuation methodologies, the authorized official must comply with § 11.84.
