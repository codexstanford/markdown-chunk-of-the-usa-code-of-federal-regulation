######## § 3602.49 When will BLM issue a non-renewable contract?

(a) BLM may offer you a contract restricted to a single term or otherwise limited in its duration. We will base this restriction on a finding that-

(1) The land should be used for another, possibly conflicting, purpose after mineral materials are removed;

(2) The deposit of mineral materials may be appropriate for future use by multiple operators or by the local community; or

(3) Other circumstances make renewal inappropriate.

(b) If BLM limits a contract under this section, the sale notice under § 3602.42 will include this information.

(c) If your contract is in existence on December 24, 2001, BLM will decide whether you may request renewal of that contract. You must ask BLM for this decision at least 90 days before the contract expires. If fewer than 120 days remain on your existing contract on December 24, 2001, BLM may approve a renewal request that you submit less than 90 days before the contract expires if we decide the contract qualifies for renewal and we have sufficient time to process your request before your contract is due to expire.
