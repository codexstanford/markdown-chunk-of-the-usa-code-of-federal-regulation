### PART 21 - OCCUPANCY OF CABIN SITES ON PUBLIC CONSERVATION AND RECREATION AREAS
#### § 21.6 Cabin site occupancy where a recreation or conservation area has been leased to, or turned over to, another Federal or non-Federal public agency for administration.

(a) After the effective date of this part, any agreement whereby a recreation or conservation area is leased or turned over to another Federal or non-Federal public agency for administration, shall include the requirement that any permits to individuals, groups or others issued or extended by another Federal or non-Federal public agency to whom an area has been leased or transferred for administration, shall comply with, and set forth on the face of the permit, the requirements stated in this part. Similar requirements shall be applied in situations where an existing agreement reserves such authority to this Department.

(b) All such arrangements between another public agency and a permittee (see § 21.2) shall be reviewed by the Authorized Officer to assure full compliance with those provisions of the permit which are designed to assure performance in the best interests of the general public.

(c) Renewals, extensions, or new leases or transfers to other Federal, State, or local agencies for administration of public recreation areas, shall be granted only pursuant to the policies set forth in this part, and only upon an affirmative finding by the Authorized Officer that they are fully consistent with present and future public uses. All applicable safeguards set forth in this part, including the protection of future public uses, shall be expressly incorporated into such leases or transfers.
