###### Subpart 2410 - General Criteria
####### § 2410.2 Relative value, disposal or retention.

When, under the criteria of this part, a tract of land has potential for either retention for multiple use management or for some form of disposal, or for more than one form of disposal, the relative scarcity of the values involved and the availability of alternative means and sites for realization of those values will be considered. Long-term public benefits will be weighed against more immediate or local benefits. The tract will then be classified in a manner which will best promote the public interests.
