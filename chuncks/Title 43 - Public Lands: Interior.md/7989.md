######## § 3809.411 What action will BLM take when it receives my plan of operations?

(a) BLM will review your plan of operations within 30 calendar days and will notify you that-

(1) Your plan of operations is complete, that is, it meets the content requirements of § 3809.401(b);

(2) Your plan does not contain a complete description of the proposed operations under § 3809.401(b). BLM will identify deficiencies that you must address before BLM can continue processing your plan of operations. If necessary, BLM may repeat this process until your plan of operations is complete; or

(3) The description of the proposed operations is complete, but BLM cannot approve the plan until certain additional steps are completed, including one or more of the following:

(i) You collect adequate baseline data;

(ii) BLM completes the environmental review required under the National Environmental Policy Act;

(iii) BLM completes any consultation required under the National Historic Preservation Act, the Endangered Species Act, or the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act;

(iv) BLM or the Department of the Interior completes other Federal responsibilities, such as Native American consultation;

(v) BLM conducts an on-site visit;

(vi) BLM completes review of public comments on the plan of operations;

(vii) For public lands where BLM does not have responsibility for managing the surface, BLM consults with the surface-managing agency;

(viii) In cases where the surface is owned by a non-Federal entity, BLM consults with the surface owner; and

(ix) BLM completes consultation with the State to ensure your operations will be consistent with State water quality requirements.

(b) Pending final approval of your plan of operations, BLM may approve any operations that may be necessary for timely compliance with requirements of Federal and State laws, subject to any terms and conditions that may be needed to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation.

(c) Following receipt of your complete plan of operations and before BLM acts on it, we will publish a notice of the availability of the plan in either a local newspaper of general circulation or a NEPA document and will accept public comment for at least 30 calendar days on your plan of operations.

(d) Upon completion of the review of your plan of operations, including analysis under NEPA and public comment, BLM will notify you that-

(1) BLM approves your plan of operations as submitted (See part 3810, subpart 3814 of this title for specific plan-related requirements applicable to operations on Stock Raising Homestead Act lands.);

(2) BLM approves your plan of operations subject to changes or conditions that are necessary to meet the performance standards of § 3809.420 and to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation. BLM may require you to incorporate into your plan of operations other agency permits, final approved engineering designs and plans, or other conditions of approval from the review of the plan of operations filed under § 3809.401(b); or

(3) BLM disapproves, or is withholding approval of your plan of operations because the plan:

(i) Does not meet the applicable content requirements of § 3809.401;

(ii) Proposes operations that are in an area segregated or withdrawn from the operation of the mining laws, unless the requirements of § 3809.100 are met; or

(iii) Proposes operations that would result in unnecessary or undue degradation of public lands.
