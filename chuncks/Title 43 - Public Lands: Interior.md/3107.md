(1) A clearly defined Federal nexus to a proposed project;

(2) The Federal cost of the project in relation to the amount of Federal resources likely to be available; and

(d) Whether the recommended project alternative is clearly supported by the feasibility study, based on application of the following factors, including the extent to which the alternative:
