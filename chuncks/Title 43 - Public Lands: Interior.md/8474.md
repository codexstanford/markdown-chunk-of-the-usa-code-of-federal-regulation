####### § 3932.20 Lease modification land availability criteria.

(a) The BLM may grant a lease modification if:

(1) There is no competitive interest in the lands covered by the modification application;

(2) The lands covered by the modification application cannot be reasonably developed as part of another independent federally-approved operation;

(3) The modification would be in the public interest; and

(4) The modification does not cause a violation of lease size limitations under § 3927.20 of this chapter or acreage limitations under § 3901.20 of this chapter.

(b) The BLM may approve adding lands covered by the modification application to the existing lease without competitive bidding, but before the BLM will approve adding lands to the lease, the applicant must pay in advance the FMV for the interests to be conveyed.

(c) Before modifying a lease, the BLM will prepare any necessary NEPA analysis covering the proposed lease area under 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508 and recover the cost of such analysis from the applicant.
