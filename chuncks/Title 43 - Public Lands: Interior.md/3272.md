##### § 422.1 Purpose of this part.

(a) This part implements Public Law No. 107-69, 115 Stat. 593 (November 12, 2001), an Act to Amend the Reclamation Recreation Management Act of 1992, by:

(1) Establishing eligibility criteria, such as fitness and training requirements, for Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement personnel to protect Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) facilities and lands; and

(2) Ensuring that Federal, State, local, and tribal law enforcement programs comply with applicable laws and regulations when they discharge the Secretary of the Interior's authority.

(b) This part does not apply to, or limit or restrict in any way, the investigative jurisdiction or exercise of law enforcement authority of any Federal law enforcement agency, under Federal law, within a Reclamation project or on Reclamation lands. The provisions of this part apply to non-Department of the Interior Federal law enforcement agents only where Reclamation has entered into a cooperative agreement or contract with a Federal law enforcement agency, pursuant to Public Law 107-69, for the services of specified individual Federal law enforcement agents.

(c) Nothing in this part shall be construed or applied to affect any existing right of a State or local government, or an Indian tribe, or their law enforcement officers, to exercise concurrent civil and criminal jurisdiction within a Reclamation project or on Reclamation lands.
