### PART 4 - DEPARTMENT HEARINGS AND APPEALS PROCEDURES
#### Subpart M - Special Procedural Rules Applicable to Appeals of Decisions Made Under OMB Circular A-76
##### § 4.1600 Purpose and nature of the appeal process.

(a) This appeals procedure embodies an informal administrative review of agency decisions made under OMB Circular A-76, and is intended to assure that such decisions are fair, equitable, and in compliance with the provisions of the Circular. This procedure provides affected parties an opportunity to request that such decisions be objectively reviewed by a party independent of the A-76 decision process.

(b) This appeals procedure is administrative rather than judicial in nature, and does not provide for a judicial review or for further levels of appeal. The decisions of the appeals official are final.

(c) This procedure is intended to protect the rights of all affected parties and, therefore, neither the procedure nor agency determinations may be subject to negotiation, arbitration, or agreements with any one of the parties.
