(a) The authorized official must perform a preliminary application of the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE with the data inputs and modifications developed under § 11.41. Volume II of the NRDAM/CME technical document (incorporated by reference, see § 11.18) describes how to apply the NRDAM/CME.

(b) If the preliminary application of the NRDAM/CME or NRDAM/GLE indicates damages in excess of $100,000, then the authorized official must decide whether to:

(1) Limit the portion of his or her claim calculated with the type A procedure to $100,000; or

(2) Compute all damages using type B procedures.
