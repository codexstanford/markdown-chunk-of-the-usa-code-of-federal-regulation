####### § 3287.2 When may BLM grant a suspension of unit obligations?

(a) BLM may grant a suspension of unit obligations when, despite the exercise of due care and diligence, the unit operator is prevented from complying with such obligations, in whole or in part, by:

(1) Acts of God;

(2) Federal, state, or municipal laws;

(3) Labor strikes;

(4) Unavoidable accidents;

(5) Uncontrollable delays in transportation;

(6) The inability to obtain necessary materials or equipment in the open market; or

(7) Other circumstances that BLM determines are beyond the reasonable control of the unit operator, such as agency timeframes required to complete environmental documents.

(b) BLM may deny the request for suspension of unit obligations when the suspension would involve a lengthy or indefinite period. For example, BLM might not approve a suspension of initial drilling obligations due to a unit operator's inability to obtain an electrical sales contract, or when poor economics affect the electrical generation market, limiting the opportunity to obtain a viable sales contract. BLM may grant a suspension of subsequent drilling obligations when it is in the public interest.
