(a) If the authorized officer determines that an operator/lessee has failed to comply with the rules of this part, the terms and conditions of the Federal lease or license, the requirements of approved exploration or resource recovery and protection plans, or orders of the authorized officer, and such noncompliance does not threaten immediate and serious damage to the mine, the deposit being mined, valuable ore-bearing mineral deposits or other resources, or affect the royalty provisions of the rules of this part, the authorized officer shall serve a notice of noncompliance upon the operator/lessee by delivery in person to him or his agent, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the operator/lessee at his last known address. Failure of the operator/lessee to take action in accordance with the notice of noncompliance within the time limits specified by the authorized officer shall be grounds for cessation of operations upon notice by the authorized officer. The authorized officer may also recommend to the authorized officer the initiation of action for cancellation of the Federal lease or license and forfeiture of any Federal lease bonds.

(b) The notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respect(s) the operator/lessee has failed to comply with the rules of this part, the terms and conditions of the Federal lease or license, the requirements of approved exploration or resource recovery and protection plans, or orders of the authorized officer, and shall specify the action that must be taken to correct such noncompliance and the time limits within which such action must be taken.

(c) If, in the judgment of the authorized officer, an operator/lessee is conducting activities which fail to comply with the rules of this part, the terms and conditions of the Federal lease or license, the requirements of approved exploration or resource recovery and protection plans, or orders of the authorized officer, and/or which threaten immediate and serious damage to the mine, the deposit being mined, valuable ore-bearing mineral deposits, or, regarding exploration, the environment, the authorized officer shall order the immediate cessation of such activities without prior notice of noncompliance.

(d) A written report shall be submitted by the operator/lessee to the authorized officer when such noncompliance has been corrected. Upon concurrence by the authorized officer that the conditions which warranted the issuance of a notice or order of noncompliance have been corrected, the authorized officer shall so notify the operator/lessee in writing.

(e) The authorized officer shall enforce requirements of SMCRA only if he finds a violation, condition, or practice that he determines to be an emergency situation for which an authorized representative of the Secretary is required to act pursuant to 30 CFR 843.11 and 843.12.
