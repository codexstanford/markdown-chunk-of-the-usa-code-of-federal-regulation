####### § 3271.14 What do I need to do to start building and testing a utilization facility if it is not located on Federal lands leased for geothermal resources?

(a) You do not need a BLM permit to construct a facility located on either:

(1) Private land; or

(2) Lands where the surface is privately owned and BLM has leased the underlying Federal geothermal resources, when the facility will utilize Federal geothermal resources.

(b) Before testing a utilization facility that is not located on Federal lands leased for geothermal resources, send us a Sundry Notice describing the testing schedule and the quantity of Federal geothermal resources you expect to be delivered to the facility during the testing. Do not start delivering Federal geothermal resources to the facility until we approve your Sundry Notice.
