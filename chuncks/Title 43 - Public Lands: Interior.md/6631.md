####### § 3213.19 What can I do if BLM notifies me that my lease is being terminated because of a violation of the law, regulations, or lease terms?

(a) You can prevent termination of your lease if, within 30 days after receipt of our notice:

(1) You correct the violation; or

(2) You show us that you cannot correct the violation during the 30-day period and that you are making a good faith attempt to correct the violation as quickly as possible, and thereafter you diligently proceed to correct the violation.

(b)(1) You may appeal the lease termination. You have 30 days after receipt of our notice to file an appeal (see parts 4 and 1840 of this title). We will stay the termination of your lease while your appeal is pending.
