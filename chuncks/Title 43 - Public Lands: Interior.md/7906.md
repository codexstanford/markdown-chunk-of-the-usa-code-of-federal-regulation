(c) A notice of noncompliance shall specify in what respects the operator is failing or has failed to comply with the requirements of the plan of operations of the provisions of applicable regulations, and shall specify the actions which are in violation of the plan or regulations and the actions which shall be taken to correct the noncompliance and the time limits, not to exceed 30 days, within which corrective action shall be taken.
