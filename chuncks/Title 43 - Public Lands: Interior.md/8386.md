####### § 3902.10 Who may hold leases.

(a) The following entities may hold leases or interests therein:

(1) Citizens of the United States;

(2) Associations (including partnerships and trusts) of such citizens; and

(3) Corporations organized under the laws of the United States or of any state or territory thereof.

(b) Citizens of a foreign country may only hold interest in leases through stock ownership, stock holding, or stock control in such domestic corporations. Foreign citizens may hold stock in United States corporations that hold leases if the Secretary has not determined that laws, customs, or regulations of their country deny similar privileges to citizens or corporations of the United States.

(c) A minor may not hold a lease. A legal guardian or trustee of a minor may hold a lease.

(d) An entity must be in compliance with Section 2(a)(2)(A) of the Act in order to hold a lease. If the BLM erroneously issues a lease to an entity that is in violation of Section 2(a)(2)(A) of the Act, the BLM will void the lease.
