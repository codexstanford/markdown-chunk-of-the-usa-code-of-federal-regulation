####### § 3281.10 How will BLM determine that I have sufficient control of the proposed unit area?

(a) BLM will determine whether:

(1) A unit operator has sufficient control of the proposed unit area by reviewing the number and location of leases and tracts committed and their geologic potential for development in relation to the entire proposed unit area; and

(2) The committed tracts provide the unit operator with sufficient control of the unit area to conduct resource exploration and development in the public interest.

(b) If BLM determines that the unit operator does not have sufficient control of the unit area, we will not approve the unit agreement.
