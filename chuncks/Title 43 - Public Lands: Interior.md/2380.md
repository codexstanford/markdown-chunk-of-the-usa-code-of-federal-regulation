(d) When the application is insufficient, the applicant must furnish the specific information requested within 30 days of receipt of notification of deficiency:

(1) If the applicant needs more time to obtain information, additional time may be granted by the appropriate Federal agency upon request of the applicant, provided the applicant agrees that the application filing date will change to the date of filing of the specific additional information.

(2) Unless extended pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, failure of the applicant to respond within the 30 day period will result in return of the application without further action.

(3) The lead agency shall keep all appropriate Federal agencies informed of actions occurring under paragraphs (d) (1) and (2) of this section, in order that such agencies may note their application records accordingly.

(e) Within 30 days of the receipt of additional information requested by the appropriate Federal agency, the applicant shall be notified in writing whether the supplemental information is sufficient.
