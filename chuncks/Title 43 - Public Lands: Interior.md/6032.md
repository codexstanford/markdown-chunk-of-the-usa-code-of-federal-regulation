####### § 3173.14 Conditions for commingling and allocation approval (surface and downhole).
######## e.g.,

(b) The BLM may also approve a CAA in instances where the proposed commingling of production involves production from Federal or Indian leases, unit PAs, or CAs that do not meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section (the commingling of leases, unit PAs, or CAs with different royalty rates or different distributions of revenue, or where the commingling involves multiple mineral ownerships). In order to be approved, a CAA under this subparagraph must meet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) through (4) of this section and at least one of the following conditions:

(1) The Federal or Indian lease, unit PA, or CA meets the definition of an economically marginal property. However, if the BLM determines that a Federal or Indian lease, unit PA, or CA included in a CAA ceases to be an economically marginal property, then this condition is no longer met;

(2) The average monthly production over the preceding 12 months for each Federal or Indian lease, unit PA, or CA proposed for the CAA on an individual basis is less than 1,000 Mcf of gas per month, or 100 bbl of oil per month;

(3) A CAA that includes Indian leases, unit PAs, or CAs has been authorized under tribal law or otherwise approved by a tribe;

(4) The CAA covers the downhole commingling of production from multiple formations that are covered by separate leases, unit PAs, or CAs, where the BLM has determined that the proposed commingling from those formations is an acceptable practice for the purpose of achieving maximum ultimate economic recovery and resource conservation; or

(5) There are overriding considerations that indicate the BLM should approve a commingling application in the public interest notwithstanding potential negative royalty impacts from the allocation method. Such considerations could include topographic or other environmental considerations that make non-commingled measurement physically impractical or undesirable, in view of where additional measurement and related equipment necessary to achieve non-commingled measurement would have to be located.
