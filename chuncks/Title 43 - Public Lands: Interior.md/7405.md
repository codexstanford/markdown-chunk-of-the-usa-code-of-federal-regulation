######## § 3503.46 When will BLM consult with Indian mineral owners when information concerning their minerals is the subject of a FOIA request?

BLM will notify the Indian mineral owner(s) identified in the records of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and the BIA, and give them a reasonable period of time to state objections to disclosure, using the standards and procedures of § 2.15(d) of this title, before making a decision about the applicability of FOIA exemption 4 to protect:

(a) information obtained from a person outside the United States Government; when

(b) following consultation with a submitter under § 2.15(d) of this title, BLM determines that the submitter does not have an interest in withholding the records that can be protected under FOIA; but

(c) BLM has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in commercial or financial injury to the Indian mineral owner(s), but is uncertain that such is the case.
