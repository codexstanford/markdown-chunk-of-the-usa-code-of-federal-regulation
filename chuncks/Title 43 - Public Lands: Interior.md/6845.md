####### § 3282.6 When must the unit operator propose to revise a participating area boundary?

(a) The unit operator must submit a written application to BLM to revise a participating area boundary no later than 60 days after receipt of the BLM determination described herein, when either:

(1) A well is completed that BLM has determined will produce or utilize in commercial quantities, and such well:

(i) Is located outside of an existing participating area; or

(ii) Drains an area outside the existing participating area; or

(2) An injection well located outside of an existing participating area is put into use that BLM has determined provides reservoir pressure support to production.

(b) The unit operator may submit a written application for a revision of a participating area when new or additional technical information or revised interpretations of any information provides a basis for revising the boundary.

(c) The unit operator may submit a written request to BLM to delay a participation area revision decision when drilling multiple wells in the unit is actively pursued or the drilling is providing additional technical information. A delay will not affect the effective date of any participation area revision (see § 3282.7). The request must include:

(1) The well locations;

(2) Anticipated spud and completion dates of each well;

(3) The timing of well testing and analyses of technical information; and

(4) The anticipated date BLM will receive the participation area revision for review.

(d) BLM will provide the unit operator with a written decision on the application to revise a participating area or the request to delay a participating area revision decision by BLM.
