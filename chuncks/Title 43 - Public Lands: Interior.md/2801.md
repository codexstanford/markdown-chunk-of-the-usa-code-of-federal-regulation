#### Subpart A - The Exchange Process
##### § 47.30 When does a land exchange advance the interests of the beneficiaries?

A determination that an exchange advances the interests of the beneficiaries must find that:

(a) The exchange supports perpetuation of the Hawaiian Home Lands Trust;

(b) The interests of the beneficiaries in obtaining non-Hawaiian home lands exceeds the interests of the beneficiaries in retaining the Hawaiian home lands proposed for the exchange, based on an evaluation of the factors in § 47.20; and

(c) The intended use of the conveyed Hawaiian home lands will not significantly conflict with the beneficiaries' interests in adjacent Hawaiian home lands.
