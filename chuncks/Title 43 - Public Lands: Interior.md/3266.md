The requirements in this section apply to Reclamation and to each law enforcement unit exercising Reclamation's law enforcement authority.

(a) The law enforcement program must provide for control, accountability, coordination, and clear lines of authority and communication.

(c) Each law enforcement contract or cooperative agreement must specifically name those individuals within the contracting agency who are authorized to exercise Reclamation law enforcement authority consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and the requirements of this part. A CLEO can authorize only duly authorized officers who meet the standards in § 422.7 to exercise law enforcement authority.

(d) Any uniform worn by law enforcement officers must display distinctive identification to ensure that the officer is:

(1) Distinguishable from non-law enforcement personnel; and

(2) Easily recognized by the public as a law enforcement officer.

(e) Officers investigating a violation of Federal law under a law enforcement contract or cooperative agreement with Reclamation will notify applicable Federal law enforcement authorities, as appropriate, pursuant to 43 U.S.C. 373b(d)(4).

(f) The LEA must:

(1) Establish an incident reporting system for incidents that occur on Reclamation lands; and

(2) Include the reporting requirements for incidents as an element of each contract or cooperative agreement.
