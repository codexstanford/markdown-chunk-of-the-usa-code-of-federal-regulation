####### § 3175.132 Testing of reference accuracy.

(a) The following reference test conditions must be maintained for the duration of the testing:

(1) Ambient air temperature must be between 59 &#xB0;F and 77 &#xB0;F and must not vary over the duration of the test by more than +/-2 &#xB0;F;

(2) Relative humidity must be between 45 percent and 75 percent and must not vary over the duration of the test by more than +/-5 percent;

(3) Atmospheric pressure must be between 12.46 psi and 15.36 psi and must not vary over the duration of the test by more than +/-0.2 psi;

(4) The transducer must be isolated from any externally induced vibrations;

(5) The transducer must be mounted according to the manufacturer's specifications in the same manner as it would be mounted in normal field operations;

(6) The transducer must be isolated from any external electromagnetic fields; and

(7) For reference accuracy testing of differential-pressure transducers, the downstream side of the transducer must be vented to the atmosphere.

(b) Before reference testing begins, the following pre-conditioning steps must be followed:

(1) After power is applied to the transducer, it must be allowed to stabilize for at least 30 minutes before applying any input pressure or temperature;

(2) The transducer must be exercised by applying three full-range traverses in each direction; and

(3) The transducer must be calibrated according to manufacturer specifications if a calibration is required or recommended by the manufacturer.

(c) Immediately following preconditioning, the transducer must be tested at least three times for accuracy under § 3175.131(h). The results of these tests must be used to determine the transducer's reference accuracy under § 3175.135.
