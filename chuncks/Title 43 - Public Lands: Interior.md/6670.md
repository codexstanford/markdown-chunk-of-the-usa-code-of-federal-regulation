###### Subpart 3250 - Exploration Operations - General
####### § 3250.11 May I conduct exploration operations on my lease, someone else's lease, or unleased land?

(a) You may request BLM approval to explore any BLM-managed public lands open to geothermal leasing, even if the lands are leased to another person. A BLM-approved exploration permit does not give you exclusive rights.

(b) If you wish to conduct operations on your lease, you may do so after we have approved your Notice of Intent to Conduct Geothermal Resource Exploration Operations. If the lands are already leased, your operations may not unreasonably interfere with or endanger those other operations or other authorized uses, or cause unnecessary or undue degradation of the lands.
