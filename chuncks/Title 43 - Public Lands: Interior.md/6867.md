####### § 3284.4 How are unit agreement terms affected after completion of the initial unit well?

(a) Upon completion of a unit well that BLM determines will produce or utilize geothermal resources in commercial quantities, the unit operator must submit a proposed participating area application under § 3282.3, and no additional drilling to meet unit obligations is required. If no additional drilling in the unit occurs, the unit area will contract to the participating area as specified in the unit agreement.

(b) If a unit operator drills a well designed to produce or utilize geothermal resources in commercial quantities, but the well will not produce commercially or is not producible, the unit operator must continue drilling additional wells within the timeframes specified in the unit agreement until a unit well is completed that BLM determines will produce or utilize geothermal resources in commercial quantities. BLM may terminate a unit if additional wells are not drilled within the timeframes specified in the unit agreement.

(c) The unit agreement will expire if no well that BLM determines will produce or utilize geothermal resources in commercial quantities is completed within the timeframes specified in the unit agreement.

(d) BLM will send the unit operator a written decision confirming that the unit agreement has been terminated or has expired.
