(e) Whether a rural water supply project helps meet applicable requirements established by law;

(f) The extent to which a rural water supply project serves Indian tribes that have nonexistent or inadequate water systems;

(g) The extent to which a rural water supply project is ineligible for comprehensive funding (sufficient to fully fund planning and construction of the entire project) through other assistance programs;

(h) The extent to which a rural water supply project is identified as a priority by state, tribal or local governments;

(i) Whether a rural water supply project incorporates an innovative approach that effectively addresses water supply problems and needs, either by applying new technology or by employing a creative administrative or cooperative solution; and

(j) Other criteria that Reclamation deems appropriate.
