####### § 3173.21 Combining production downhole in certain circumstances.
######## e.g.,

(a)(1) Combining production from a single well drilled into different hydrocarbon pools or geologic formations (a directional well) underlying separate adjacent properties (whether Federal, Indian, State, or private), where none of the hydrocarbon pools or geologic formations underlie or are common to more than one of the respective properties, constitutes commingling for purposes of §§ 3173.14 through 3173.20.

(2) If any of the hydrocarbon pools or geologic formations underlie or are common to more than one of the properties, the operator must establish a unit PA (see 43 CFR part 3180) or CA (see 43 CFR 3105.2-1-3105.2-3), as applicable, rather than applying for a CAA.

(b) Combining production downhole from different geologic formations on the same lease, unit PA, or CA in a single well requires approval of the AO (see 43 CFR 3162.3-2), but it is not considered commingling for production accounting purposes.
