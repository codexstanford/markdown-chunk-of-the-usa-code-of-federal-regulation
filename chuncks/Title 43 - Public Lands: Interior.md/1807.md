(a) The Department of the Interior may indemnify a Department employee, who is personally named as a defendant in any civil suit in state or federal court or an arbitration proceeding or other proceeding seeking damages against a Department employee personally, for any verdict, judgment, or other monetary award which is rendered against such employee, provided that the conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment, or award was taken within the scope of his or her employment and that such indemnification is in the interest of the Department of the Interior as determined by the Secretary or his designee.

(b) The Department of the Interior may settle or compromise a personal damage claim against a Department employee by the payment of available funds, at any time, provided the alleged conduct giving rise to the personal damage claim was taken within the employee's scope of employment and that such settlement or compromise is in the interest of the Department of the Interior as determined by the Secretary or his designee.
