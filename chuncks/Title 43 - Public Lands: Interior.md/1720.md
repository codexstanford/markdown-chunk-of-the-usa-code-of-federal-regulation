#### Subpart A - National Wilderness Preservation System
##### § 19.3 Reviews of roadless areas and roadless islands.

(a) The Secretary is required by section 3(c) of the Wilderness Act to review every roadless area of 5,000 contiguous acres or more in each unit of the National Park System and every roadless area of 5,000 contiguous acres or more and every roadless island in the national wildlife refuges and game ranges of the National Wildlife Refuge System, which was under the supervision of the Secretary on September 3, 1964. The Secretary is further required to recommend to the President whether each such area and island is suitable or not suitable for preservation as wilderness. Reports and recommendations must be submitted by the Secretary in time to permit the President to advise the Congress of his recommendations thereon:

(1) Covering not less than one-third of such areas and islands by September 3, 1967;

(2) Covering not less than an additional one-third by not later than September 3, 1971; and

(3) Covering the remainder by not later than September 3, 1974.

(b) The primary objective of the Department of the Interior's review of roadless areas and roadless islands pursuant to section 3(c) of the Wilderness Act and the regulations of this part shall be to identify and recommend for preservation as wilderness, by inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System, those areas which, after consideration of all relevant factors, it is concluded will achieve the policy of the Congress, as expressed in section 2(a) of the Wilderness Act.

(c) Nothing in the sections of this part shall, by implication or otherwise, be construed to lessen the authority of the Secretary with respect to the maintenance of roadless areas within units of the National Park System or the maintenance of roadless areas and islands within units of the National Wildlife Refuge System.
