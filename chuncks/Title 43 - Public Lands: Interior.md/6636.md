####### § 3214.14 May BLM increase the bond amount above the minimum?

(a) BLM may increase the bond amount above the minimums referenced in § 3214.13 when:

(1) We determine that the operator has a history of noncompliance;

(2) We previously had to make a claim against a surety because any one person who is covered by the new bond failed to plug and abandon a well and reclaim the surface in a timely manner;

(3) MMS has notified BLM that a person covered by the bond owes uncollected royalties; or

(4) We determine that the bond amount will not cover the estimated reclamation cost.

(b) We may increase bond amounts to any level, but we will not set that amount higher than the total estimated costs of plugging wells, removing structures, and reclaiming the surface and other resources, plus any uncollected royalties due MMS or moneys owed to BLM due to previous violations.
