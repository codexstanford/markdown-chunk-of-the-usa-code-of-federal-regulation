####### § 2812.3-6 Duration and location of rights granted or received by the United States.

The rights-of-way granted by the United States under any permit issued under § 2812.6, subject to the provisions of § 2812.7, will be for a stated term or terms which may vary for each portion of the right-of-way granted; such term or terms will normally be coincident with the probable period of use for the removal of forest products by the permittee and any successor in interest of the various portions of the right-of-way requested. In the same manner the permit will also state the duration of the rights of the United States to use and to permit its licensees to use, and the location by legal subdivisions of, each of the various portions, if any, of the roads, rights-of-way, and lands which a permittee hereunder authorizes the United States and its licensees to use; and, similarly, the duration of such rights received by the United States will normally be coincident with the probable period of use for the removal of forest products, by the United States and its existing and prospective licensees, of such roads, rights-of-way, and lands.
