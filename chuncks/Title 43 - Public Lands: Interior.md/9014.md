####### § 9239.0-9 Sale, lease, permit, or license to trespassers.

(a) For the purpose of this section, a trespasser is any person, partnership, association, or corporation responsible for the unlawful use of, or injury to, property of the United States.

(b) The authorized officer may refuse to sell to a trespasser timber or materials, or to issue to him a lease, permit, or license if, after a demand for payment has been served by certified or registered mail on the trespasser, a satisfactory arrangement for payment of the debt due the United States has not been made within reasonable time, and there is reason for the authorized officer to believe payment will not be made. Satisfactory arrangement shall be deemed to have been made by:

(1) Payment by the trespasser of the amount found to be due by the authorized officer, by a final judgment of a court, or pursuant to a compromise settlement accepted by the United States; or

(2) Execution by the trespasser of a promissory note or installment agreement, satisfactory to the authorized officer, so long as the agreed-upon payments are made on schedule; or

(3) Delivery by the trespasser of a bond guaranteeing payment to the United States of the amount found to be due by the authorized officer or by a court of competent jurisdiction; or

(4) Cancellation of the debt due the United States by a discharge in bankruptcy.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the authorized officer may sell to a trespasser timber or materials or issue to him a lease, permit, or license for materials despite lack of a satisfactory arrangement for payment if such officer establishes in writing that:

(1) There is no other qualified bidder or no other qualified bidder will meet the high bid, and

(2) The sale, lease, permit, or license to the trespasser is necessary to protect substantial interests of the United States either by preventing deterioration of, or damage to, resources of the United States or by accepting an advantageous offer, and

(3) The timber management or other resource management program of the United States will not be adversely affected by the action.
