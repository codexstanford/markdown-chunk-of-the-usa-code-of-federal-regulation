##### Monitoring Diversions
###### § 418.15 Operations monitoring.

(a) The Bureau will work with the District to monitor Project operations and will perform field inspections of water distribution during the irrigation season.

(1) Staff members of the Bureau's Lahontan Area Office and the District will meet as often as necessary during the irrigation season after each water distribution report has been prepared to examine the amounts of water used to that point in the season.

(2) On the basis of the information obtained from field observations, water use records, and consultations with District staff, the Bureau will determine at monthly intervals whether the rate of diversion is consistent with this part for that year.

(3) The District will be informed in writing of suggested adjustments that may be made in management of diversions and releases as necessary to achieve target efficiencies and stay within the MAD.

(b) Project operations will be monitored in part by measuring flows at key locations. Specifically, Project diversions (used in the calculations under § 418.18 below) will be determined by:

(1) Adding flows measured at:

(i) Truckee Canal near Wadsworth-U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauge number 10351300;

(ii) Carson River below Lahontan Dam-USGS gauge number 10312150;

(iii) Rock Dam Ditch near the end of the concrete lining; and

(2) Subtracting:

(i) Flows measured at the Truckee Canal near Hazen-USGS gauge number 10351400;

(ii) The Carson River at Tarzyn Road near Fallon (below Sagouspe Dam) for satisfying water rights outside of the Project boundaries as described in § 418.25, USGS gauge number 10312275;

(iii) Estimated losses in the Truckee Canal; and

(iv) Spills, precautionary drawdown, and incentive water released at Lahontan Dam under §§ 418.24 and 418.36.
