(1) The heir or devisee of the share to be purchased;

(2) Any surviving spouse whose share is to be purchased and who receives a life estate under 25 U.S.C. 2206(a)(2)(A) or (D); or

(3) Any recipient of an interest received under an approved consolidation agreement whose share is to be purchased.

(b) If consent is required from an heir or devisee for a purchase at probate, the consent may be given either:

(1) During a hearing as part of the record; or

(2) In writing to OHA.

(c) An heir or devisee's failure to attend a hearing or respond to an order will not be presumed to constitute consent.

(2) When OHA receives such notice, it will deny the request to purchase the property interest to which the notice applies.

(4) The heir or surviving spouse is not a member of your Tribe or eligible to become a member; and

(5) The interest is not included in an approved consolidation agreement.
