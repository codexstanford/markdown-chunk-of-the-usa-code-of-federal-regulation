(a) If a tribe files a written notice of purchase under § 30.261(a), a judge will determine:

(1) The entitlement of a tribe to purchase a decedent's interests in trust or restricted land under the applicable statute;

(2) The entitlement of a surviving spouse to reserve a life estate in one-half of the surviving spouse's interests that have been purchased by a tribe; and

(3) The fair market value of such interests, as determined by an appraisal or other valuation method developed by the Secretary under 25 U.S.C. 2214, including the value of any life estate reserved by a surviving spouse.

(b) In making a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the following issues will be determined by the official tribal roll, which is binding on the judge:

(1) Enrollment or refusal of the tribe to enroll a specific individual; and

(2) Specification of blood quantum, where pertinent.

(c) For good cause shown, the judge may stay the probate proceeding to permit an interested party who is adversely affected to pursue an enrollment application, grievance, or appeal through the established procedures applicable to the tribe.
