####### § 2201.1-3 Assumption of costs.

(a) Generally, parties to an exchange will bear their own costs of the exchange. However, if the authorized officer finds it is in the public interest, subject to the conditions and limitations specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an agreement to initiate an exchange may provide that:

(1) One or more of the parties may assume, without compensation, all or part of the costs or other responsibilities or requirements that the authorized officer determines would ordinarily be borne by the other parties; or

(2) The parties may agree to make adjustments to the relative values involved in an exchange transaction in order to compensate parties for assuming costs or other responsibilities or requirements that the authorized officer determines would ordinarily be borne by the other parties. These costs or services may include but are not limited to: Land surveys, appraisals, mineral examinations, timber cruises, title searches, title curative actions, cultural resource surveys and mitigation, hazardous substance surveys and controls, removal of encumbrances, arbitration including all fees, bargaining, cure of deficiencies preventing highest and best use of the land, conduct of public hearings, assemblage of non-Federal parcels from multiple ownerships, expenses of complying with laws, regulations, and policies applicable to exchange transactions, and expenses that are necessary to bring the Federal and non-Federal lands involved in the exchange to their highest and best use for appraisal and exchange purposes.

(b) The authorized officer may agree to assume without compensation costs ordinarily borne under local custom or practice by the non-Federal party or to compensate the non-Federal party for costs ordinarily borne under local custom or practice by the United States but incurred by the non-Federal party, but only when it is clearly in the public interest and the authorized officer determines and documents that each of the following circumstances exist:

(1) The amount of the cost assumed or compensation is reasonable and accurately reflects the value of the goods and services received;

(2) The proposed exchange is a high priority of the agency;

(3) The land exchange must be expedited to protect important Federal resource values, such as congressionally designated areas or endangered species habitat;

(4) Cash equalization funds are available for compensating the non-Federal party; and

(5) There are no other practicable means available to the authorized officer of meeting Federal exchange processing costs, responsibilities, or requirements.

(c) The total amount of adjustment agreed to as compensation for costs incurred pursuant to this section shall not exceed the limitations set forth in § 2201.6 of this part.
