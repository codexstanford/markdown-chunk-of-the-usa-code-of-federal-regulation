###### Subpart 3178 - Royalty-Free Use of Lease Production
####### § 3178.5 Uses of oil or gas on a lease, unit, or communitized area that require prior written BLM approval for royalty-free treatment of volumes used.

(a) Oil or gas produced from a lease, unit, or communitized area may also be used royalty-free for the following operations and production purposes on the lease, unit, or communitized area, but prior written BLM approval is required to ensure that production accountability is maintained:

(1) Use of oil or gas that the operator removes from the pipeline at a location downstream of the Facility Measurement Point (FMP);

(2) Use of gas that has been removed from the lease, unit PA, or communitized area for treatment or processing because of particular physical characteristics of the gas that require the gas to be treated or processed prior to use, where the gas is returned to, and used on, the lease, unit PA, or communitized area from which it was produced; and

(3) Any other types of use of produced oil or gas for operations and production purposes, which are not identified in § 3178.4.

(b)(1) The operator must obtain BLM approval to conduct activities under paragraph (a) of this section by submitting a Form 3160-5, Sundry Notices and Reports on Wells (Sundry Notice) containing the information required under § 3178.9. If the BLM disapproves a request for royalty-free treatment for volumes used under this section, the operator must pay royalties on such volumes. If the BLM approves a request for royalty-free treatment for volumes used under this section, such approval will be deemed effective from the date the request was filed.

(2) With respect to uses under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the operator must measure the volume of oil or gas used in accordance with Onshore Oil and Gas Orders No. 4 (oil) and 5 (gas) as applicable, or other successor regulations.

(3) With respect to removals under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the operator must measure any gas returned to the lease, unit, or communitized area under such an approval in accordance with Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 5 or other successor regulations.
