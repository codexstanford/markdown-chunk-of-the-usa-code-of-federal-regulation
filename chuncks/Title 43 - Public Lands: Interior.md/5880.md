####### § 3162.2-9 What is my duty to inquire about the potential for drainage and inform BLM of my findings?

(a) When you first acquire a lease interest, and at all times while you hold the lease interest, you must monitor the drilling of wells in the same or adjacent spacing units and gather sufficient information to determine whether drainage is occurring. This information can be in various forms, including but not limited to, well completion reports, sundry notices, or available production information. As a prudent lessee, it is your responsibility to analyze and evaluate this information and make the necessary calculations to determine:

(1) The amount of drainage from production of the draining well;

(2) The amount of mineral resources which will be drained from your Federal or Indian lease during the life of the draining well; and

(3) Whether a protective well would be economic to drill.

(b) You must notify BLM within 60 days from the date of actual or constructive notice of:

(1) Which of the actions in § 3162.2-4 you will take; or

(2) The reasons a protective well would be uneconomic.

(c) If you do not have sufficient information to comply with § 3162.2-9(b)(1), indicate when you will provide the information.

(d) You must provide BLM with the analysis under paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days after we request it.
