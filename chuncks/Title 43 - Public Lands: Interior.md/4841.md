(a) Before filing an application with BLM, we encourage you to make an appointment for a preapplication meeting with the appropriate personnel in the BLM field office having jurisdiction over the lands you seek to use. During the preapplication meeting, BLM can:

(1) Identify potential routing and other constraints;

(2) Determine whether the lands are located inside a designated or existing right-of-way corridor or a designated leasing area;

(3) Tentatively schedule the processing of your proposed application; and

(4) Inform you of your financial obligations, such as processing and monitoring costs and rents.

(b) Subject to § 2804.13 of this subpart, BLM may share any information you provide under paragraph (a) of this section with Federal, state, tribal, and local government agencies to ensure that:

(1) These agencies are aware of any authorizations you may need from them; and

(2) We initiate effective coordinated planning as soon as possible.
