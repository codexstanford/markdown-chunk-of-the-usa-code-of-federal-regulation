######## § 3809.400 Does this subpart apply to my existing or pending plan of operations?

(a) You may continue to operate under the terms and conditions of a plan of operations that BLM approved before January 20, 2001. All provisions of this subpart except plan content (§ 3809.401) and performance standards (§§ 3809.415 and 3809.420) apply to such plan of operations. See § 3809.505 for the applicability of financial guarantee requirements.

(See 43 CFR parts 1000-end, revised as of Oct. 1, 1999.) All other provisions of this subpart apply.

(c) If you want this subpart to apply to any existing or pending plan of operations, where not otherwise required, you may choose to have this subpart apply.
