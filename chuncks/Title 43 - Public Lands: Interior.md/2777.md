(a) A bureau must ensure that an environmental assessment is prepared for all proposed Federal actions, except those:

(1) That are covered by a categorical exclusion;

(2) That are covered sufficiently by an earlier environmental document as determined and documented by the Responsible Official; or

(3) For which the bureau has already decided to prepare an environmental impact statement.

(b) A bureau may prepare an environmental assessment for any proposed action at any time to:

(1) Assist in planning and decision-making;

(2) Further the purposes of NEPA when no environmental impact statement is necessary; or

(3) Facilitate environmental impact statement preparation.
