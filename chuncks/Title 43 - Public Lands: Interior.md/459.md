(a) The administrative law judge may in his discretion, on his own motion or on motion of one of the parties, or of the Bureau, direct the parties or their representatives to appear at a specified time and place for a prehearing conference to consider:

(1) The simplification of the issues,

(2) The necessity of amendments to the pleadings,

(3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions of facts and agreements to the introduction of documents,

(4) The limitation of the number of expert witnesses, and

(5) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the proceedings.

(b) The administrative law judge shall make an order which recites the action taken at the conference, the amendments allowed to the pleadings, and the agreements made as to any of the matters considered, and which limits the issues for hearing to those not disposed of by admission or agreements. Such order shall control the subsequent course of the proceedings before the administrative law judge unless modified for good cause, by subsequent order.
