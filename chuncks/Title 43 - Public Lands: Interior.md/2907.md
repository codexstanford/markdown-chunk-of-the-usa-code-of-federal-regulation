##### § 49.200 Where are collections deposited?

(a) A collection from Federal land made pursuant to a permit issued under this part will be deposited in a repository approved to receive the collection.

(b) The curation of paleontological resources collected from Federal land before September 1, 2022 is governed by the terms and conditions of the original collection permit or agreement, rather than by this part.

(c) The Federal land manager, in coordination with the permittee and repository staff, will ensure that the specimens in the collection that further paleontological knowledge, public education, or management of paleontological resources are curated in the approved repository. Specimens that do not further paleontological knowledge, public education, or management of paleontological resources may be placed in working collections or disposed of as determined by the Federal land manager in coordination with appropriate subject matter experts.
