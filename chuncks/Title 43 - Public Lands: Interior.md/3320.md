(a) This part and all applicable Federal, State, and local laws apply to all persons on Reclamation facilities, lands, and waterbodies, with the following exceptions:

(2) Certain exceptions apply to non-Federal entities, as further addressed in paragraph (c) of this section;

(4) Certain exceptions apply on Reclamation facilities, lands, and waterbodies subject to treaties and Federal laws concerning tribes and Indians, as further addressed in paragraph (e) of this section.

(b) This part does not apply to:

(1) Federal, State, and local law enforcement, fire, and rescue personnel in the performance of their official duties on Reclamation facilities, lands, and waterbodies;

(2) An employee or agent of the Federal, State, or local government, or other political subdivision, when the employee or agent is carrying out official duties; or

(3) An employee or agent of an entity that has entered into a contract or agreement with Reclamation to administer, operate, maintain, patrol, or provide security for Reclamation facilities, lands, and waterbodies, when the employee or agent is working within the scope of the defined activities described in the contract or agreement.

(c) If a non-Federal entity has assumed responsibility for operating, maintaining, or managing Reclamation facilities, lands, or waterbodies through a contract or other written agreement, public conduct in and on those Reclamation facilities, lands, and waterbodies will be regulated by this part 423 as well as any regulations established by the entity, the terms of the entity's contract with Reclamation, and applicable Federal, State, and local law.

(d) Public conduct on Reclamation facilities, lands, and waterbodies administered by other Federal agencies under statute or other authority will be governed by the regulations of those agencies rather than this part 423.

(e) This part applies on all Reclamation facilities, lands, and waterbodies that are subject to Treaties with, and Federal laws concerning the rights of, federally recognized tribes, and individual Indians who are members thereof, to the extent that this part is consistent with those Treaties and Federal laws.
