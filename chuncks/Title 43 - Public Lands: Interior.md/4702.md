###### Subpart 2711 - Sales: Procedures
####### § 2711.3-3 Direct sales.

(a) Direct sales (without competition) may be utilized, when in the opinion of the authorized officer, a competitive sale is not appropriate and the public interest would best be served by a direct sale. Examples include, but are not limited to:

(1) A tract identified for transfer to State or local government or nonprofit organization; or

(2) A tract identified for sale that is an integral part of a project or public importance and speculative bidding would jeopardize a timely completion and economic viability of the project; or

(3) There is a need to recognize an authorized use such as an existing business which could suffer a substantial economic loss if the tract were purchased by other than the authorized user; or

(4) The adjoining ownership pattern and access indicate a direct sale is appropriate; or

(5) A need to resolve inadvertent unauthorized use or occupancy of the lands.

(b) Once the authorized officer has determined that the lands will be offered by direct sale and such determination has been issued, published and sent in accordance with procedures of this part, payment shall be made by the same instruments as authorized in § 2711.3-1(c) of this subpart.

(c) Failure to accept an offer to purchase the offered lands within the time specified by the authorized officer shall constitute a waiver of this preference consideration.

(d) Acceptance or rejection of an offer to purchase the lands shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 2711.3-1 (f) and (g) of this subpart.
