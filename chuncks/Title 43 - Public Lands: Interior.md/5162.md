####### § 2884.10 What should I do before I file my application?

(a) When you determine that a proposed oil and gas pipeline system would cross Federal lands under BLM jurisdiction, or under the jurisdiction of two or more Federal agencies, you should notify BLM.

(b) Before filing an application with BLM, we encourage you to make an appointment for a preapplication meeting with the appropriate personnel in the BLM field office nearest the lands you seek to use. During the preapplication meeting BLM can:

(1) Identify potential routing and other constraints;

(2) Determine whether or not the lands are located within a designated or existing right-of-way corridor;

(3) Tentatively schedule the processing of your proposed application;

(4) Provide you information about qualifications for holding grants and TUPs, and inform you of your financial obligations, such as processing and monitoring costs and rents; and

(5) Identify any work which will require obtaining one or more TUPs.

(c) BLM may share this information with Federal, state, tribal, and local government agencies to ensure that these agencies are aware of any authorizations you may need from them.

(d) BLM will keep confidential any information in your application that you mark as "confidential" or "proprietary" to the extent allowed by law.
