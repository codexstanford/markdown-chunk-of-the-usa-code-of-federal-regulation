##### § 6.51 Purpose.

It is the purpose of the regulations in this subpart to secure for the people of the United States the full benefits of Government research and investigation in the Department of the Interior (a) by providing a simple procedure under which the public may obtain licenses to use patents and inventions in which the Secretary of the Interior has transferable interests and which are available for licensing; and (b) by providing adequate protection for the inventions until such time as they may be made available for licensing without undue risk of losing patent protection to which the public is entitled.
