(d) The filing of an application under the regulations of this section will constitute a request for withdrawal of the lands, and will segregate the lands from all other forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including the mining and mineral leasing laws, and from selection under the Alaska Statehood Act, as amended, subject to valid existing rights, but will not segregate the lands from selections under section 12 or 16 of the Act. The segregative effect of such an application will terminate if the application is rejected.
