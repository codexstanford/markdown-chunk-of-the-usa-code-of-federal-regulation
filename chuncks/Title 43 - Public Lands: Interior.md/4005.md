(3) A description of the goods and services and their corresponding costs for which the noncomplying party is liable in the event of failure to perform or to comply with the terms of the exchange agreement; and

(4) The agreed upon values of the involved lands.

(b) An exchange agreement, as described in paragraph (a) of this section, is legally binding on all parties, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, provided:

(1) Acceptable title can be conveyed;

(2) No substantial loss or damage occurs to either property from any cause;

(3) No undisclosed hazardous substances are found on the involved Federal or non-Federal lands prior to conveyance;

(4) In the event of a protest, or of an appeal from a protest decision under 43 CFR part 4, a decision to approve an exchange pursuant to § 2201.7-1 is upheld; and

(5) The agreement is not terminated by mutual consent or upon such terms as may be provided in the agreement.

(c) Absent an executed legally binding exchange agreement, any action taken by one or more of the parties, or a failure of one or more of the parties to take any action, prior to consummation of an exchange does not create any legal obligation or right enforceable against or enjoyed by any party.
