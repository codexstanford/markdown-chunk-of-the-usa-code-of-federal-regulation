The operator, licensee, or lessee must notify the BLM when noncompliance items have been corrected.

(2) If the operator, licensee, or lessee does not comply with the notice of noncompliance or order within the specified time frame, the operator, licensee, or lessee may be ordered to pay an assessment of $500 per day for each incident of noncompliance that is not corrected until the noncompliance is corrected to the BLM's satisfaction.
