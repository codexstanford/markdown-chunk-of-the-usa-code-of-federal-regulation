##### PART 3710 - PUBLIC LAW 167; ACT OF JULY 23, 1955
###### Subpart 3715 - Use and Occupancy Under the Mining Laws
####### § 3715.4 What if I have an existing use or occupancy?

(a) By August 18, 1997, all existing uses and occupancies must meet the applicable requirements of this subpart. If not, BLM will either issue you a notice of noncompliance or order any existing use or occupancy failing to meet the requirements of this subpart to suspend or cease under § 3715.7-1. BLM will also order you to reclaim the land under 43 CFR part 3800, subpart 3802 or 3809 to BLM's satisfaction within a specified, reasonable time, unless otherwise expressly authorized.

(b) If you are occupying the public lands under the mining laws on August 15, 1996, you may continue your occupancy for one year after that date, without being subject to the procedures this subpart imposes, if:

(1) You notify BLM by October 15, 1996 of the existence of the occupancy using a format specified by BLM; and

(2) BLM has no pending trespass action against you concerning your occupancy.

(c) The one-year grace period provided in paragraph (b) of this section will not apply if at any time BLM determines that your use or occupancy is not reasonably incident and the continued presence of the use or occupancy is a threat to health, safety or the environment. In this situation, BLM will order an immediate temporary suspension of activities under § 3715.7-1(a).

(d) If you have no existing occupancies, but are engaged in uses of the public lands under the mining law, you are subject to the standards in § 3715.5. BLM will determine if your existing uses comply with those standards during normal inspection visits to the area and during BLM review of notices and plans of operations filed under 43 CFR part 3800.
