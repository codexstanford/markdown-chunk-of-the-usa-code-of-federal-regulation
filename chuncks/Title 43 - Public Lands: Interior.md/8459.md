####### § 3930.40 Assessments for missing diligence milestones.

The BLM will assess $50 for each acre in the lease for each missed diligence milestone each year, prorated on a daily basis, until the operator or lessee complies with § 3930.30(a). For example: If the operator does not submit the required POD within the required 2 years after lease issuance (the first milestone), the BLM will assess the operator $50 per acre per year until the milestone is met. If the operator does not meet the second milestone, the BLM will assess the operator an additional $50 per acre per year, resulting in a total assessment of $100 per acre per year. If the operator does not begin production by the end of the initial lease term, or make payments in lieu thereof, the BLM may initiate lease cancellation procedures (see §§ 3934.21 and 3934.22).
