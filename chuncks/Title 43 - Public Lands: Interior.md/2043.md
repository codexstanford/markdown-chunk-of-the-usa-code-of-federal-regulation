##### § 30.125 May a judge order that a property interest be partitioned as a result of a devise?

(a) A judge may order a property interest to be partitioned if:

(1) A will attempts to divide an allotment into two or more distinct portions and devises at least one of those portions;

(2) The decedent was the sole owner of the allotment;

(3) The allotment is held entirely in trust or restricted status; and

(4) The devise describes the portions of the allotment in a manner that allows the judge to readily ascertain which portion of the allotment descends to each intended devisee.

(b) If the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are not met, the judge may find that a devise of a portion of an undivided allotment fails.
