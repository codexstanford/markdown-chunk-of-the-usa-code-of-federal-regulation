(2) Any special weight distribution that would require special train handling procedures;

(3) The number and location of cars with cut-out or otherwise inoperative brakes and the location where they will be repaired;

(4) If a Class I or Class IA brake test is required prior to the next crew change point, the location at which that test shall be performed; and

(5) Any train brake system problems encountered by the previous crew of the train.
