In petitions to revoke an exemption, a party must indicate in the petition whether it is seeking discovery. If it is, the party must file its discovery requests at the same time it files its petition to revoke. Discovery shall be completed 30 days after the petition to revoke is filed. The party seeking discovery may supplement its petition to revoke 45 days after the petition is filed. Replies to the supplemental petition are due 15 days after the supplemental petition is filed.
