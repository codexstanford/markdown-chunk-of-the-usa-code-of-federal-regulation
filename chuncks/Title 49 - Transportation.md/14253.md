##### § 262.13 Matching requirements.

(a) A State or other non-Federal entity shall pay at least ten percent of the construction costs of a project that is funded in part by the grant awarded under this section.

(b) The non-Federal share required by paragraph (a) of this section may be paid in cash or in-kind. In-kind contributions that are permitted to be counted under this section are as follows:

(1) A contribution of real property or tangible personal property (whether provided by the State or a person for the state) needed for the project;

(2) A contribution of the services of employees of the State or other non-Federal entity or allowable costs, calculated on the basis of costs incurred by the State or other non-Federal entity for the pay and benefits of the employees, but excluding overhead and general administrative costs;

(3) A payment of any allowable costs that were incurred for the project before the filing of an application for a grant for the project under this part, and any in-kind contributions that were made for the project before the filing of the application; if and to the extent that the costs were incurred or in-kind contributions were made, as the case may be, to comply with a provision of a statute required to be satisfied in order to carry out the project.

(c) In determining whether to approve an application, FRA will consider the feasibility of seeking financial contributions or commitments from private entities involved with the project in proportion to the expected benefits determined under § 262.11(b) that accrue to such entities from the project.
