(2) The principal shall then file, or if not a Registered Importer, shall then cause the Registered Importer of the vehicle to file, with the Administrator, a certificate that the vehicle complies with each Federal motor vehicle safety standard in the year that the vehicle was manufactured and which applies in such year to the vehicle, and that the vehicle complies with the Federal bumper standard (if applicable);

(3) The principal, if a Registered Importer, shall not release custody of the vehicle to any person for license or registration for use on public roads, streets, or highways, or license or register the vehicle from the date of entry until 30 calendar days after it has certified compliance of the vehicle to the Administrator, unless the Administrator notifies the principal before 30 calendar days that (s)he has accepted such certification and the vehicle and bond may be released, except that no such release shall be permitted, before or after the 30th calendar day, if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that an inspection of such vehicle will be required, or that there is reason to believe that such certification is false or contains a misrepresentation.

(4) And if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that an inspection is required, the principal shall cause the vehicle to be available for inspection, and the vehicle and bond shall be promptly released after completion of an inspection showing no failure to comply. However, if the inspection shows a failure to comply, the vehicle and bond shall not be released until such time as the failure to comply ceases to exist;

(6) And if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that the vehicle has been found not to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards, and written demand that the vehicle be abandoned to the United States, or delivered to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export (at no cost to the United States), the principal shall abandon the vehicle to the United States, or shall deliver the vehicle, or cause the vehicle to be delivered to, the custody of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection at the port of entry listed above, or any other port of entry, and shall execute all documents necessary for exportation of the vehicle from the United States, at no cost to the United States; or in default of abandonment or redelivery after proper notice by the Administrator to the principal, the principal shall pay to the Administrator the amount of this obligation;

Then this obligation shall be void; otherwise it shall remain in full force and effect.
