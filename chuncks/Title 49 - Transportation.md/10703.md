(2) The dissemination of the policy statement; complaint procedures. Each railroad shall provide to all employees, supervisory personnel, and management the policy statement described in paragraph (a)(1).

These procedures shall be disclosed to railroad employees, supervisors, managers, and officers. The railroad shall provide "whistle blower" protection to any person subject to this policy, and such policy shall be disclosed to all railroad employees, supervisors and management.
