(1) The name and address of the supplier;

(2) A description of the unique type of equipment;

(3) The price of the equipment to the manufacturer;

(4) The percentage U.S./Canadian content of the equipment, determined under § 583.6(c);

If the unique type of equipment supplied by the supplier is expected to vary with respect to price, content, and country of origin during that period, the supplier shall base its estimates on expected averages for these factors.
