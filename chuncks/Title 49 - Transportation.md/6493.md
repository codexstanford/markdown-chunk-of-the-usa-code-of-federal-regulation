####### § 178.337-13 Supporting and anchoring.

(a) A cargo tank that is not permanently attached to or integral with a vehicle chassis must be secured by the use of restraining devices designed to prevent relative motion between the cargo tank and the vehicle chassis when the vehicle is in operation. Such restraining devices must be readily accessible for inspection and maintenance.

A cargo tank mounted on a motor vehicle frame must be supported by external cradles or longitudinal members. Where used, the cradles must subtend at least 120 degrees of the shell circumference.

(c) The design calculations of the support elements must satisfy the requirements of § 178.337-3, (a), (b), (c), and (d).

(d) Where any cargo tank support is attached to any part of a cargo tank head, the stresses imposed upon the head must be provided for as required in paragraph (c) of this section.
