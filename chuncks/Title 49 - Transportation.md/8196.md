When an operator has knowledge that the support for a segment of a buried cast-iron pipeline is disturbed:

(1) Vibrations from heavy construction equipment, trains, trucks, buses, or blasting;

(2) Impact forces by vehicles;

(3) Earth movement;

(4) Apparent future excavations near the pipeline; or

(5) Other foreseeable outside forces which may subject that segment of the pipeline to bending stress.
