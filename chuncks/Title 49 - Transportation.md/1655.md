###### § 29.918 What information must the Self-Governance Official's decision contain?

(a) The Self-Governance Official's decision must:

(1) Describe the claim or dispute;

(2) Reference the relevant terms of the compact or funding agreement;

(3) Set forth the factual areas of agreement and disagreement; and

(4) Set forth the Self-Governance Official's decision, and provide the facts and reasons that support the decision.

(b) The Self-Governance Official must provide the decision to the Tribe and describe the Tribe's appeal rights in language similar to the following:

This is a final decision. You may appeal this decision to the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA), 1800 F Street NW, Washington, DC 20245. If you decide to appeal, you must provide written notice within 90 days of receipt of this decision to the CBCA and provide a copy to the Self-Governance Official. The notice must indicate that an appeal is intended, and refer to the decision and contract number. Instead of appealing to the CBCA, you may bring an action in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims or U.S. District Courts within 12 months of the date you receive this notice. If you do not appeal a decision within one of these time periods, it is not subject to further review.
