(a) If the proposed action affects land or water uses within a State coastal zone designated pursuant to the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1451) applicant must comply with the following procedures:

(1) If the proposed action is listed as subject to review in the State's coastal zone management plan, applicant (with, or prior to its filing) must certify (pursuant to 15 CFR 930.57 and 930.58) that the proposed action is consistent with the coastal zone management plan.

(2) If the activity is not listed, applicant (with, or prior to its filing) must certify that actual notice of the proposal was given to the State coastal zone manager at least 40 days before the effective date of the requested action.

(b) If there is consistency review under 15 CFR 930.54, the Board and the applicant will comply with the consistency certification procedures of 15 CFR 930. Also, the Board will withhold a decision, stay the effective date of a decision, or impose a condition delaying consummation of the action, until the applicant has submitted a consistency certification and either the state has concurred in the consistency certification, or an appeal to the Secretary of Commerce (under 15 CFR 930.64(e)) is successful.
