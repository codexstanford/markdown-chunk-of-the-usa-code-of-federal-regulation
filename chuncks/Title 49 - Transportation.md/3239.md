(a) The Associate Administrator reviews an application for a special permit, modification of a special permit, party to a special permit, or renewal of a special permit in conformance with the standard operating procedures specified in appendix A of this part ("Standard Operating Procedures for Special Permits and Approvals") to determine if it is complete and conforms with the requirements of this subpart. This determination will typically be made within 30 days of receipt of the application for a special permit, modification of a special permit, or party to a special permit, and typically within 15 days of receipt of an application for renewal of a special permit. If an application is determined to be incomplete, the Associate Administrator may reject the application. If that occurs, PHMSA will inform the applicant of the deficiency in writing.

(b) An application, that is not a renewal, party to, or emergency special permit application, and is determined to be complete is docketed. Notice of the application is published in theand an opportunity for public comment is provided. All comments received during the comment period are considered before final action is taken on the application.

(d) During the processing and evaluation of an application, the Associate Administrator may conduct an on-site review or request additional information from the applicant. A failure to cooperate with an on-site review may result in the application being deemed incomplete and subsequently being denied. If the applicant does not respond to a written or electronic request for additional information within 30 days of the date the request was received, the application may be deemed incomplete and denied. However, if the applicant responds in writing or by electronic means within the 30-day period requesting an additional 30 days within which it will gather the requested information, the Associate Administrator may grant the 30-day extension.

(e) The Associate Administrator may grant or deny an application, in whole or in part. In the Associate Administrator's discretion, an application may be granted subject to provisions that are appropriate to protect health, safety or property. The Associate Administrator may impose additional provisions not specified in the application or remove conditions in the application that are unnecessary.

(f) The Associate Administrator may grant an application on finding that-

(2) The application demonstrates that the proposed alternative will achieve a level of safety that:

(i) Is at least equal to that required by the regulation from which the special permit is sought, or

(3) The application states all material facts, and contains no materially false or materially misleading statement;

(4) The applicant meets the qualifications required by applicable regulations; and
