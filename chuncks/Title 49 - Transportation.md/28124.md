######## § 1103.12 The practitioner's duty to and attitude toward the Board.

(a) It is the duty of the practitioner to maintain a respectful attitude toward the Board and for the importance of the functions it administers. In many respects the Board functions as a Court, and practitioners should regard themselves as officers of that Court and uphold its honor and dignity.

(b) It is the right and duty of the practitioner to submit grievances about a member or employee of the Board to the proper authorities when proper grounds for complaint exists. In such cases, charges should be encouraged and the person making them should be protected.

(c) It is the duty of the practitioner to be punctual in attendance, and to be concise and direct in the trial and disposition of causes.
