(1) Legal name, including first, middle, and last; any applicable suffix; and any other name used previously.

(2) Current and previous mailing address, current residential address if it differs from the current mailing address, and e-mail address if available. If the applicant wishes to receive notification that the TWIC is ready to be retrieved from the enrollment center via telephone rather than e-mail address, the applicant should state this and provide the correct telephone number.

(3) Date of birth.

(4) Gender.

(5) Height, weight, hair color, and eye color.

(6) City, state, and country of birth.

(7) Immigration status, and

(i) If the applicant is a naturalized citizen of the United States, the date of naturalization;

(ii) If the applicant is present in the United States based on a Visa, the type of Visa, the Visa number, and the date on which it expires; and

This statement does not limit access to other facilities, vessels, or ports, but establishes eligibility for a TWIC.

(i) Applicants who are commercial drivers licensed in Canada or Mexico who are applying for a TWIC in order to transport hazardous materials in accordance with 49 CFR 1572.201 and not to access secure areas of a facility or vessel, must explain this in response to the information requested in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.

(10) The name, telephone number, and address of the applicant's current employer(s), if working for the employer requires a TWIC. If the applicant's current employer is the U.S. military service, include the branch of the service. An applicant whose current employer does not require possession of a TWIC, does not have a single employer, or is self-employed, must provide the primary vessel or port location(s) where the applicant requires unescorted access, if known. This statement does not limit access to other facilities, vessels, or ports, but establishes eligibility for a TWIC.
