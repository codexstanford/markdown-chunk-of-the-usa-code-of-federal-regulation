###### § 1017.9 Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.
####### The Board as creditor agency.

(a)When the Chief, Section of Financial Services, determines that an employee of another Federal agency owes a delinquent debt to the Board, he/she shall:

(1) Arrange for a hearing upon proper petitioning by the employee;

(2) Certify in writing to the other Federal agency that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt accrued, that the Board's regulations for administrative offset have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management, and that the provisions of 4 CFR 102.3(f) have been fully complied with;

(3) If collection must be made in installments, advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment;

(4) Advise the paying agency of any action taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a);

(5) If the employee is in the process of separating, the Board must submit its debt claim to the paying agency as provided in this part. The paying agency must certify any amounts already collected, notify the employee, and send a copy of the certification and notice of the employee's separation to the creditor agency-if the paying agency is aware that the employee is entitled to money from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, it must certify to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that:

(i) The debtor owes the U.S. a debt, including the amount of that debt;

(ii) The Board has complied with the applicable statutes, regulations, and procedures of OPM; and

(iii) The Board has complied with the requirements of 4 CFR 102.3, including any hearing or review; and

(6) If the employee has already separated and all payments due from the paying agency have been paid, the Chief, Section of Financial Services, may request from OPM, unless otherwise prohibited, that money payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar funds be collected by administrative offset and provide the certification described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
