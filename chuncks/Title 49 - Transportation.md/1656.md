###### § 29.919 When must the Self-Governance Official issue a written decision on the claim?

(a) If the claim is for less than $100,000, the Tribe may request that the Self-Governance Official issue a decision within 60 days of the date of receipt of the claim. If the Tribe does not request that the Self-Governance Official issue a decision within 60 days of the date of receipt of the claim, the Self-Governance Official must issue a decision within a reasonable time, which will depend on the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of the information provided in support of the claim. The Tribe must request a decision by the Self-Governance Official before seeking an appeal in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) If the claim is for more than $100,000, the Self-Governance Official must issue a decision within 60 days of the date of receipt of the claim or notify the Tribe of the time within which the Self-Governance Official will issue a decision. Such time frame must be reasonable, which will depend on the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of the information provided in support of the claim.

(c) If the Self-Governance Official does not issue a decision within these time frames, a Tribe may treat the delay as a denial of its claim and appeal the decision in accordance with § 29.921.
