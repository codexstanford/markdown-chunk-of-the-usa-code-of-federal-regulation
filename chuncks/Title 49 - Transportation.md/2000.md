(c) Good faith efforts shall include at least the following steps:

(1) An initial solicitation for used vehicles specifying that all used vehicles are to be lift-equipped and otherwise accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, or, if an initial solicitation is not used, a documented communication so stating;

(2) A nationwide search for accessible vehicles, involving specific inquiries to used vehicle dealers and other transit providers; and

(3) Advertising in trade publications and contacting trade associations.

(d) Each public entity purchasing or leasing used vehicles that are not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities shall retain documentation of the specific good faith efforts it made for three years from the date the vehicles were purchased. These records shall be made available, on request, to the FTA Administrator and the public.
