For example, a directive can require a person to: stop or reduce production of an item; prohibit the use of selected materials, services, or facilities; or divert the use of materials, services, or facilities from one purpose to another; and

(c) Allotment: An official action that specifies the maximum quantity of a material, service, or facility authorized for a specific use.
