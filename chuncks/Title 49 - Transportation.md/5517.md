(e) Crew and passenger spaces and areas set aside for the crew's use may not be used to stow any hazardous material.

(f) A hazardous material may not be stowed within a horizontal distance of 25 feet of an operating or embarkation point of a lifeboat.

(g) Hazardous materials must be stowed to permit safe access to the crew's quarters and to all parts of the deck required in navigation and necessary working of the vessel.

(h) When runways for use of the crew are built over stowed hazardous materials, they must be constructed and fitted with rails and lifelines so as to afford complete protection to the crew when in use.
