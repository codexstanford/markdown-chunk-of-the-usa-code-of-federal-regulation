###### § 1.30 Assistant Secretaries.

(a) In performing their functions, the Assistant Secretaries are responsible for continuing liaison and coordination among themselves and with the Operating Administrations to:

(1) Avoid unnecessary duplication of effort by or in conflict with the performance of similar activities by the Operating Administrations and the other Assistant Secretaries pursuant to their Secretarial delegations of authority or other legal authorities; and

(2) Assure that the views of the Operating Administrations are considered in developing departmental policies, plans, and proposals. The Assistant Secretaries are also available to assist, as appropriate, the Operating Administrations in implementing departmental policy and programs. As primary staff advisors to the Secretary, the Assistant Secretaries are concerned with transportation matters of the broadest scope, including modal, intermodal, and other matters of Secretarial interest.

(b) There are exceptions to the normal staff role described in paragraph (a) of this section. In selected instances, the Secretary has specifically delegated to Assistant Secretaries authority which they may exercise on the Secretary's behalf.
