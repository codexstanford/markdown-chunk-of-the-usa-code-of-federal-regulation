###### § 572.184 Shoulder assembly.
####### Test procedure.

(b)(1) Soak the dummy assembly, without suit and shoulder foam pad (175-3010), in a test environment as specified in § 572.189(n);

(2) The dummy is seated, as shown in Figure U3 in appendix A to this subpart, on a flat, horizontal, rigid surface covered by two overlaid 2 mm thick Teflon sheets and with no back support of the dummy's torso. The dummy's torso spine backplate is vertical within +/-2 degrees and the midsagittal plane of the thorax is positioned perpendicular to the direction of the plane of motion of the impactor at contact with the shoulder. The arms are oriented forward at 50+/-2 degrees from the horizontal, pointing downward. The dummy's legs are horizontal and symmetrical about the midsaggital plane with the distance between the innermost point on the opposite ankle at 100 +/-5 mm. The length of the elastic shoulder cord (175-3015) shall be adjusted so that a force between and including 27.5 and 32.5 N applied in a forward direction at 4 +/-1 mm from the outer edge of the clavicle in the same plane as the clavicle movement, is required to initiate a forward motion of 1 to 5 mm;

(3) The impactor is the same as defined in § 572.189(a);

(4) The impactor is guided, if needed, so that at contact with the shoulder, its longitudinal axis is within +/-0.5 degrees of a horizontal plane and perpendicular (+/-0.5 degrees) to the midsagittal plane of the dummy and the centerpoint on the impactor's face is within 5 mm of the center of the upper arm pivot bolt (5000040) at contact with the test dummy, as shown in Figure U3 in appendix A to this subpart;

(5) The impactor impacts the dummy's shoulder at 4.3+/-0.1 m/s.
