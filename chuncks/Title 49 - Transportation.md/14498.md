(a) Each railroad subject to this part shall:

(1) Establish and implement an FRMP as part of its SSP; and

(2) Establish an FRA-approved FRMP plan as a component of a railroad's FRA-approved SSP plan and then update its FRMP plan as necessary as part of the annual internal assessment of its SSP under § 270.303.

(b) A railroad's FRMP plan must explain the railroad's method of analysis of fatigue risks and the railroad's process(es) for implementing its FRMP.

(c)(1) A railroad shall submit an FRMP plan to FRA for approval no later than either the applicable timeline in § 270.201(a) for filing its SSP plan or July 13, 2023, whichever is later.

(2) A railroad shall submit updates to its FRMP plan under the process for amending its SSP plan in § 270.201(c).

(d) FRA shall review and approve or disapprove a railroad's FRMP plan and amendments to that plan under the process for reviewing SSP plans and amendments in § 270.201(b) and (c), respectively. FRA approval of a railroad's FRMP plan amends a railroad's SSP plan to include the FRMP plan as a component.
