###### § 520.34 Comments on environmental statements prepared by other agencies.

(a) All requests for NHTSA's views on a DEIS or a proposed action undergoing environmental review by another agency will be transmitted to the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation for action or referral to TES where appropriate. Offices within NHTSA may be requested by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation to supply any pertinent information and comments for a coordinated agency response.

(b) NHTSA's comments and the comments of any offices responding to a request by the Associate Administrator for Planning and Evaluation should be organized in a manner consistent with the structure of an environmental review set out in § 520.21(e). NHTSA programs that are environmentally related to the proposed action under review should be identified so interrelationships may receive due consideration.

(c) Copies of NHTSA's comments on environmental statements prepared by other agencies shall be distributed as follows:

(1) The original and 1 copy to the requesting agency;

(2) 1 copy to TES-70; and
