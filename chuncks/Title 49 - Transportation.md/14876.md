###### § 299.337 Automated vehicle-based inspection systems.

(a) A qualifying Track Geometry Measurement System (TGMS) and a qualifying Track Acceleration Measurement System (TAMS) shall be operated over the route at the following frequency:

(1) For track Class H3, at least twice per calendar year with not less than 120 days between inspections; and

(2) For track Classes H4, H5, H6, and H7, at least twice within any 60-day period with not less than 12 days between inspections.

(b) The qualifying TGMS shall meet or exceed minimum design requirements which specify that-

(1) Track geometry measurements shall be taken no more than 1 meter (3.3 feet) away from the contact point of wheels carrying a vertical load of no less than 4,500 kg (10,000 lb) per wheel;

(2) Track geometry measurements shall be taken and recorded on a distance-based sampling interval not exceeding 0.60 m (2 feet), preferably 0.30 m (1 foot);

(3) Calibration procedures and parameters are assigned to the system which assures that measured and recorded values accurately represent track conditions. Track geometry measurements recorded by the system shall not differ on repeated runs at the same site at the same speed more than 3 mm (inch); and

(4) The TGMS shall be capable of measuring and processing the necessary track geometry parameters to determine compliance with §§ 299.311 and 299.315.

(c) A qualifying TAMS shall be on a vehicle having dynamic response characteristics that are representative of other vehicles assigned to the service and shall-

(1) Be operated at the revenue speed profile in accordance with § 299.309;

(2) Be capable of measuring and processing carbody acceleration parameters to determine compliance with Carbody Acceleration Limits per § 299.313; and

(3) Monitor lateral and vertical accelerations of the carbody. The accelerometers shall be attached to the carbody on or under the floor of the vehicle, as near the center of a bogie as practicable.

(d) The qualifying TGMS and TAMS shall be capable of producing, within 24 hours of the inspection, output reports that-

(1) Provide a continuous plot, on a constant-distance axis, of all measured track geometry and carbody acceleration parameters required in paragraph (b) and (c) of this section;

(2) Provide an exception report containing a systematic listing of all track geometry and all acceleration conditions which constitute an exception to the class of track over the segment surveyed.

(e) The output reports required under paragraph (d) of this section shall contain sufficient location identification information which enables field personnel to easily locate indicated exceptions.

(f) Following a track inspection performed by a qualifying TGMS or TAMS, the railroad shall, institute remedial action for all exceptions to the class of track in accordance with the railroad's inspection, testing, and maintenance program.

(g) The railroad shall maintain for a period of one year following an inspection performed by a qualifying TGMS and TAMS, a copy of the plot and the exception report for the track segment involved, and additional records which-

(1) Specify the date the inspection was made and the track segment involved; and,

(2) Specify the location, remedial action taken, and the date thereof, for all listed exceptions to the class.
