For the purpose of this section, "customer's buried piping" does not include branch lines that serve yard lanterns, pool heaters, or other types of secondary equipment. Also, "maintain" means monitor for corrosion according to § 192.465 if the customer's buried piping is metallic, survey for leaks according to § 192.723, and if an unsafe condition is found, shut off the flow of gas, advise the customer of the need to repair the unsafe condition, or repair the unsafe condition.

(3) Buried gas piping should be-

(i) Periodically inspected for leaks;

(ii) Periodically inspected for corrosion if the piping is metallic; and

(iii) Repaired if any unsafe condition is discovered.

(4) When excavating near buried gas piping, the piping should be located in advance, and the excavation done by hand.

(5) The operator (if applicable), plumbing contractors, and heating contractors can assist in locating, inspecting, and repairing the customer's buried piping.

(c) Each operator shall notify each customer not later than August 14, 1996, or 90 days after the customer first receives gas at a particular location, whichever is later.
