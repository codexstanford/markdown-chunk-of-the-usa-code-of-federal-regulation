### PART 79 - MEDALS OF HONOR
#### § 79.1 Scope.

(a) This part implements 49 U.S.C. 80504, which authorizes the President of the United States to award a bronze medal for bravery to any person who, by extreme daring, risks his/her life in trying to prevent, or to save the life of a person in, a grave accident/incident in the United States that involves an interstate rail carrier or a motor vehicle being operated on public highways.

(b) The actions for which the medal may be awarded must reflect such unusual daring and bravery that a person would not normally be expected to perform them as a regular part of his/her regular work or vocation.
