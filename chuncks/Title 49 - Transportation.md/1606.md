###### § 29.519 How may a Tribe use existing Department facilities, equipment, or property?

At the request of a Tribe, the Department will permit the Tribe to use and maintain existing facilities, equipment therein or appertaining thereto, and other personal property, if applicable, owned by the Government within the Department's jurisdiction, subject to terms and conditions agreed to by the Department and the Tribe. The requested facilities, equipment, or property must be used to carry out the Tribe's PSFAs under the compact and funding agreement. Such facilities, equipment, or other personal property will be eligible for replacement, maintenance, and improvement using funds included in a funding agreement, or the Tribe may expend its own funds. The Department does not have any additional funding sources for replacement, maintenance, or improvement of such facilities, equipment, other personal property. The Department will exercise discretion in a way that gives the maximum effect to the request of the Tribe to use such facilities, equipment, or property.
