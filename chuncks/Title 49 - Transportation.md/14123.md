Simultaneously, one copy of the application and supporting papers shall be filed with the Secretary of the Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC. Each copy shall bear the dates and signatures that appear in the original and shall be complete in itself, but the signatures in the copies may be stamped or typed. If unusual difficulties arise in the furnishing of any of the exhibits required in § 250.2, the carrier applicant or the lender, upon appropriate showing and with the consent of the Administrator, may file a lesser number.
