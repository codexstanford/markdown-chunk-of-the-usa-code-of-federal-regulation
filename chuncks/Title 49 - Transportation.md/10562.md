##### § 224.105 Sheeting dimensions and quantity.

Retroreflective sheeting shall be applied along the length of each railroad freight car and locomotive side as described in § 224.106. Unless otherwise specified, retroreflective sheeting applied under this part shall be applied in strips 4 inches wide and 18 or 36 inches long, as practicable. The amount of retroreflective sheeting to be applied to each car or locomotive subject to this part is dependent on the length of the car or locomotive and the color of the sheeting. For purposes of this part, the length of a railroad freight car or locomotive is measured from endsill to endsill, exclusive of the coupler and draft gear. Each side of a railroad freight car subject to this part, including each unit of multi-unit cars, and each side of a locomotive subject to this part must be equipped with at least the minimum amount of retroreflective sheeting specified in Table 2 of this subpart.
