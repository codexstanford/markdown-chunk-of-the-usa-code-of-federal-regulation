###### § 1007.12 Exemptions.
####### Provided, however,

(a) Investigatory materials compiled for law enforcement purposes are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules on the basis and to the extent that individual access to these files could impair the effectiveness and orderly conduct of the Board's enforcement program.That if any individual is denied any right, privilege, or benefit to which he or she would otherwise be entitled by Federal law, or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible, as a result of the maintenance of such material, such materials shall be provided to the individual; except to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to the effective date of this section, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.

(b) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment with or contracts with the Board are exempt from portions of the Privacy Act of 1974 and of these rules to the extent that it identifies a confidential source. This is done in order to encourage persons from whom information is sought to provide information to the Board which, absent assurances of confidentiality, they might otherwise be unwilling to give. However, if practicable, material identifying a confidential source shall be extracted or summarized in a manner which protects the source, and the summary or extract shall be provided to the requesting individual.

(c) Complaints and investigatory materials compiled by the Board's Office of Inspector General are exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a and the regulations in this part, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), except subsections (b), (c)(1) and (2), (e)(4)(A) through (F), (e)(6), (7), (9), (10), and (11) and (i) to the extent that the system of records pertains to the enforcement of criminal laws. Complaint and investigatory materials compiled by the Board's Office of Inspector General for law enforcement purposes also are exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a and the regulations of this part, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2).
