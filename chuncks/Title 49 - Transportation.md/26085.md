## Subtitle B - Other Regulations Relating to Transportation
### Chapter V - National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Transportation
#### PART 591 - IMPORTATION OF VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT SUBJECT TO FEDERAL SAFETY, BUMPER AND THEFT PREVENTION STANDARDS
##### § 591.7 Restrictions on importations.

(a) A vehicle or equipment item which has entered the United States under a declaration made pursuant to § 591.5(j), and for which a Temporary Importation Bond has been provided to the Secretary of the Treasury, shall not remain in the United States for a period that exceeds 3 years from its date of entry.

(b) If the importer of a vehicle or equipment item under § 591.5(j) does not intend to export or destroy the vehicle or equipment item not later than 3 years after the date of entry, and intends to pay duty to the U.S. Customs Service on such vehicle or equipment item, the importer shall request permission in writing from the Administrator for the vehicle or equipment item to remain in the United States for an additional period of time not to exceed 5 years from the date of entry. Such a request must be received not later than 60 days before the date that is 3 years after the date of entry. Such vehicle or equipment item shall not remain in the United States for a period that exceeds 5 years from the date of entry, unless further written permission has been obtained from the Administrator.

(c) An importer of a vehicle which has entered the United States under a declaration made pursuant to § 591.5(j)(2)(i) shall not sell, or transfer possession of, or title to, the vehicle, and shall not license it for use, or operate it on the public roads, except under such terms and conditions as the Administrator may authorize in writing. An importer of a vehicle which has entered the United States under a declaration made pursuant to § 591.5(j)(2)(ii) shall at all times retain title to it.

(d) Any violation of a term or condition imposed by the Administrator in a letter authorizing importation for on-road use under § 591.5(j), or a change of status under paragraph (e) of this section, including a failure to allow inspection upon request to verify that the accumulated mileage of the vehicle is not more than 2,500 miles in any 12-month period, shall be considered a violation of 49 U.S.C. 30112(a) for which a civil penalty may be imposed. Such a violation will also act to void the authorization and require the exportation of the vehicle. With respect to importations under § 591.6(f)(2) or a change of status to an importation for show or display as provided under paragraph (e) of this section, if the Administrator has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, the Administrator may tentatively conclude that a term of entry has been violated, but shall make no final conclusion until the importer or owner has been afforded an opportunity to present data, views, and arguments as to why there is no violation or why a penalty should not be imposed.

(e) If the importer of a vehicle under § 591.5(f)(2)(ii) has been notified in writing by the Registered Importer with which it has executed a contract or other agreement that the registration of the Registered Importer has been suspended (for other than the first time) or revoked, pursuant to § 592.7 of this chapter, and that it has not affixed a certification label on the vehicle and/or filed a certification of conformance with the Administrator as required by § 592.6 of this chapter, and that it therefore may not release the vehicle for the importer, the importer shall execute a contract or other agreement with another Registered Importer for the certification of the vehicle and submission of the certification of conformance to the Administrator. The Administrator shall toll the 120-day period for submission of a certification to the Administrator pursuant to § 592.6(d) of this chapter during the period from the date of the Registered Importer's notification to the importer until the date of the contract with the substitute Registered Importer.

(f) If a vehicle has entered the United States under a declaration made pursuant to § 591.5(l) and:

(1) If the Administrator of NHTSA dismisses the petition or decides that the vehicle is not eligible for importation, or if the importer withdraws the petition or fails to submit a petition covering the vehicle within 180 days from the date of entry, the importer must deliver the vehicle, unless it is destroyed (with destruction documented by proof), to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export, or abandon the vehicle to the United States, within 30 days from the date of the dismissal, denial, or withdrawal of the importer's petition, as appropriate, or within 210 days from the date of entry if the importer fails to submit a petition covering the vehicle, and furnish NHTSA with documentary proof of the vehicle's exportation, abandonment, or destruction within 15 days from the date of such action; or

(2) If the Administrator grants the petition, the importer must:

(i) Furnish a bond, in an amount equal to 150 percent of the entered value of the vehicle as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, within 15 days from the date the importer is notified that the petition has been granted, unless the vehicle has been destroyed, and bring the vehicle into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards within 120 days from the date the petition is granted; or,

(ii) Deliver the vehicle to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export within 30 days from the date the importer is notified that the petition has been granted; or

(iii) Abandon the vehicle to the United States within 30 days from the date the importer is notified that the petition has been granted; or

(iv) Destroy the vehicle within 30 days from the date the importer is notified that the petition has been granted; and

(v) Furnish NHTSA with documentary proof of the vehicle's exportation, abandonment, or destruction within 15 days from the date of such action.
