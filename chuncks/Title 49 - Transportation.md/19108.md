Any motion must set forth the grounds and theories of why and how the party believes the process should be modified, limited, or quashed and must contain all facts and arguments which support those grounds and theories.

(i) Deny the motion;

(ii) Modify the return date of the subpoena;

(iii) Modify, limit or quash the subpoena;

(iv) Condition granting the motion upon certain requirements; or

(v) Take any other action he or she believes to be appropriate in the circumstances.

(3) The Office of the Deputy Administrator serves the decision on the motion on the moving party or the counsel or representative of the moving party. This service may be made by personal service, by registered or certified mail, or by reading a copy of the decision to the moving party or the counsel or representative of the moving party.

(4) A denial of any motion properly filed under this section shall be in writing, and shall contain a brief statement of the facts involved and the conclusions drawn from those facts by the Deputy Administrator.
