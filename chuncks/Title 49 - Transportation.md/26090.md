Know All Men by These Presents That (principal's name, mailing address which includes city, state, ZIP code, and state of incorporation if a corporation), as principal, and (surety's name, mailing address which includes city, state, ZIP code and state of incorporation) as surety, are held and firmly bound unto the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA in the sum of (bond amount in words) dollars ($ (bond amount in numbers)), which represents 150% of the entered value of the following described motor vehicle, as determined by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (make, model, model year, and VIN of each vehicle) for the payment of which we bind ourselves, our heirs, executors, and assigns (jointly and severally), firmly bound by these presents.

(1) The above-bounden principal ("the principal"), in consideration of the permanent admission into the United States of the motor vehicles described above, voluntarily undertakes and agrees to have such vehicles brought into conformity with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards within a reasonable time after such importation, as specified by the Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the "Administrator");

(2) For each vehicle described above ("such vehicle"), the principal shall then file, with the Administrator, a certificate that such vehicle complies with each Federal motor vehicle safety standard in the year that such vehicle was manufactured and which applies in such year to such vehicle, and that such vehicle complies with the Federal bumper standard (if applicable);

(3) The principal shall not release custody of any vehicle to any person, or license or register the vehicle, from the date of entry until 30 calendar days after it has certified compliance of such vehicle to the Administrator, unless the Administrator notifies the principal before 30 days that (s)he has accepted such certification and such vehicle and all liability under this bond for such vehicle may be released, except that no such release shall be permitted, before or after the 30th calendar day, if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that an inspection of such vehicle will be required, or that there is reason to believe that such certification is false or contains a misrepresentation.

(4) And if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that an inspection of such vehicle is required, the principal shall cause such vehicle to be available for inspection, and such vehicle and all liability under this bond for such vehicle shall be promptly released after completion of an inspection showing no failure to comply. However, if the inspection shows a failure to comply, such vehicle and all liability under this bond for such vehicle shall not be released until such time as the failure to comply ceases to exist;

(5) And if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that there is reason to believe that such certificate is false or contains a misrepresentation, such vehicle and all liability under this bond for such vehicle shall not be released until the Administrator is satisfied with such certification and any modification thereof;

(6) And if the principal has received written notice from the Administrator that such vehicle has been found not to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety and bumper standards, and written demand that such vehicle be abandoned to the United States, or delivered to the Secretary of Homeland Security for export (at no cost to the United States), the principal shall abandon such vehicle to the United States, or shall deliver such vehicle, or cause such vehicle to be delivered to, the custody of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection at the port of entry listed above, or any other port of entry, and shall execute all documents necessary for exportation of such vehicle from the United States, at no cost to the United States; or in default of abandonment or redelivery after proper notice by the Administrator to the principal, the principal shall pay to the Administrator an amount equal to 150% of the entered value of such vehicle as determined by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection;

Then this obligation shall be void; otherwise it shall remain in full force and effect. [At this point the terms agreed upon between the principal and surety for termination of the obligation may be entered]
