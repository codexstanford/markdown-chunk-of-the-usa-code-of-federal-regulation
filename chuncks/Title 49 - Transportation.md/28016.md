###### § 1019.5 Sexual harassment.

(a) Members and employees shall not engage in harassment on the basis of sex. Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when:

(1) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;

(2) Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or

(3) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, offensive, or unpleasant working environment.

(b) Employees and applicants may follow the standard Equal Employment Opportunity Board complaint process if they believe they have a work-related sexual harassment problem. This requires that the employee or applicant contact an EEO Counselor within 45 days of the alleged harassment or, if a personnel action is involved, within 45 days of its effective date.

(c) The regulations in this section apply also to harassment based on race, color, religion, or national origin.
