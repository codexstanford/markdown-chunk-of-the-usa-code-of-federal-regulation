##### PART 1017 - DEBT COLLECTION - COLLECTION BY OFFSET FROM INDEBTED GOVERNMENT AND FORMER GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
###### § 1017.6 Result if employee fails to meet deadlines.

An employee will not be granted a hearing and will have his/her disposable pay offset in accordance with the Board's offset schedule if the employee:

(a) Fails to file a petition for a hearing in conformity with the requirements of § 1017.4(b)(8) or § 1017.4(c)(9) of this part, whichever is applicable. However, failure to file within the requisite time period set out in § 1017.4(b)(8) or § 1017.4(c)(9) of this part whichever is applicable, will not result in denial of a hearing or in immediate offset, if the Administrative Law Judge excuses the late filing if the employee can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his/her control or because of failure to receive notice of the filing deadline.

(b) Is scheduled to appear and fails to appear at the hearing without good cause.
