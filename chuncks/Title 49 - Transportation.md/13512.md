###### § 238.317 Class II brake test.

(a) A Class II brake test shall be performed on a passenger train when any of the following events occurs:

(1) Whenever the control stand used to control the train is changed; except if the control stand is changed to facilitate the movement of a passenger train from one track to another within a terminal complex while not in passenger service. In these circumstances, a Class II brake test shall be performed prior to the train's departure from the terminal complex with passengers;

(2) Prior to the first morning departure of each commuter or short-distance intercity passenger train where a Class I brake test remains valid as provided in § 238.315(a)(1);

(3) When previously tested units (i.e., cars that received a Class I brake test within the previous calendar day and have not been disconnected from a source of compressed air for more than four hours) are added to the train;

(4) When cars or equipment are removed from the train; and

(5) When an operator first takes charge of the train, except for face-to-face relief.

(b) A Class II brake test shall be performed by a qualified person or a qualified maintenance person.

(c) Except as provided in § 238.15, a railroad shall not use or haul a passenger train in passenger service from a terminal or yard where a Class II brake test has been performed, or was required by this part to have been performed, with any of the brakes cut-out, inoperative, or defective.

(d) In performing a Class II brake test on a train, a railroad shall determine that:

(1) The brakes on the rear unit of the train apply and release in response to a signal from the engineer's brake valve or controller of the leading or controlling unit, or a gauge or similar device located at the rear of the train or in the cab of the rear unit indicates that brake pipe pressure changes are properly communicated at the rear of the train;

(2) For MU locomotives that utilize an electric signal to communicate a service brake application and only a pneumatic signal to propagate an emergency brake application, the emergency brake application functions as intended.

(3) The communicating signal system is tested and known to be operating as intended; a tested and operating two-way radio system meets this requirement.
