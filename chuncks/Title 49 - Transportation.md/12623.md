####### § 236.203 Hand operated crossover between main tracks; protection.

At hand-operated crossover between main tracks, protection shall be provided by one of the following:

(a) An arrangement of one or more track circuits and switch circuit controllers,

(b) Facing point locks on both switches of the crossover, with both locks operated by a single lever, or

(c) Electric locking of the switches of the crossover. Signals governing movements over either switch shall display their most restrictive aspect when any of the following conditions exist:

(1) Where protection is provided by one or more track circuits and switch circuit controllers, and either switch is open or the crossover is occupied by a train, locomotive or car in such a manner as to foul the main track. It shall not be a violation of this requirement where the presence of sand, rust, dirt, grease or other foreign matter on the rail prevents effective shunting;

(2) Where facing point locks with a single lever are provided, and either switch is unlocked;

(3) Where the switches are electrically locked, before the electric locking releases.
