####### § 176.805 On deck stowage.

When break bulk Class 8 (corrosive materials) materials being transported on a vessel are stowed on deck:

(a) Provisions must be made for leakage from any package to drain away from other cargo into an overboard scupper or freeing port. The drainage may not enter an enclosed drainage system other than a direct overboard scupper. If this stowage is not practical, sufficient clean dry sand must be placed under and around the lower tier of packages to absorb any leakage.

(b) Dunnage must be provided on the deck and arranged so that any leakage will be apparent.

(c) Any leakage that occurs must be washed down, using liberal quantities of water.
