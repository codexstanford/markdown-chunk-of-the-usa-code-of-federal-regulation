The examiner shall grant any delays or continuances that the examiner determines to be necessary and appropriate for fair resolution of the case, with due regard to the former employee's need for adequate time to prepare a defense and for expeditious resolution of allegations that may be damaging to that former employee's reputation.

(1) To represent oneself or to be represented by counsel.

(2) To introduce and examine witnesses and to submit physical evidence.

(3) To confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.

(4) To present oral argument.

(5) To obtain a transcript or recording of the hearing on request from the official reporter upon payment of the fees fixed therefor.
