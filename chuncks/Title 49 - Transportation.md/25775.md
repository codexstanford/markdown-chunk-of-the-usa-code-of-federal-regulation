##### § 580.14 Power of attorney to review title documents and acknowledge disclosure.

(a) In circumstances where part A of a physical power of attorney form has been used pursuant to § 580.13 of this part, and if otherwise permitted by the law of the jurisdiction, a transferee may grant power of attorney to their transferor to review the physical or electronic title and any physical reassignment documents, if applicable, for mileage discrepancies, and if no discrepancies are found, to acknowledge disclosure on the physical or electronic title. The power of attorney shall be on part B of the physical or electronic power of attorney referred to in § 580.13(a), which shall contain a space for the information required to be disclosed under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section and, in part C, a space for the certification required to be made under § 580.15.

(b) Part B of the physical or electronic power of attorney must include a mileage disclosure from the transferor to the transferee and must be signed by the transferor, including the printed name, and contain the following information:

(1) The odometer reading at the time of transfer (not to include tenths of miles);

(2) The date of transfer;

(3) The transferor's printed name and current address;

(4) The transferee's printed name and current address; and

(5) The identity of the vehicle, including its make, model, year, body type, and vehicle identification number.

(c) In addition to the information provided under paragraph (b) of this section, the power of attorney form shall refer to the federal odometer law and state that providing false information or the failure of the person granted the power of attorney to submit the form to the State may result in fines and/or imprisonment. Reference may also be made to applicable law of the jurisdiction.

(d) In addition to the information provided under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:

(1) The transferor shall certify that to the best of their knowledge the odometer reading reflects the actual mileage; or

(2) If the transferor knows that the odometer reading reflects mileage in excess of the designed mechanical odometer limit, they shall include a statement to that the mileage exceeds mechanical limits; or

(3) If the transferor knows that the odometer reading differs from the mileage and the difference is greater than that caused by a calibration error or does not reflect a valid mileage display, they shall include a statement that the odometer reading does not reflect the actual mileage and should not be relied upon. This statement shall also include a warning notice to alert the transferee that a discrepancy exists between the odometer reading and the actual mileage.

(e) The transferee shall sign the physical or electronic power of attorney form, which shall include their printed name.

(f) The transferor shall give a copy of the physical power of attorney form to their transferee.
