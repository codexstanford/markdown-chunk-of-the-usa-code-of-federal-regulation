#### PART 850 - COAST GUARD - NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD MARINE CASUALTY INVESTIGATIONS
##### § 850.3 Relationship to Coast Guard marine investigation regulations and procedures.

(a) The Coast Guard's responsibility to investigate marine casualties is not eliminated nor diminished by the regulations in this part.
