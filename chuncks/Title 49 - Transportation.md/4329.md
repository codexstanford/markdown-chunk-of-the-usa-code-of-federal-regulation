(iv) Contains only the residue of-

(A) A limited quantity material; or

(B) A Division 2.2 non-flammable gas, other than ammonia, anhydrous, and with no subsidiary hazard, at a gauge pressure less than 200 kPa (29.0 psig); at 20 &#xB0;C (68 &#xB0;F); and

(3) Any material contained in the packaging does not meet the definitions in § 171.8 of this subchapter for a hazardous substance, a hazardous waste, or a marine pollutant.

(ii) A UN specification 4G fiberboard box or non-specification fiberboard box containing plastic receptacle inner packagings with not more than 2.5 grams of smokeless powders in each inner packaging;

(2) The amount of smokeless powder per outer packaging does not exceed 5 grams;

(3) The smokeless powder is approved in accordance with § 173.56 as a Class 1 explosive material;
