The procedures for obtaining an exception covered by 49 U.S.C. 5323(j)(2)(C) are set forth in § 661.11 of this part.

(b) A bidder or offeror who seeks to establish grounds for an exception must seek the exception, in a timely manner, through the grantee.

(d) FTA will consider a request for a waiver from a potential bidder, offeror, or supplier only if the waiver is being sought under § 661.7 (f) or (g) of this part.

(e) The Administrator will issue a written determination setting forth the reasons for granting or denying the exception request. Each request for an exception, and FTA's action on the request, are available for public inspection under the provisions of 49 CFR part 601, subpart C.
