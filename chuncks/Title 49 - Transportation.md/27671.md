###### § 831.52 Responsibility of NTSB in marine investigations.

(a) The NTSB may conduct an investigation of a major marine casualty or a marine casualty of a vessel (including, but not limited to, allisions, abandonments, and accidents) alone or jointly with the USCG pursuant to the joint regulations in part 850 of this chapter.

(b) Nothing in this part may be construed to conflict with the regulations in part 850 of this chapter, which were prescribed jointly by the NTSB and USCG under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 1131(a)(1)(E).

(c) In an investigation led by the USCG, the NTSB may perform separate activities in furtherance of its own analysis or at the request of the USCG. The NTSB and USCG will coordinate to ensure the agencies do not duplicate work or hinder the progress of the investigation.

(d) Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 1131(a)(1)(F), the NTSB is responsible for the investigation of other accidents that may include marine and boating accidents not covered by part 850 of this chapter, and certain accidents involving transportation and/or release of hazardous materials.
