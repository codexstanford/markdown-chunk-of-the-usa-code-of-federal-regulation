The following paragraph specifies which projects will be subject to the cost recovery requirements of this section.

(a) This section applies to any project that-

The good faith estimate for design and construction costs must include all of the applicable cost items contained in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission application referenced in § 190.403(a)(1)(i) for a gas or LNG facility. In addition, an applicant must take into account all survey, design, material, permitting, right-of way acquisition, construction, testing, commissioning, start-up, construction financing, environmental protection, inspection, material transportation, sales tax, project contingency, and all other applicable costs, including all segments, facilities, and multi-year phases of the project;

(2) Uses new or novel technologies or design, as defined in § 190.3.

(b) The Associate Administrator may not collect design safety review fees under this section and 49 U.S.C. 60301 for the same design safety review.

The Associate Administrator's determination is based on the amount of PHMSA resources needed to ensure safety and environmental protection.
