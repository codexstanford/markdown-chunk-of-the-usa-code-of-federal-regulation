####### § 173.433 Requirements for determining basic radionuclide values, and for the listing of radionuclides on shipping papers and labels.

(a) For individual radionuclides listed in the table in § 173.435 and § 173.436:

(1) Aand Avalues are given in the table in § 173.435; and

(2) Activity concentration exemption values and consignment activity exemption values are given in the table in § 173.436.

(b) For individual radionuclides which are not listed in the tables in § 173.435 or § 173.436 or for which no relevant data are available:

(1) the radionuclide values in Tables 7 or 8 of this section may be used; or

(2) other basic radionuclide values may be used provided they are first approved by the Associate Administrator or, for international transport, multilateral approval is obtained from the pertinent Competent Authorities.

(c) In calculating A1 and Avalues for approval in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section:

(1) It is permissible to use an Avalue calculated using a dose coefficient for the appropriate lung absorption type, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, if the chemical forms of each radionuclide under both normal and accident conditions of transport are taken into consideration.

(2) A single radioactive decay chain in which the radionuclides are present in their naturally-occurring proportions, and in which no daughter nuclide has a half life either longer than 10 days or longer than that of the parent nuclide, will be considered as a single radionuclide, and the activity to be taken into account and the Aor Avalue to be applied will be those corresponding to the parent nuclide of that chain. Otherwise, the parent and daughter nuclides will be considered as a mixture of different nuclides.

(d) Mixtures of radionuclides whose identities and respective activities are known must conform to the following conditions:

(1) For special form Class 7 (radioactive) material, the activity which may be transported in a Type A package must satisfy:

(2) For normal form Class 7 (radioactive) material, the activity which may be transported in a Type A package must satisfy:

(3) If the package contains both special and normal form Class 7 (radioactive) material, the activity which may be transported in a Type A package must satisfy:

(4) Alternatively, the Avalue for a mixture of special form material may be determined as follows:

(5) Alternatively, the Avalue for mixtures of normal form material may be determined as follows:

(6) The exempt activity concentration for mixtures of nuclides may be determined as follows:

(7) The activity limit for an exempt consignment for mixtures of nuclides may be determined as follows:

(e) When the identity of each nuclide is known but the individual activities of some of the radionuclides are not known, the radionuclides may be grouped and the lowest Aor Avalue, as appropriate, for the radionuclides in each group may be used in applying the formulas in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section. Groups may be based on the total alpha activity and the total beta/gamma activity when these are known, using the lowest Aor Avalues for the alpha emitters or beta/gamma emitters, respectively.

(f) When the identity of each nuclide is known but the individual activities of some of the radionuclides are not known, the radionuclides may be grouped and the lowest [A] (activity concentration for exempt material) or A (activity limit for exempt consignment) value, as appropriate, for the radionuclides in each group may be used in applying the formulas in paragraphs (d)(6) and (d)(7) of this section. Groups may be based on the total alpha activity and the total beta/gamma activity when these are known, using the lowest [A] or A values for the alpha emitters or beta/gamma emitters, respectively.
