(2) The jeopardy arises out of a failure to carry out the compact or funding agreement.

(b) The Department must provide notice of immediate termination by any method that provides receipt. The notice must set forth the findings that support the Department's determination, advise the Tribe whether it will be reimbursed for any closeout costs incurred after the termination, request the return of any property, and advise the Tribe of its right to a hearing pursuant to § 29.925.
