###### § 218.39 Hump operations.

After June 30, 1984, each railroad that operates a remote control hump yard facility must have in effect an operating rule that adopts the following provisions in substance:

(a) When a train or engine service employee is required to couple an air hose or to adjust a coupling device and that activity will require that the employee place himself between pieces of rolling equipment located on a bowl track, the operator of any remotely controlled switch that provides access from the apex of the hump to the track on which the rolling equipment is located shall be notified;

(b) Upon such notification, the operator of such remotely controlled switch shall line it against movement to the affected bowl track and shall apply a locking or blocking device to the control for that switch; and

(c) The operator shall then notify the employee that the requested protection has been provided and shall remove the locking or blocking device only after being notified by the employee that protection is no longer required on that track.
