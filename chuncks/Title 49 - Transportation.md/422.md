### PART 15 - PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE SECURITY INFORMATION
#### § 15.1 Scope.
##### Applicability.

(a)This part governs the maintenance, safeguarding, and disclosure of records and information that the Secretary of DOT has determined to be Sensitive Security Information, as defined in § 15.5. This part does not apply to the maintenance, safeguarding, or disclosure of classified national security information, as defined by Executive Order 12968, or to other sensitive unclassified information that is not SSI, but that nonetheless may be exempt from public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, in the case of information that has been designated as critical infrastructure information under section 214 of the Homeland Security Act, the receipt, maintenance, or disclosure of such information by a Federal agency or employee is governed by section 214 and any implementing regulations, not by this part.
