####### § 236.14 Spring switch signal protection; requirements.

(a) The indication of signal governing movements from siding to main track with the current of traffic on track signaled for movements in only one direction through a spring switch in automatic block signal territory shall be not less restrictive than "Proceed at Restricted Speed' when the block, into which movements are governed by the signal, is occupied, and shall be "Stop" when the main track is occupied by a train approaching the switch within at least 1,500 feet in approach of the approach signal located stopping distance from the main track signal governing trailing movements over switch, except that the indication may be caused to be less restrictive if approach or time locking is used.

(b) The indication of signal governing movements against the current of traffic from the reverse main of main tracks to a single track, or signal governing movements from a siding to a main track signaled for movements in either direction, through a spring switch, in automatic block signal territory, shall be not less restrictive than "Proceed at Restricted Speed" when the block, into which movements are governed by the signal, is occupied by a preceding train, and shall be "Stop" when the block on the single track into which the signal governs is occupied by an opposing train.

(c) The indication of signal governing movements against the current of traffic from the reverse main of main tracks to a single track or signal governing movements from a siding to a main track signaled for movements in either direction through a spring switch in automatic block signal territory shall be "Stop" when the normal direction main track of the double track or the single track signaled for movements in both directions is occupied by a train approaching the switch within at least 1,500 feet in approach of the approach signal located stopping distance from the main track signal governing trailing movements over switch, except that indication may be caused to be less restrictive if approach or time locking is used.
