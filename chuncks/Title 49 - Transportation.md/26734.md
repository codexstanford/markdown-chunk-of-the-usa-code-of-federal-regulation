## Subtitle B - Other Regulations Relating to Transportation
### Chapter VI - Federal Transit Administration, Department of Transportation
#### PART 633 - PROJECT MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT
##### Subpart B - Project Management Oversight Services
###### § 633.19 Exclusion from the project management oversight program.

The Administrator may, in compelling circumstances, determine that a project meeting the criteria of § 633.5(e)(1) is not a major capital project because project management oversight under this part will not benefit the Federal government or the recipient. Typically, this means a project that:

(a) Involves a recipient whose past record indicates the appropriateness of excluding the project from project management oversight under this part; and

(b) Involves such a greater level of financial risk to the recipient than to the Federal government that project management oversight under this part is made less necessary to secure the recipient's diligence.
