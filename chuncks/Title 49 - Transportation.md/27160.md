###### Frequently requested information.

(b)The FOIA requires that copies of records, regardless of form or format, that have been released pursuant to a FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) be made publicly available in an electronic format if because of the nature of their subject matter they have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records or they have been requested three or more times.

(1) Amtrak shall decide on a case-by-case basis whether records fall into the first category of "frequently requested FOIA records" based on the following factors:

(i) Previous experience with similar records;

(ii) The nature and type of information contained in the records;

(iii) The identity and number of requesters and whether there is widespread media or commercial interest in the records.
