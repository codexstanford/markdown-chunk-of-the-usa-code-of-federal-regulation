(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, when Class 1 (explosive) materials (other than explosive articles in Division 1.4 [explosive] or any explosive substance) are loaded, unloaded, or handled, the responsible person must ensure that all sources of electromagnetic radiation such as radio and radar transmitters are deenergized by opening the main switches controlling the sources and tagging them to warn that the devices are not to be energized until loading or unloading has ceased.

(b) During the loading or unloading of all explosive articles (except those in Division 1.4 [explosive]), no radio or radar transmitter may be used within 50 m (164 feet) of such articles except for VHF transmitters the power output of which does not exceed 25 watts and of which no part of the antenna system is within 2 m (7 feet) of the Class 1 (explosive) materials.

(c) Explosive articles which are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation from external sources must be stowed at a safe distance from the vessel's radio cabin, receiving and transmitting apparatus radio antenna or lead-in, and radar installation, with due regard to the character of the vessel and the degree of screening-off of the explosive articles.
