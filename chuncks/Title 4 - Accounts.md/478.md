(4) The establishment of procedures to be followed by the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) when responding to requests pertaining to separated employees in any of the following circumstances:

(a) When the OPF contains documentation resulting from employment in both systems;

(b) When a request is received for transfer of an OPF between systems;
