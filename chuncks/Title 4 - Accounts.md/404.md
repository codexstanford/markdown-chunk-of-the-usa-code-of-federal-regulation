##### Subpart I - Ex Parte Communications
###### § 28.146 Explanation and definitions.

(a) Ex parte communications are oral or written communications between decision-making personnel of the Board and an interested party to a proceeding without providing the other parties to the proceeding a chance to participate. The only ex parte communications that are prohibited are those that involve the merits of the case or those that violate other rules requiring submissions to be in writing. Accordingly, interested parties may make inquiries about such matters as the status of a case, when it will be heard, and the method for transmitting evidence to the Board. Such communications should be directed to the Clerk of the Board. Parties may not inquire about such matters as what defense they should use or whether their evidence is adequate, make a submission orally which is required to be in writing, or otherwise inquire as to the merits of a pending case.

(b) In this subpart-

(1) "Interested party" includes:

(i) Any party, including the General Counsel of the Board, or representative of a party involved in a proceeding before the Board;

(ii) Any person desiring to intervene in any proceeding before the Board; or

(iii) Any other person who might be affected by the outcome of a proceeding before the Board.

(2) "Decision-making personnel" means the Board, a panel of Board members, a Board member, an administrative judge, and/or an employee of the Board, who reasonably can be expected to participate in the decision-making process of the Board.
