#### PART 83 - PRIVACY PROCEDURES FOR PERSONNEL RECORDS
##### § 83.1 Purpose and scope of part.

This part describes the policy and prescribes the procedures of the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) with respect to maintaining and protecting the privacy of GAO personnel records. While GAO is not subject to the Privacy Act (Act) (5 U.S.C. 552a), GAO's policy is to conduct its activities in a manner that is consistent with the spirit of the Act and its duties, functions, and responsibilities to the Congress. Application of the Privacy Act to GAO is not to be inferred from the provisions of these regulations. These regulations are designed to safeguard individuals against invasions of personal privacy by requiring GAO, except as otherwise provided by law, to-

(a) Protect privacy interests of individuals by imposing requirements of accuracy, relevance, and confidentiality for the maintenance and disclosure of personnel records;

(b) Inform individuals of the existence of systems of personnel records maintained by GAO containing personal information; and

(c) Inform individuals of the right to see and challenge the contents of personnel records containing information about them.
