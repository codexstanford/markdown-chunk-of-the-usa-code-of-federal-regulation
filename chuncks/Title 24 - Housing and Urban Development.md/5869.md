########***.*** ######### § 206.57 Cure provision enabling reinstatement of Deferral Period

(a) When the mortgagee is required by § 206.55(b)(2) to provide an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse with 30 days to cure the default, this section shall apply.

(b) If the default is cured within the 30-day timeframe, the Deferral Period shall be reinstated, unless:

(1) The mortgagee has reinstated the Deferral Period within the past two years immediately preceding the current notification to the Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse that the mortgage is due and payable;

(2) The reinstatement of the Deferral Period will preclude foreclosure if the mortgage becomes due and payable at a later date; or

(3) The reinstatement of the Deferral Period will adversely affect the priority of the mortgage lien.

(c) If the default is not cured within the 30-day timeframe, the mortgagee shall proceed in accordance with the established timeframes to initiate foreclosure and reasonable diligence in prosecuting foreclosure.

(d) Even after a foreclosure proceeding has been initiated, the mortgagee shall permit an Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse to cure the condition which resulted in the Deferral Period ceasing, consistent with § 206.55(b)(2), and to reinstate the mortgage and Deferral Period, and the mortgage insurance shall continue in effect. The mortgagee may require the Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse to pay any costs that the mortgagee incurred to reinstate the mortgage, including foreclosure costs and reasonable attorney's fees. Such costs may not be added to the outstanding loan balance and shall be paid from some other source of funds. The mortgagee shall reinstate the Deferral Period unless:

(1) The mortgagee has reinstated the Deferral Period within the past two years immediately preceding the latest notification to the Eligible Non-Borrowing Spouse that the mortgage is due and payable;

(2) The reinstatement of the Deferral Period will preclude foreclosure if the mortgage becomes due and payable at a later date; or

(3) The reinstatement of the Deferral Period will adversely affect the priority of the mortgage lien.
