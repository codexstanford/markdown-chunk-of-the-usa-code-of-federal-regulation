###### § 1003.504 Use of real property.

The standards described in this section apply to real property within the grantee's control which was acquired or improved in whole or in part using ICDBG funds in excess of $25,000. These standards shall apply from the date ICDBG funds are first spent for the property until five years after the closeout of the grant from which the assistance to the property was provided.

(a) A grantee may not change the use or planned use of any such property (including the beneficiaries of such use) from that for which the acquisition or improvement was made unless the grantee provides affected citizens with reasonable notice of, and opportunity to comment on, any proposed change, and either:

(1) The new use of such property qualifies as meeting the primary objective set forth in § 1003.208 and is not a building for the general conduct of government; or

(2) The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section are met.

(b) If the grantee determines, after consultation with affected citizens, that it is appropriate to change the use of the property to a use which does not qualify under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it may retain or dispose of the property for the changed use if the grantee's ICDBG program is reimbursed in the amount of the current fair market value of the property, less any portion of the value attributable to expenditures of non-ICDBG funds for acquisition of, and improvements to, the property.

(c) If the change of use occurs after program closeout, the proceeds from the disposition of the real property shall be used for activities which meet the eligibility requirements set forth in subpart C of this part and the primary objective set forth in § 1003.208.

(d) Following the reimbursement of the ICDBG program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the property no longer will be subject to any ICDBG requirements.
