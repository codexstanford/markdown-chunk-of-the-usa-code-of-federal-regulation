(a) In order to ensure that the policies of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321) (NEPA) and other provisions of Federal law which further the purposes of that act (as specified in 24 CFR 58.5) are most effectively implemented in connection with the expenditure of NHHBG funds, HUD will provide for the release of funds for specific projects to the DHHL if the Director of the DHHL assumes all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action under NEPA and other provisions of Federal law which further the purposes of that act (as specified in 24 CFR 58.5) that would apply to HUD were HUD to undertake those projects as Federal projects.

(b) An environmental review does not have to be completed before a HUD finding of compliance for the housing plan or amendments to the housing plan submitted by the DHHL.

(c) No funds may be committed to a grant activity or project before the completion of the environmental review and approval of the request for release of funds and related certification required by sections 806(b) and 806(c) of the Act, except as authorized by 24 CFR part 58.

(d) As set forth in section 806(a)(2)(B) of the Act and 24 CFR 58.77, HUD will:

(1) Provide for the monitoring of environmental reviews performed by the DHHL under this section;

(2) At its discretion, facilitate training for the performance of such reviews by the DHHL; and,

(3) At its discretion, provide for the suspension or termination of the assumption of responsibilities under this section based upon a finding of substantial failure of the DHHL to execute responsibilities under this section.
