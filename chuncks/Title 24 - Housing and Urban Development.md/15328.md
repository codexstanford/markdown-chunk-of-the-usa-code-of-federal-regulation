(2) The record is also subject to a FOIA exemption under § 2002.21(b) of this chapter.

(1) The final determination of the Inspector General, as Privacy Appeals Officer for the OIG, will be in writing and will constitute final action of the Department on a request for access to a record in an OIG system of records; and

(2) If the denial of the request is in whole or in part upheld, the final determination of the Inspector General will include notice of the right to judicial review.
