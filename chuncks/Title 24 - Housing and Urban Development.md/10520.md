(a)(1) An application to the field office for approval as a Public Housing Agency, other than an agency or instrumentality PHA, for purposes of this subpart shall be supported by evidence satisfactory to HUD to establish that:

(i) The applicant is a PHA as defined in this subpart, and has the legal authority to meet the requirements of this subpart and applicable Section 8 regulations, as described in its application. This evidence shall be supported by the opinion of counsel for the applicant.

(ii) The applicant has or will have the administrative capability to carry out the responsibilities described in its application.

(2) The evidence shall include any facts or documents relevant to the determinations required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including identification of any pending application the applicant has submitted under the Act. In the absence of evidence indicating the applicant may not be qualified, the field office may accept as satisfactory evidence:

(i) Identification of any previous HUD approval of the applicant as a PHA pursuant to this section;

(ii) Identification of any prior ACC with the applicant under the Act; or

(iii) A statement, where applicable, that the applicant is an approved participating agency under 24 CFR Part 883 (State Housing Finance and Development Agencies).

(b) The applicant shall receive no compensation in connection with the financing of a project, except for its expenses.
