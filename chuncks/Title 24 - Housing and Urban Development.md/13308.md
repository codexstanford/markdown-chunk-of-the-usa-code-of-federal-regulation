#### PART 970 - PUBLIC HOUSING PROGRAM - DEMOLITION OR DISPOSITION OF PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS
##### § 970.7 General requirements for HUD approval of a PHA demolition/disposition application.
###### Application for HUD Approval.

(a)A PHA must obtain written approval from HUD before undertaking any transaction involving demolition or disposition of PHA-owned property under the ACC. Where a PHA demolishes or disposes of public housing property without HUD approval, no HUD funds may be used to fund the costs of demolition or disposition or reimburse the PHA for those costs. HUD will approve an application for demolition or disposition upon the PHA's submission of an application with the required certifications and the supporting information required by this section and §§ 970.15 or 970.17. Section 970.29 specifies criteria for disapproval of an application. Approval of the application under this part does not imply approval of a request for additional funding, which the PHA must make separately under a program that makes available funding for this purpose. The PHA shall submit the application for demolition or disposition and the timetable in a time and manner and in a form prescribed by HUD. The supporting information shall include:

(1) A certification that the PHA has described the demolition or disposition in the PHA Annual Plan and timetable under 24 CFR part 903 (except in the case of small or high-performing PHAs eligible for streamlined annual plan treatment), and that the description in the PHA Annual Plan is identical to the application submitted pursuant to this part and otherwise complies with section 18 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437p) and this part;

(2) A description of all identifiable property, by development, including land, dwelling units, and other improvements, involved in the proposed demolition or disposition;

(3) A description of the specific action proposed, such as:

(i) Demolition, disposition, or demolition with disposition;

(ii) If disposition is involved, the method of sale;

(4) A general timetable for the proposed action(s), including the initial contract for demolition, the actual demolition, and, if applicable, the closing of sale or other form of disposition;

(5) A statement justifying the proposed demolition or disposition under the applicable criteria of §§ 970.15 or 970.17;

(6) If applicable, a plan for the relocation of tenants who would be displaced by the proposed demolition or disposition (including persons with disabilities requiring reasonable accommodations and a relocation timetable as prescribed in § 970.21);

(7) A description with supporting evidence of the PHA's consultations with residents, any resident organizations, and the Resident Advisory Board, as required under § 903.9 of this title;

(8) In the case of disposition only, evidence of compliance with the offering to resident organizations, as required under § 970.9;

(9) In the case of disposition, an estimate of the fair market value of the property, established on the basis of one independent appraisal, unless otherwise determined by HUD, as described in § 970.19(c);

(10) In the case of disposition, estimates of the gross and net proceeds to be realized, with an itemization of estimated costs to be paid out of gross proceeds and the proposed use of any net proceeds in accordance with § 970.19;

(11) An estimate of costs for any required relocation housing, moving costs, and counseling.

(12) Where the PHA is requesting a waiver of the requirement for the application of proceeds for repayment of outstanding debt, the PHA must request such a waiver in its application, along with a description of the proposed use of the proceeds;

(13) A copy of a resolution by the PHA's Board of Commissioners approving the specific demolition or disposition application (or, in the case of the report required under § 970.27(e) for "de minimis" demolitions, the Board of Commissioner's resolution approving the "de minimis" action) for that development or developments or portions thereof. The resolution must be signed and dated after all resident and local government consultation has been completed;

(14) Evidence that the application was developed in consultation with appropriate government officials as defined in § 970.5, including:

(i) A description of the process of consultation with local government officials, which summarizes dates, meetings, and issues raised by the local government officials and the PHA's responses to those issues;

(ii) A signed and dated letter in support of the application from the chief executive officer of the unit of local government that demonstrates that the PHA has consulted with the appropriate local government officials on the proposed demolition or disposition;

(iii) Where the local government consistently fails to respond to the PHA's attempts at consultation, including letters, requests for meetings, public notices, and other reasonable efforts, documentation of those attempts;

(iv) Where the PHA covers multiple jurisdictions (such as a regional housing authority), the PHA must meet these requirements for each of the jurisdictions where the PHA is proposing demolition or disposition of PHA property;

(15) An approved environmental review of the proposed demolition or disposition in accordance with 24 CFR parts 50 or 58 for any demolition or disposition of public housing property covered under this part, as required under 24 CFR 970.13;

(16) A certification that the demolition or disposition application does not violate any remedial civil rights order or agreement, voluntary compliance agreement, final judgment, consent decree, settlement agreement, or other court order or agreement;

(17) Any additional information necessary to support the application and assist HUD in making determinations under this part.
