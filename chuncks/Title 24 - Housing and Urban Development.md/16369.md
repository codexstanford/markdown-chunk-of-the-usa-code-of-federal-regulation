###### § 3285.3 Alterations during initial installation.

Additions, modifications, or replacement or removal of any equipment that affects the installation of the home made by the manufacturer, retailer, or installer prior to completion of the installation by an installer must equal or exceed the protections and requirements of these Model Installation Standards, the MHCSS (24 CFR part 3280) and the Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282). An alteration, as defined in § 3282.7 of this chapter, must not affect the ability of the basic manufactured home to comply with the MHCSS, and the alteration must not impose additional loads to the manufactured home or its foundation, unless the alteration is included in the manufacturer's DAPIA-approved designs and installation instructions, or is designed by a registered professional engineer or architect consistent with the manufacturer's design and that conforms to the requirements of the MHCSS.
