##### Subpart B - Bond-Type Securities
###### § 320.21 General.

In addition to the "pass-through" securities dealt with in subpart A of this part, the Association is authorized by section 306(g) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1721(g), upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, to guarantee the timely payment of principal of and interest on "bond-type" securities which are based on and backed by a trust or pool composed of mortgages which are insured or guaranteed by FHA, FmHA or the VA. The Association's guaranty of mortgage-backed securities is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. This subpart deals with such "bond-type" securities and does not purport to set forth all the procedures and requirements that apply to the issuance and guaranty of such securities. All such transactions are governed by the specific terms and provisions of the contracts entered into by the parties and the Bond-Type Securities Guide (the "Bond Guide").
