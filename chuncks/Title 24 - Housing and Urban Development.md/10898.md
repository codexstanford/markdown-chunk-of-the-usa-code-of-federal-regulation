(See 24 CFR part 883, revised as of April 1, 1980.) Projects for which applications or proposals were submitted before the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883 have been processed under the part 883 regulations and procedures in effect at the date of submission. If, however, the agency notified HUD within 60 calendar days of the February 29, 1980, effective date of the part 883 regulations that they chose to have the provisions of part 883, in effect as of February 29, 1980, apply to a specific case, it must have promptly modified the application(s) and proposal(s) to comply.

(b) Subpart F of this part, dealing with the HAP contract and subpart G of this part, dealing with management, apply to all projects for which an Agreement was not executed before the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883. In cases where an Agreement has been executed:

(1) The Agency, owner and HUD may agree to make the revised subpart F of this part applicable and execute appropriate amendments to the Agreement or Contract;

(2) The Agency, Owner and HUD may agree to make the revised subpart G of this part applicable (with or without the limitation on distributions) and execute appropriate amendments to the Agreement or Contract.
