(c) Tenant comments on the proposed covered action may be sent to the mortgagor at a specified address or directly to the local HUD office, and comments sent to the mortgagor will be transmitted to HUD, along with the mortgagor's evaluation of them, when the request for HUD's approval is submitted;

(d) HUD will approve or disapprove the proposed action, based upon its review of the information submitted and all tenant comments received. In the case of a proposed reduction in tenant-paid utilities, the notice must also state that HUD may adjust the proposed reduction upward or downward;

(e) In the case of a proposed conversion of residential units, partial release of mortgage security, or major capital additions to the project, the proposed action may require the owner to request HUD approval of a rent increase; and

(f) The mortgagor will notify the tenants of HUD's decision and it will not begin to effect any approved action (in accordance with the terms of existing leases) until at least 30 days from the date of service of the notification.
