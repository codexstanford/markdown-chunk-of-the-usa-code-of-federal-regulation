###### § 180.705 Attorney's fees and costs.

Following the issuance of the final decision, any prevailing party, except HUD, may apply for attorney's fees and costs. The ALJ will issue an initial decision awarding or denying such fees and costs. The initial decision will become HUD's final decision unless the Secretary reviews the initial decision and issues a final decision on fees and costs within 30 days. The recovery of reasonable attorney's fees and costs will be permitted as follows:

(a) If the respondent is the prevailing party, HUD will be liable for reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the extent provided under the Equal Access to Justice Act (5 U.S.C. 504) and HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 14, and an intervenor will be liable for reasonable attorney's fees and costs only to the extent that the intervenor's participation in the administrative proceeding was frivolous or vexatious, or was for the purpose of harassment.

(b) To the extent that an intervenor is a prevailing party, the respondent will be liable for reasonable attorney's fees unless special circumstances make the recovery of such fees and costs unjust.
