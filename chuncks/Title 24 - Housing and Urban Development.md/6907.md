All current or future property (including personalty) of the mortgagor on or off mortgaged real estate (except that specifically restricted by donors or specifically excluded by HUD) will be considered as part of the HUD-insured hospital and subject to all provisions of the HUD regulatory agreement. All equipment acquired by the hospital following initial endorsement and at any time during the term of the loan shall become subject to the lien of the security agreement and any Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statements filed pursuant to the security agreement, unless the mortgagor specifically requests and HUD, for good cause, approves subordination of the lien of the insured mortgagee on specific personalty for specific periods of time. The first lien on the realty (as defined in the regulatory agreement and as identified in the security instrument) cannot be subordinated in whole or in part.
