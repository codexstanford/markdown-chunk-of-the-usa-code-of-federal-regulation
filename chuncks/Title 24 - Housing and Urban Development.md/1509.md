##### § 27.40 Disposition of sale proceeds.

(a) The priority of the Secretary's lien shall be determined by the Federal first-in-time first-in-right rule. State laws affording priority to liens recorded after the mortgage are preempted.

(b) If there is more than one party holding a lien or assessment payable from sales proceeds, the claim of each party holding the same kind of lien or assessment will be given the relative priority to which it would be entitled under the law of the State in which the security property is located.

(c) The commissioner will keep such records as will permit the Secretary to verify the costs claimed under section 369C of the Act (12 U.S.C. 3711), and otherwise to audit the commissioner's disposition of the sale proceeds.
