######## § 266.616 Transfer of partial interest under participation agreement.

The HFA may not assign the mortgage. However, a partial interest in an insured mortgage or pool of insured mortgages may be transferred under a participation agreement or arrangement (such as a declaration of trust or the issuance of pass-through certificates), without obtaining the approval of the Commissioner, if the following conditions are met:

(a) Legal title to the insured mortgage or mortgages shall be held by the HFA; and

(b) The participation agreement, declaration of trust or other instrument under which the partial interest is transferred shall provide that:

(1) The HFA shall remain mortgagee of record under the contract of mortgage insurance;

(2) The Commissioner shall have no obligation to recognize or deal with anyone other than the HFA with respect to the rights, benefits, and obligations of the mortgagee under the contract of insurance; and

(3) The mortgagor shall have no obligation to recognize or do business with any one other than the HFA or, if applicable, its servicing agent with respect to rights, benefits, and obligations of the mortgagor or the mortgagee under the mortgage.
