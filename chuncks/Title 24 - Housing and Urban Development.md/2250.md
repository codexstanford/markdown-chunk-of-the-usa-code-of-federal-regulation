##### § 58.6 Other requirements.

In addition to the duties under the laws and authorities specified in § 58.5 for assumption by the responsible entity under the laws cited in § 58.1(b), the responsible entity must comply with the following requirements. Applicability of the following requirements does not trigger the certification and release of funds procedure under this part or preclude exemption of an activity under § 58.34(a)(12) and/or the applicability of § 58.35(b). However, the responsible entity remains responsible for addressing the following requirements in its ERR and meeting these requirements, where applicable, regardless of whether the activity is exempt under § 58.34 or categorically excluded under § 58.35(a) or (b).

(a)(1) Under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001-4128), Federal financial assistance for acquisition and construction purposes (including rehabilitation) may not be used in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as having special flood hazards, unless:

(i) The community in which the area is situated is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (see 44 CFR parts 59 through 79), or less than one year has passed since the FEMA notification regarding such hazards; and

(ii) Where the community is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program, flood insurance protection is to be obtained as a condition of the approval of financial assistance to the property owner.

(2) Where the community is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program and the recipient provides financial assistance for acquisition or construction purposes (including rehabilitation) for property located in an area identified by FEMA as having special flood hazards, the responsible entity is responsible for assuring that flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program is obtained and maintained.

(3) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to Federal formula grants made to a State.

(4) Flood insurance requirements cannot be fulfilled by self-insurance except as authorized by law for assistance to state-owned projects within states approved by the Federal Insurance Administrator consistent with 44 CFR 75.11.

(b) Under section 582 of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. 5154a, HUD disaster assistance that is made available in a special flood hazard area may not be used to make a payment (including any loan assistance payment) to a person for repair, replacement or restoration for flood damage to any personal, residential or commercial property if:

(1) The person had previously received Federal flood disaster assistance conditioned on obtaining and maintaining flood insurance; and

(2) The person failed to obtain and maintain flood insurance.

(c) Pursuant to the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, as amended by the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3501), HUD assistance may not be used for most activities proposed in the Coastal Barrier Resources System.

(d) In all cases involving HUD assistance, subsidy, or insurance for the purchase or sale of an existing property in a Runway Clear Zone or Clear Zone, as defined in 24 CFR part 51, the responsible entity shall advise the buyer that the property is in a runway clear zone or clear zone, what the implications of such a location are, and that there is a possibility that the property may, at a later date, be acquired by the airport operator. The buyer must sign a statement acknowledging receipt of this information.
