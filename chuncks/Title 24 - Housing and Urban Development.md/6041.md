On the date of the first principal payment, the mortgagee shall pay a third premium equal to not less than one-fourth of one percent nor more than one percent of the average outstanding principal obligation of the mortgage for the following year which shall be adjusted so as to accord with such date and so that the aggregate of the said three premiums shall equal the sum of:
