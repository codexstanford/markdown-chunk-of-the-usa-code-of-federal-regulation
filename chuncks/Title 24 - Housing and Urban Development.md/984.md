##### § 10.20 Petition for rulemaking.

(a) Any interested person may petition the Secretary for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. Each petition shall:

(1) Be submitted to the Rules Docket Clerk, Room 5218, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC 20410;

(2) Set forth the text of substance of the rule or amendment proposed or specify the rule sought to be repealed;

(3) Explain the interest of the petitioner in the action sought; and

(4) Set forth all data and arguments available to the petitioner in support of the action sought.

(b) No public procedures will be held directly on the petition before its disposition. If the Secretary finds that the petition contains adequate justification, a rulemaking proceeding will be initiated or a final rule will be issued as appropriate. If the Secretary finds that the petition does not contain adequate justification, the petition will be denied by letter or other notice, with a brief statement of the ground for denial. The Secretary may consider new evidence at any time; however, repetitious petitions for rulemaking will not be considered.
