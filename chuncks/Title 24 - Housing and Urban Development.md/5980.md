######## § 206.138 Mortgagee's liability for certain expenditures.

Where the Commissioner accepts an assignment, acquires a property after accepting an assignment of a mortgage, or otherwise pays a claim for insurance benefits and thereafter it becomes necessary for the Commissioner to either reconvey the property or reassign the mortgage to the mortgagee due to the mortgagee's noncompliance with these regulations, the mortgagee shall reimburse the Commissioner for all expenses incurred in connection with such acquisition and reconveyance or reassignment. The reimbursement shall include interest on the amount of insurance benefits refunded by the mortgagee from the date the insurance benefits were paid to the date of refund at an interest rate set in conformity with the Treasury Fiscal Requirements Manual, and the Commissioner's cost of holding the property or servicing the mortgage, accruing on a daily basis, from the date of assignment or claim payment to the date of reconveyance or reassignment. These costs are based on the Commissioner's estimate of the taxes, maintenance and operating expenses of the property, and administrative expenses. Appropriate adjustments shall be made by the Commissioner on account of any income received from the property.
