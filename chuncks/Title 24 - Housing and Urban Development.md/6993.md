####### § 246.11 Notification of action on preemption request.

(a) After HUD has considered the preemption request which meets the requirements of § 246.9 and has made its determination to approve or disapprove the request, it will furnish the mortgagor with a written statement of the reasons for approval or disapproval. The mortgagor shall make known to tenants, by posting or delivery in the manner outlined in § 246.7, the reasons for approval or disapproval.

(b) The mortgagor may effect collection of the HUD-approved income level which is set at the time of the preemption determination after the expiration of 30-days notice to the tenants, subject to the terms and rights a tenant may have under the existing lease.

(c) Once the project reaches the income level approved under these procedures, the project will be returned to the control of the local rent control board covering both the rents and the terms of prospective leases.
