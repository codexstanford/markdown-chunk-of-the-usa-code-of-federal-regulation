####### § 574.350 Additional standards for broadband infrastructure.

Any new construction or substantial rehabilitation, as substantial rehabilitation is defined by 24 CFR 574.3, of a building with more than 4 rental units, for which HOPWA funds are first obligated by the grantee or project sponsor on or after January 19, 2017 must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the grantee or project sponsor determines and, in accordance with § 574.530, documents the determination that:

(a) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;

(b) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or

(c) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.
