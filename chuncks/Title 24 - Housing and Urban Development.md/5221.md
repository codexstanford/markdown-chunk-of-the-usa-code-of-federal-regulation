######## § 203.32 Mortgage lien.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a mortgagor must establish that, after the mortgage offered for insurance has been recorded, the mortgaged property will be free and clear of all liens other than such mortgage, and that there will not be outstanding any other unpaid obligations contracted in connection with the mortgage transaction or the purchase of the mortgaged property, except obligations that are secured by property or collateral owned by the mortgagor independently of the mortgaged property.

(b) With prior approval of the Secretary, the mortgaged property may be subject to a secondary mortgage or loan made or insured, or other secondary lien held, by a Federal, State, or local government agency or instrumentality, or an entity designated in the homeownership plan submitted by an applicant for an implementation grant under the Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE) program, or an eligible nonprofit organization as defined in § 203.41(a)(5) of this part, provided that the required monthly payments under the insured mortgage and the secondary mortgage or lien shall not exceed the mortgagor's reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary.

(c) With the prior approval of the Secretary, the mortgaged property may be subject to a second mortgage held by a mortgagee not described in paragraph (b) of this section. Unless the mortgage is for the purpose described in paragraph (d) of this section, it shall meet the following requirements:

(1) The required monthly payments under the insured mortgage and the second mortgage shall not exceed the mortgagor's reasonable ability to pay, as determined by the Commissioner;

(2) Periodic payments, if any, shall be collected monthly and be substantially the same;

(3) The sum of the principal amount of the insured mortgage and the second mortgage shall not exceed the loan-to-value limitation applicable to the insured mortgage, and shall not exceed the maximum mortgage limit for the area;

(4) The repayment terms shall not provide for a balloon payment before ten years, or for such other term as the Commissioner may approve, except that the mortgage may become due and payable on sale or refinancing of the secured property covered by the insured mortgage; and

(5) The mortgage shall contain a provision permitting the mortgagor to prepay the mortgage in whole or in part at any time, and shall not provide for the payment of any charge on account of such prepayment.

(d)(1) With the prior approval of the Commissioner, the mortgaged property may be subject to a junior (second or third) mortgage securing the repayment of funds advanced to reduce the mortgagor's monthly payments on the insured mortgage following the date it is insured, if the junior mortgage meets the following requirements:

(i) The junior mortgage shall not provide for any payment of principal or interest until the property securing the junior mortgage is sold or the insured mortgage is refinanced, at which time the junior mortgage shall become due and payable;

(ii) The total amount of repayments under the junior mortgage shall not exceed the least of:

(A) One-half of the mortgagor's equity interest in the property at the time of sale or refinancing;

(B) Three times the amount of funds advanced to effect the interest rate buy-down; or

(C) The sum of the original loan amount plus the total accrued interest on the junior mortgage at the time of repayment; and

(iii) The junior mortgage shall contain a provision permitting the mortgagor to prepay the mortgage in whole or in part at any time, and shall not provide for the payment of any charge on account of such prepayment. Any full or partial prepayment will not be recoverable by the mortgagor if, by application of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) on sale or refinancing of the property, a lesser amount than the amount prepaid would have been due.

(2) The sum of the principal amount of the insured mortgage, any second mortgage made under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, and the mortgage securing the repayment of funds advanced to reduce the borrower's monthly payments (whether a second or third mortgage) may exceed the loan-to-value limitation applicable to the insured mortgage, but such sum may not exceed the maximum mortgage limit for the area.
