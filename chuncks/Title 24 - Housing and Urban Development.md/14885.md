###### § 1003.102 Use of recaptured and unawarded funds.

(a) The Assistant Secretary will determine on a case-by-case basis the use of grant funds which are:

(1) Recaptured by HUD under the provisions of § 1003.703 or § 1003.704;

(2) Recaptured by HUD at the time of the closeout of a program; or

(3) Unawarded after the completion by an Area ONAP of a funding competition.

(b) The recaptured or unawarded funds will remain with the Area ONAP to which they were originally allocated unless the Assistant Secretary determines that there is an overriding reason to redistribute these funds outside of the Area ONAP's jurisdiction. The recaptured funds may be used to fund the highest ranking unfunded project from the most recent funding competition, an imminent threat, or other uses. Unawarded funds may be used to fund an imminent threat or other uses.
