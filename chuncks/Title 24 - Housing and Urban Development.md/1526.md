##### § 27.107 Presale reinstatement.

(a) The foreclosure commissioner shall withdraw the security property from foreclosure and cancel the foreclosure sale only in accordance with the provisions of the Statute and as more fully provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section in regard to presale reinstatements.

(b) To obtain a presale reinstatement in cases involving a monetary default, there must be tendered to the foreclosure commissioner before public auction is completed all amounts which would be due under the mortgage agreement if payments under the mortgage had not been accelerated and all costs of foreclosure incurred for which payment from the proceeds of foreclosure is provided in the Statute, and the foreclosure commissioner must find that there are no nonmonetary defaults; provided, however, that the Secretary may refuse to cancel a foreclosure sale pursuant to this subparagraph if the current mortgagor or owner of record has, on one or more previous occasions, caused a foreclosure of the mortgage, commenced pursuant to the Statute and this subpart or otherwise, to be canceled by curing a default.

(c) To obtain a presale reinstatement in cases involving a nonmonetary default:

(1) The foreclosure commissioner, upon application of the mortgagor before the date of foreclosure sale, must find that all nonmonetary defaults are cured and that there are no monetary defaults; and

(2) There must be tendered to the foreclosure commissioner before public auction is completed all amounts due under the mortgage agreement (excluding all amounts which would be due under the mortgage agreement if the mortgage payments had been accelerated), including all amounts of expenditures secured by the mortgage and all costs of foreclosure incurred for which payment would be made from the proceeds of foreclosure as provided in the Statute.

(d) Before withdrawing the security property from foreclosure, the foreclosure commissioner shall notify the Secretary of the proposed withdrawal by telephone or other telecommunication device and shall also provide the Secretary with a written statement of the reasons for the proposed withdrawal along with all documents submitted by the mortgagor in support of the proposed withdrawal. Upon receipt of this statement, the Secretary shall have ten (10) days in which to demonstrate why the security property should not be withdrawn from foreclosure, and if the Secretary makes this demonstration, the property shall not be withdrawn from foreclosure. The Secretary shall provide the mortgagor with a copy of any statement prepared by the Secretary in opposition to the proposed withdrawal at the same time the statement is submitted to the foreclosure commissioner. If the Secretary receives the foreclosure commissioner's written statement less than 10 days before the scheduled foreclosure sale, the sale shall automatically be adjourned for 14 days, during which time it may be cancelled. Notice of the re-scheduled sale, if any, shall be served as described in § 27.111.
