###### § 180.305 Representation.

(a) HUD is represented by the General Counsel.

(b) Any party may appear on his/her/its own behalf or by an attorney. Each party or attorney shall file a notice of appearance. The notice must identify the matter before the ALJ, the party on whose behalf the appearance is made, and the mailing address and telephone number of the person appearing. Similar notice shall also be given for any withdrawal of appearance.

(c) An attorney must be admitted to practice before a Federal Court or the highest court in any State. The attorney's representation that he/she is in good standing before any of these courts is sufficient evidence of the attorney's qualifications under this section, unless otherwise ordered by the ALJ.
