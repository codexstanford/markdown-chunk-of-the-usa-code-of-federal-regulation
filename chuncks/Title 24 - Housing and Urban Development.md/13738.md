(a) This section applies to HCV assistance if all the following conditions are applicable:

(1) Such HCV assistance is provided to a family pursuant to 24 CFR 401.421 when HUD has approved a restructuring plan, and the participating administrative entity has approved the use of tenant-based assistance to provide continued assistance for such families. Such tenant-based voucher assistance is provided for a family previously receiving project-based assistance in an eligible project (as defined in § 401.2 of this title) at the time when the project-based assistance terminates.

(2) The family chooses to remain in the restructured project with HCV assistance under the program and leases a unit that does not exceed the family unit size;

(3) The lease for such assisted tenancy commences during the first year after the project-based assistance terminates.

(b) The initial payment standard for the family under such initial lease is the sum of the reasonable rent to owner for the unit plus the utility allowance for tenant-paid utilities. (Determination of such initial payment standard for the family is not subject to paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of § 982.505. Except for determination of the initial payment standard as specifically provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the payment standard and housing assistance payment for the family during the HAP contract term shall be determined in accordance with § 982.505.)
