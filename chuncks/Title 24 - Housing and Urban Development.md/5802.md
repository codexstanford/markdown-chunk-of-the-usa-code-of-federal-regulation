######## § 206.35 Title of property which is security for HECM.

(a) A mortgagor is not required to be a borrower; however, any borrower is required to be on title to the property which serves as collateral for the HECM, and is therefore, by definition, also a mortgagor.

(b) The mortgagor shall hold title to the entire property which is the security for the mortgage. If there are multiple mortgagors, all the mortgagors must collectively hold title to the entire property which is the security for the mortgage. If one or more mortgagors hold a life estate in the property, for purposes of this section only, the term "mortgagor" shall include each holder of a future interest in the property (remainder or reversion) who has executed the mortgage.

(c) If Non-Borrowing Spouses and non-borrowing owners of the property will continue to hold title to the property which serves as collateral for the HECM, such Non-Borrowing Spouses and non-borrowing owners must sign the mortgage as mortgagors, evidencing their commitment of the property as security for the mortgage.

(d) All Non-Borrowing Spouses and non-borrowing owners shall sign a certification that:

(1) Consents to their spouse or other borrowing owner obtaining the HECM;

(2) Acknowledges the terms and conditions of the mortgage; and

(3) Acknowledges that the property will serve as collateral for the HECM as evidenced by mortgage lien(s).
