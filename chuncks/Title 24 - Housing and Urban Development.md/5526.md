(2) Easements for public utilities along one or more of the property lines and extending not more than 10 feet therefrom and for drainage or irrigation ditches along the rear 10 feet of the property, provided the exercise of the rights thereunder do not interfere with any of the buildings or improvements located on the subject property.

(c) Easements for underground conduits which are in place and do not extend under any buildings on the subject property;

(d) Mutual easements for joint driveways constructed partly on the subject property and partly on adjoining property, provided the agreements creating such easements are of record;

(e) Encroachments on the subject property by improvements on adjoining property where such encroachments do not exceed 1 foot, provided such encroachments do not touch any buildings or interfere with the use of any improvements on the subject property;

(f) Encroachments on adjoining property by eaves and overhanging projections attached to improvements on subject property where such encroachments do not exceed 1 foot.

(g) Encroachments on adjoining property by hedges, wooden or wire fences belonging to the subject property;

(h) Encroachments on adjoining property by driveways belonging to subject property where such encroachments do not exceed 1 foot, provided there exists a clearance of at least 8 feet between the buildings on the subject property and the property line affected by the encroachment;

(i) Variations between the length of the subject property lines as shown on the application for insurance and as shown by the record or possession lines, provided such variations do not interfere with the use of any of the improvements on the subject property and do not involve a deficiency of more than 2 percent with respect to the length of the front line or more than 5 percent with respect to the length of any other line;

(j) Encroachments by garages or improvements other than those which are attached to or a portion of the main dwelling structure over easements for public utilities, provided such encroachment does not interfere with the use of the easement or the exercise of the rights of repair and maintenance in connection therewith;

(k) Violations of cost or set back restrictions which do not provide a penalty of reversion or forfeiture of title, or a lien for liquidated damages which may be superior to the lien of the insured mortgage. Violations of such restrictions which do provide for such penalties, provided such penalty rights have been duly released or subordinated to the lien of the insured mortgage, or provided a policy of title insurance is furnished expressly insuring the Commissioner against loss by reason of such penalties.

(l) Customary building and use restrictions which:

(1) Are coupled with a reversionary clause, provided there has been no violation prior to the date of the deed to the Commissioner; or

(2) Are not coupled with a reversionary clause and have not been violated to a material extent.

(m) Outstanding oil, water or mineral rights (or damage caused by the exercise of such rights) which are customarily waived by prudent leading institutions and leading attorneys in the community.

(n) The voluntary or involuntary conveyance of a part of the subject property pursuant to condemnation proceedings or in lieu of condemnation proceedings, if:

(1) The part conveyed does not exceed 10 percent by area of the property;

(2) No damage to existing structures, improvements, or unrepaired damage to sewage, water, or paving has been suffered;

(3) All of the payment received as compensation for the taking by condemnation or conveyance in lieu of condemnation has been applied to reduction of the mortgage indebtedness;

(4) The conveyance occurred subsequent to insurance of the mortgage; and

(5) There is included with the documents and information furnished the Commissioner with the application for insurance benefits, a statement by the mortgagee that the requirements of this paragraph have been met.

(o) Federal tax liens and rights of redemption arising therefrom if the following conditions are observed. If the mortgagee acquires the property by foreclosure the mortgagee shall give notice to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the foreclosure action. The Commissioner will not object to an outstanding right of redemption in IRS if: (1) The Federal tax lien was perfected subsequent to the date of the mortgage lien, and (2) The mortgagee has bid an amount sufficient to make the mortgagee whole if the property is in fact redeemed by the IRS.
