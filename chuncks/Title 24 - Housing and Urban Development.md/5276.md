######## § 203.43d Eligibility of mortgages in certain communities.

Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subpart, a mortgage covering a one- to four-family dwelling occupied by the mortgagor as a principal residence (as defined in § 203.18(f)(1)) is eligible for insurance if the following requirements are met:

(a) The property is located in a community where the Secretary determines that:

(1) Temporary adverse economic conditions exist throughout the community as a direct and primary result of outstanding claims to ownership of land in the community by an American Indian tribe, band, or Nation;

(2) Such ownership claims are reasonably likely to be settled, by court action or otherwise;

(3) As a direct result of the community's temporarily impaired economic condition, owners of homes in the community occupied as principal residences (as defined in § 203.18(f)(1)) have been involuntarily unemployed or underemployed and have, thus, incurred substantial reductions in income that significantly impair their ability to continue timely payment of their mortgages;

(4) As a result, widespread mortgage foreclosures and distress sales of homes are likely in the community; and

(5) Fifty or more individuals were joined as parties defendant or were members of a defendant class prior to December 31, 1976 in litigation involving claims to ownership of land in the community by an American Indian tribe, band or Nation.

(b) The mortgagor, as a direct result of the community's temporarily impaired economic condition, has been involuntarily unemployed or underemployed and has thus incurred a substantial reduction in income which significantly impairs the owners ability to continue timely payment of the mortgage.

(c) The mortgagee certifies that the security instrument has been recorded and is a good and valid first lien on the property except for the claims specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(d) The mortgagee agrees upon insurance of the mortgage to assign such mortgage to the Secretary within 30 days from the date of the issuance of the insurance certificate and if such assignment does not take place, the contract of insurance is terminated and becomes null and void.

(e) Any individual, organization, institution or governmental agency shall be considered a mortgagee for the purposes of this section.

(f) Mortgages complying with the requirements of this section shall be insured under this subpart pursuant to section 203(o) of the National Housing Act. Such mortgages shall be insured under and be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.

(g) The mortgage was executed and filed for record on or before October 12, 1977.
