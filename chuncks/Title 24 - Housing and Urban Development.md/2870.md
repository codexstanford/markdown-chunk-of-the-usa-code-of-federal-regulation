###### Homelessness.

(d)The consolidated plan must include the priority homeless needs table prescribed by HUD and must describe the jurisdiction's strategy for reducing and ending homelessness through:

(1) Reaching out to homeless persons (especially unsheltered persons) and assessing their individual needs;

(2) Addressing the emergency shelter and transitional housing needs of homeless persons;

(3) Helping homeless persons (especially chronically homeless individuals and families, families with children, veterans and their families, and unaccompanied youth) make the transition to permanent housing and independent living, including shortening the period of time individuals and families experience homelessness, facilitating access for homeless individuals and families to affordable housing units, and preventing individuals and families who were recently homeless from becoming homeless again; and

(4) Helping low-income individuals and families avoid becoming homeless, especially extremely low-income individuals and families who are:

(i) Likely to become homeless after being discharged from publicly funded institutions and systems of care into homelessness (such as health-care facilities, mental health facilities, foster care and other youth facilities, and corrections programs and institutions) or

(ii) Receiving assistance from public and private agencies that address housing, health, social services, employment, education, or youth needs.
