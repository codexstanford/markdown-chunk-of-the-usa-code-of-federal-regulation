###### § 906.33 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

The PHA is responsible for the maintenance of records (including sale and financial records) for all activities incident to implementation of the HUD-approved homeownership program. Where a PRE is responsible for the sale of units, the PHA must ensure that the PRE's responsibilities include proper recordkeeping and accountability to the PHA, sufficient to enable the PHA to monitor compliance with the approved homeownership program and to meet its audit responsibilities. All books and records must be subject to inspection and audit by HUD and the General Accounting Office (GAO). The PHA must report annually to HUD on the progress of each program approved under this part. The PHA must report as part of the Annual Plan process under § 903.7(k) of this title, except for those PHAs under §§ 903.11(c)(1) and (2) of this title who are not required to include information on their public housing homeownership programs in their Annual Plan. Those PHAs must report by providing a description of the homeownership program to HUD, including the cumulative number of units sold.
