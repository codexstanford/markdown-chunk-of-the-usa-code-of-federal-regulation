(a) The mortgagor shall file its application for approval of increases in rental charges with the appropriate local office of HUD.

(b) The local HUD office will process the application for increases in rental charges in accordance with HUD's regulations, including part 245 of this chapter, and instructions and procedures, all adopted pursuant to the statutory authority described in § 246.8, and shall notify in writing any board in the area in which the project is located that it is processing the application and, that, pursuant to this subpart, HUD has preempted the entire field of rent regulation by a board acting pursuant to state or local law as it affects the project.

(c) The mortgagor may effect collection of the new rents in accordance with the procedures described in part 245, subpart D of this chapter. The mortgagor shall furnish the board a schedule of any new rents approved by HUD within ten (10) days after the approved rents have become effective. Notice to the board of the approved increases in rents does not confer upon the board a right to approve or disapprove the Department's action or to exercise jurisdiction over the implementation of the rent increases by the mortgagor. The sole purpose of the notice is to inform the board of the lawful rents that may be charged for projects covered by this subpart.
