(3) For all homes, the home may also be required to comply with additional state and local requirements for its installation;

(4) For all homes, additional information about the requirements disclosed under paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section is available from the retailer and, in the case of the federal requirements, is available in part 3286 of Title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations and from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development;

(5) For all homes, compliance with any additional federal, state, and local requirements, including a requirement for inspection of the installation of the home, may involve additional costs to the purchaser or lessee; and
