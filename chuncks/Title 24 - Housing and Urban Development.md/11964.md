###### § 902.83 Sanctions for troubled performer PHAs.

(a) If a troubled performer PHA fails to make substantial improvement, as set forth in § 902.75(d), HUD shall:

(1) In the case of a troubled performer PHA with 1,250 or more units, declare substantial default in accordance with § 907.3(b)(3) of this chapter and petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)); or

(2) In the case of a troubled performer PHA with fewer than 1,250 units, declare substantial default in accordance with § 907.3(b)(3) of this chapter and either petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)), or take possession of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA) pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(iv)), and appoint, on a competitive or noncompetitive basis, an individual or entity as an administrative receiver to assume the responsibilities of HUD for the administration of all or part of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA).

(3) In the case of substantial default by a troubled performer PHA, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the courses of action available to HUD under this part, 24 CFR part 907, or section 6(j)(3)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)) for any other substantial default by a PHA.

(b) If a troubled performer PHA fails to execute or meet the requirements of an MOA in accordance with § 902.75, other than as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA may be deemed to be in substantial default by HUD and any remedy available therefore may be invoked in the discretion of HUD.
