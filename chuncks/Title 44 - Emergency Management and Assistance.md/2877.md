(a) Assess NRC nuclear facility (e.g., commercial power plants, fuel processing centers and research reactors) licensee emergency plans for adequacy to protect the health and safety of the public.

(b) Verify that nuclear facility licensee emergency plans can be adequately implemented (e.g., adequacy and maintenance of equipment, procedures, training, resources, staffing levels and qualifications).

(c) Review FEMA's findings and determinations of State and local radiological emergency plans for areas surrounding NRC licensed nuclear facilities.

(d) Take into account the overall state of emergency preparedness in making decisions to issue operating licenses or shut down licensed operating reactors, including the integration of assessments of emergency preparedness onsite by the NRC and offsite by FEMA.

(e) Where not already established, determine, in cooperation with other Federal agencies, the appropriate planning bases for NRC licensed nuclear facilities including distances, times and radiological characteristics.

(f) Assist FEMA in developing and promulgating guidance to State and local governments for the preparation of radiological emergency plans.

(g) Participate with FEMA in assisting State and local governments in developing their radiological emergency plans, evaluating exercises to test plans and evaluating the plans and preparedness.

(l) Assist FEMA in the development of guidance for State and local governments on emergency instrumentation systems for radiation detection and measurement.

(m) Assist FEMA with the development, implementation and presentation to the extent that resources permit of training programs for Federal, State and local radiological emergency preparedness personnel.

(n) Assist FEMA in providing guidance and assistance to State and local governments concerning the storage and distribution of radioprotective substances and prophylactic use of drugs (e.g., potassium iodide) to reduce the radiation dose to specific organs as a result of radiological emergencies.
