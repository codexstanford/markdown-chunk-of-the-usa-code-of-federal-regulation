(a) Upon written request by the Sponsoring Agency DHS will reopen the time period for submission of a request for reimbursement after the Sponsoring Agency has submitted its request for reimbursement, if:

(1) The salary or wage rate applicable to the period of an Activation is retroactively changed due to the execution of a collective bargaining agreement, or due to the adoption of a generally applicable State or local law, ordinance or wage order or a cost-of-living adjustment;

(2) The Sponsoring Agency or any Participating Agency incurs an additional cost because of a legally-binding determination; or

(3) The Deputy Director determines that other extenuating circumstances existed that prevented the Sponsoring Agency from including the adjustment of costs in its original submission.

(c) The Sponsoring Agency must notify DHS as early as practicable that it anticipates such a request.
