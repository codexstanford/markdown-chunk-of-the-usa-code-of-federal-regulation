####### ex parte

(a) If a person refuses to permit a duly authorized representative of FEMA to have access to any premises or source of information necessary to the administration or enforcement of the Defense Production Act and other applicable statutes, this part, or official actions, FEMA may seek compulsory process. Compulsory process means the institution of appropriate legal action, includingapplication for an inspection warrant or its equivalent, in any forum of appropriate jurisdiction.

(b) Compulsory process may be sought in advance of an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, if, in the judgment of the Administrator, in consultation with the FEMA Chief Counsel, there is reason to believe that a person will refuse to permit an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, or that other circumstances exist which make such process desirable or necessary.
