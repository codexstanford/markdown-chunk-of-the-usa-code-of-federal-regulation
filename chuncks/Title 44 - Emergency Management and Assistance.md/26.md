##### § 4.9 How does the Administrator receive and respond to comments?

(a) The Administrator follows the procedures in § 4.10 if:

(1) A State office or official is designated to act as a single point of contact between a state process and all Federal agencies, and

(2) That office or official transmits a state process recommendation for a program selected under § 4.6.

(b)(1) The single point of contact is not obligated to transmit comments from State, areawide, regional or local officials and entities where there is no state process recommendation.

(2) If a state process recommendation is transmitted by a single point of contact, all comments from state, areawide, regional, and local officials and entities that differ from it must also be transmitted.

(c) If a State has not established a process, or is unable to submit a state process recommendation, State, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit comments to FEMA.

(d) If a program or activity is not selected for a state process, State, areawide, regional and local officials and entities may submit comments to FEMA. In addition, if a state process recommendation for a nonselected program or activity is transmitted to FEMA by the single point of contact, the Administrator follows the procedures of § 4.10 of this part.

(e) The Administrator considers comments which do not constitute a state process recommendation submitted under these regulations and for which the Administrator is not required to apply the procedures of § 4.10 of this part, when such comments are provided by a single point of contact, by the applicant or directly to FEMA by a commenting party.
