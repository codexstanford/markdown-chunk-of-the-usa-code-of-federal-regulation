(a) Allocation orders will:

(1) Be used only when there is insufficient supply of a material, service, or facility to satisfy national defense requirements through the use of the priorities authority or when the use of the priorities authority would cause a severe and prolonged disruption in the supply of materials, services, or facilities available to support normal U.S. economic activities; and

(2) Not be used to ration materials or services at the retail level.

(b) Allocation orders, when used, will be distributed equitably among the suppliers of the materials, services, or facilities being allocated and not require any person to relinquish a disproportionate share of the civilian market.

(c) When a hazard has occurred or is imminent, an allocation order may be used without regard to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section whenever it is deemed by the Administrator to be necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense.
