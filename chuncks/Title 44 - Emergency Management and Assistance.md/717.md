###### § 60.23 Planning considerations for mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas.

The planning process for communities identified under part 65 of this subchapter as containing Zone M, or which indicate in their applications for flood insurance pursuant to § 59.22 of this subchapter that they have mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas, should include-

(a) The existence and extent of the hazard;

(b) The potential effects of inappropriate hillside development, including

(1) Loss of life and personal injuries, and

(2) Public and private property losses, costs, liabilities, and exposures resulting from potential mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards;

(c) The means of avoiding the hazard including the (1) availability of land which is not mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone and the feasibility of developing such land instead of further encroaching upon mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas, (2) possibility of public acquisition of land, easements, and development rights to assure the proper development of hillsides, and (3) advisability of preserving mudslide (i.e., mudflow) areas as open space;

(d) The means of adjusting to the hazard, including the (1) establishment by ordinance of site exploration, investigation, design, grading, construction, filing, compacting, foundation, sewerage, drainage, subdrainage, planting, inspection and maintenance standards and requirements that promote proper land use, and (2) provision for proper drainage and subdrainage on public property and the location of public utilities and service facilities, such as sewer, water, gas and electrical systems and streets in a manner designed to minimize exposure to mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards and prevent their aggravation;

(e) Coordination of land use, sewer, and drainage regulations and ordinances with fire prevention, flood plain, mudslide (i.e., mudflow), soil, land, and water regulation in neighboring communities;

(f) Planning subdivisions and other developments in such a manner as to avoid exposure to mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards and the control of public facility and utility extension to discourage inappropriate development;

(g) Public facility location and design requirements with higher site stability and access standards for schools, hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, correctional and other residential institutions, fire and police stations, communication centers, electric power transformers and substations, water and sewer pumping stations and any other public or quasi-public institutions located in the mudslide (i.e., mudflow) area to enable them to withstand mudslide (i.e., mudflow) damage and to facilitate emergency operations; and

(h) Provision for emergencies, including:

(1) Warning, evacuation, abatement, and access procedures in the event of mudslide (i.e., mudflow),

(2) Enactment of public measures and initiation of private procedures to limit danger and damage from continued or future mudslides (i.e., mudflow),

(3) Fire prevention procedures in the event of the rupture of gas or electrical distribution systems by mudslides,

(4) Provisions to avoid contamination of water conduits or deterioration of slope stability by the rupture of such systems,

(5) Similar provisions for sewers which in the event of rupture pose both health and site stability hazards and

(6) Provisions for alternative vehicular access and escape routes when normal routes are blocked or destroyed by mudslides (i.e., mudflow);

(i) The means for assuring consistency between state, areawide, and local comprehensive plans with the plans developed for mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas;

(j) Deterring the nonessential installation of public utilities and public facilities in mudslide (i.e., mudflow)-prone areas.
