(c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a supplier's original production or delivery schedule shall constitute a new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept or reject the amended order according to the provisions of § 333.13.

(d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order: A change in shipping destination; A reduction in the total amount of the order; an increase in the total amount of the order which has negligible impact upon deliveries; a minor variation in size or design (prior to the start of production); or a change which is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.

(e) A person must cancel any rated orders that the person (or a predecessor in interest) has placed with suppliers or cancel the priority ratings on those orders if the person no longer needs the items in those orders to fill a rated order.

(f) A person adding a rating to an unrated order, or changing or cancelling a priority rating must promptly provide written electronic notification to all suppliers to whom the order was sent of the addition, change, or cancellation.
