###### § 333.35 Mandatory acceptance of an allocation order.

(a) Except as otherwise specified in this section, a person must accept and comply with every allocation order received.

(b) A person must not discriminate against an allocation order in any manner such as by charging higher prices for materials, services, or facilities covered by the order or by imposing terms and conditions for contracts and orders involving allocated materials, services, or facilities that differ from the person's terms and conditions for contracts and orders for the materials, services, or facilities prior to receiving the allocation order.

(c) If a person is unable to comply fully with the required action(s) specified in an allocation order, the person must notify FEMA immediately, explain the extent to which compliance is possible, and give the reasons why full compliance is not possible. If notification is given verbally, written, electronic confirmation must be provided within 24 hours. Such notification does not release the person from complying with the order to the fullest extent possible, until the person is notified by FEMA that the order has been changed or cancelled.
