In order to qualify under this subpart, the State must be administering a coastal zone management program which includes the following components, as a minimum:

(a) A state-wide requirement that prohibits new construction and the relocation of structures seaward of an adopted erosion setback. Such setback must be based in whole or in part on some multiple of the local mean annual erosion (recession) rate; and
