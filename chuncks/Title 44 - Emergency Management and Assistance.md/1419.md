(b) Encouraging the development of comprehensive disaster preparedness and assistance plans, programs, capabilities, and organizations by the States and local governments;

(c) Achieving greater coordination and responsiveness of disaster preparedness and relief programs;

(d) Encouraging individuals, States, and local governments to obtain insurance coverage and thereby reduce their dependence on governmental assistance; and
