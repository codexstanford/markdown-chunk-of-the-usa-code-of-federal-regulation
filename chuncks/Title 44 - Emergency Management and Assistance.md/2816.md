####### Inspection authorizations.

(3)An inspection authorization requires a person to permit a duly authorized representative of FEMA to interview the person's employees or agents; to inspect books, records, documents, other writings and information, including electronically-stored information, in the person's possession or control at the place where that person usually keeps them or otherwise; and to inspect a person's property when such interviews and inspections are necessary or appropriate to the enforcement or the administration of the Defense Production Act and related statutes, this part, or official actions.

(d) The production of books, records, documents, other writings and information will not be required at any place other than where they are usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the administrative subpoena or demand for information, a duly authorized official of FEMA is furnished with copies of such material that are certified under oath to be true copies. As an alternative, a person may enter into a stipulation with a duly authorized official of FEMA as to the content of the material.

(e) An administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization must include the name, title, or official position of the person to be served, the evidence sought to be adduced, and its general relevance to the scope and purpose of the audit, investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents are to be interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization will describe them with particularity.

(f) Service of documents must be made in the following manner:

(1) Service of a demand for information or inspection authorization must be made personally, or by certified mail-return receipt requested at the person's last known address. Service of an administrative subpoena must be made personally. Personal service may also be made by leaving a copy of the document with someone at least 18 years of age at the person's last known dwelling or place of business. When a hazard has occurred or is imminent, service of a demand for information or inspection authorization may additionally be made by written electronic communication.

(2) Service upon other than an individual may be made by serving a partner, corporate officer, or a managing or general agent authorized by appointment or by law to accept service of process. If an agent is served, a copy of the document must be mailed to the person named in the document.

(3) Any individual 18 years of age or older may serve an administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization. When personal service is made, the individual making the service shall prepare an affidavit as to the manner in which service was made and the identity of the person served, and return the affidavit, and in the case of subpoenas, the original document, to the issuing officer. In case of failure to make service, the reasons for the failure must be stated on the original document.
