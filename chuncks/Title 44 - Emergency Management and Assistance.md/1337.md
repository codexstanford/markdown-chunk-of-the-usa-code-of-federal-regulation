###### § 204.22 Submitting a request for a fire management assistance declaration.

The Governor of a State, or the Governor's Authorized Representative (GAR), may submit a request for a fire management assistance declaration. The request must be submitted while the fire is burning uncontrolled and threatens such destruction as would constitute a major disaster. The request must be submitted to the Regional Administrator and should address the relevant criteria listed in § 204.21, with supporting documentation that contains factual data and professional estimates on the fire or fire complex. To ensure that FEMA can process a State's request for a fire management assistance declaration as expeditiously as possible, the State should transmit the request by telephone, promptly followed by written documentation.
