The following guidance is provided pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended; section 201 of Executive Order 10480, and § 322.2 of this chapter (DMO-3).

(a) Priority ratings under title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, are not authorized for certain FSC Groups, Classes, and Items:

(1) Which are of the types commonly available in commercial markets for general consumption,

(2) Which do not require major modification when purchased for military or other ratable government use, and

(3) Which are in sufficient supply as to cause no hindrance to the accomplishment of military or other national defense objectives.

(b) Priority ratings may be used for the procurement of other authorized FSC Groups, Classes, and Items only in quantities required to meet the needs of approved programs of ratable agencies. The quantities of current procurement of each Group, Class, and Item shall be based on and shall not exceed the ratio of rated purchases to total purchases for that Group, Class, and Item that was consummated in the 6-month period preceding the first day of January and July in each year. Any other periodic cycle considered suitable and agreed to by the Domestic and International Business Administration, Department of Commerce, and the procuring agency may be substituted.

(c) In the interest of minimizing administrative costs, where rated procurement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, constitutes 97 percent or more of the total procurement of a Group, Class, or Item, all of the Group, Class, or Item may be bought on ratings.
