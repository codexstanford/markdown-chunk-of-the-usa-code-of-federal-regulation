##### Subpart U - Debt-Collection Procedures by Administrative Offset
###### § 102.161 Notification.

(a) The Agency must send a written demand to the debtor in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. In the demand letter, the Agency must provide the name of an Agency employee who can provide a full explanation of the claim. When the Agency deems it appropriate to protect the Government's interests (for example, to prevent the statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. 2415, from expiring), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions.

(b) In accordance with guidelines established by the Agency, the Agency official responsible for collection of the debt must send written notice to the debtor, informing the debtor, as appropriate, of the:

(1) Nature and amount of the Board's claim;

(2) Date by which payment is to be made (which normally may be not more than 30 days from the date that the initial notification was mailed or hand delivered);

(3) Agency's intent to collect by administrative offset and of the debtor's rights in conjunction with such an offset;

(4) Agency's intent to collect, as appropriate, interest, penalties, administrative costs and attorneys fees;

(5) Rights of the debtor to a full explanation of the claim, of the opportunity to inspect and copy Agency records with respect to the claim and to dispute any information in the Agency's records concerning the claim;

(6) Debtor's right to administrative appeal or review within the Agency concerning the Agency's claim and how such review must be obtained;

(7) Debtor's opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the Agency to repay the debt; and

(8) Date on which, or after which, an administrative offset will begin.
