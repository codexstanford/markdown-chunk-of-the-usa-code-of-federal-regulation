###### § 38.63 Authority and procedures for conducting post-approval compliance reviews.

(a) The Director may initiate a post-approval compliance review of any recipient to determine compliance with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIOA and this part.

(b) A post-approval review must be initiated by a Notification Letter, advising the recipient of:

(1) The practices to be reviewed;

(2) The programs to be reviewed;

(3) The information, records, and/or data to be submitted by the recipient within 30 days of the receipt of the Notification Letter, unless this time frame is modified by the Director; and

(4) The opportunity, at any time before receipt of the Final Determination described in §§ 38.95 and 38.96, to make a documentary or other written submission that explains, validates or otherwise addresses the practices under review.

(c) The Director may conduct post-approval reviews using such techniques as desk audits and on-site reviews.
