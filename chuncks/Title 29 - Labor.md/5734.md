######## § 553.3 Coverage - general.

(a)(1) In 1966, Congress amended the FLSA to extend coverage to State and local government employees engaged in the operation of hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and mass transit systems.

(2) In 1972, the Education Amendments further extended coverage to employees of public preschools.

(3) In 1974, the FLSA Amendments extended coverage to virtually all of the remaining State and local government employees who were not covered as a result of the 1966 and 1972 legislation.

(b) Certain definitions already in the Act were modified by the 1974 Amendments. The definition of the term "employer" was changed to include public agencies and that of "employee" was amended to include individuals employed by public agencies. The definition of "enterprise" contained in section 3(r) of the Act was modified to provide that activities of a public agency are performed for a "business purpose." The term "enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce" defined in section 3(s) of the Act was expanded to include public agencies.
