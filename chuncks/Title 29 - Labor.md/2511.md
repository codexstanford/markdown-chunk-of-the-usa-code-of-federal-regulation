(b) The Methods of Administration must be:

(1) In writing, addressing each requirement of § 37.54(d) with narrative and documentation;

(2) Reviewed and updated as required in § 37.55; and

(3) Signed by the Governor.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) At a minimum, each Methods of Administration must:

(1) Describe how the State programs and recipients have satisfied the requirements of the following regulations:

(ii) A system for periodically monitoring the compliance of recipients with WIA section 188 and this part, including a determination as to whether each recipient is conducting its WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity in a nondiscriminatory way. At a minimum, each periodic monitoring review required by this paragraph must include:

(A) A statistical or other quantifiable analysis of records and data kept by the recipient under § 37.37, including analyses by race/ethnicity, sex, age, and disability status;

(B) An investigation of any significant differences identified in paragraph (A) of this section in participation in the programs, activities, or employment provided by the recipient, to determine whether these differences appear to be caused by discrimination. This investigation must be conducted through review of the recipient's records and any other appropriate means; and

(C) An assessment to determine whether the recipient has fulfilled its administrative obligations under section 188 or this part (for example, recordkeeping, notice and communication) and any duties assigned to it under the MOA;

(iii) A review of recipient policy issuances to ensure they are nondiscriminatory;

(iv) A system for reviewing recipients' job training plans, contracts, assurances, and other similar agreements to ensure that they are both nondiscriminatory and contain the required language regarding nondiscrimination and equal opportunity;

(B) Copies of monitoring instruments and instructions;

(C) Evidence of the extent to which nondiscrimination and equal opportunity policies have been developed and communicated as required by this part;
