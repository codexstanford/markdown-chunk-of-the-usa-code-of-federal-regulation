##### § 37.62 What are the authority and procedures for conducting pre-approval compliance reviews?

(a) As appropriate and necessary to ensure compliance with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of WIA or this part, the Director may review any application, or class of applications, for Federal financial assistance under Title I of WIA, before and as a condition of their approval. The basis for such review may be the assurance specified in § 37.20, information and reports submitted by the grant applicant under this part or guidance published by the Director, and any relevant records on file with the Department.

(b) Where the Director determines that the grant applicant for Federal financial assistance under WIA Title I, if financially assisted, might not comply with the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements of WIA or this part, the Director must:

(1) Notify, in a timely manner, the Departmental grantmaking agency and the Assistant Attorney General of the findings of the pre-approval compliance review; and

(2) Issue a Letter of Findings. The Letter of Findings must advise the grant applicant, in writing, of:

(i) The preliminary findings of the review;

(ii) The proposed remedial or corrective action under Section 37.94 and the time within which the remedial or corrective action should be completed;

(iii) Whether it will be necessary for the grant applicant to enter into a written Conciliation Agreement as described in §§ 37.95 and 37.97; and

(iv) The opportunity to engage in voluntary compliance negotiations.

(c) If a grant applicant has agreed to certain remedial or corrective actions in order to receive WIA Title I-funded Federal financial assistance, the Department must ensure that the remedial or corrective actions have been taken, or that a Conciliation Agreement has been entered into, before approving the award of further assistance under WIA Title I. If a grant applicant refuses or fails to take remedial or corrective actions or to enter into a Conciliation Agreement, as applicable, the Director must follow the procedures outlined in §§ 37.98 through 37.100.
