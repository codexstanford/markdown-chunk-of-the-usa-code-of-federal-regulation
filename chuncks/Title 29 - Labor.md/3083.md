##### § 94.200 What must I do to comply with this part?

There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

(a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to-

(1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 94.205 through 94.220); and

(2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 94.225).

(b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 94.230).
