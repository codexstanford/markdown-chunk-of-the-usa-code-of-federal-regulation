##### § 13.8 Multiemployer plans or other funds, plans, or programs.

(a) A contractor may fulfill its obligations under Executive Order 13706 and this part jointly with other contractors-that is, as though all of the contractors are a single contractor-through a multiemployer plan that provides paid sick leave in compliance with the rules and requirements of Executive Order 13706 and this part.
