Subpart A of this part 780 and this subpart K together constitute the official interpretative bulletin of the Department of Labor with respect to the meaning and application of section 13(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.

The section 7(c) exemption is not limited to homeworkers.
