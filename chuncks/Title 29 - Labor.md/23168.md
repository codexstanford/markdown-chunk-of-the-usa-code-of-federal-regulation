###### § 1954.20 Complaints about State program administration.

(a) Any interested person or representative of such person or groups of persons may submit a complaint concerning the operation or administration of any aspect of a State plan.

(2) In determining whether an investigation shall be conducted and in determining the timing of such investigation, the Assistant Regional Director shall consider such factors as:

(i) The extent to which the complaint affects any substantial number of persons;

(ii) The number of complaints received on the same or similar issues and whether the complaints relate to safety and health conditions at a particular establishment;

(iii) Whether the complainant has exhausted applicable State remedies; and

(iv) The extent to which the subject matter of the complaint is pertinent to the effectuation of Federal policy.
