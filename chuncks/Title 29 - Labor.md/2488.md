###### § 37.34 What type of notice must a recipient include in publications, broadcasts, and other communications?

(a) Recipients must indicate that the WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity in question is an "equal opportunity employer/program," and that "auxiliary aids and services are available upon request to individuals with disabilities," in recruitment brochures and other materials that are ordinarily distributed or communicated in written and/or oral form, electronically and/or on paper, to staff, clients, or the public at large, to describe programs financially assisted under Title I of WIA or the requirements for participation by recipients and participants. Where such materials indicate that the recipient may be reached by telephone, the materials must state the telephone number of the TDD/TTY or relay service used by the recipient, as required by § 37.9(c).

(b) Recipients that publish or broadcast program information in the news media must ensure that such publications and broadcasts state that the WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity in question is an equal opportunity employer/program (or otherwise indicate that discrimination in the WIA Title I-financially assisted program or activity is prohibited by Federal law), and indicate that auxiliary aids and services are available upon request to individuals with disabilities.

(c) A recipient must not communicate any information that suggests, by text or illustration, that the recipient treats beneficiaries, registrants, applicants, participants, employees or applicants for employment differently on any prohibited ground specified in § 37.5, except as such treatment is otherwise permitted under Federal law or this part.
