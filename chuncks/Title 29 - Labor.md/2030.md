#### § 30.15 Enforcement actions.

Where the Registration Agency, as a result of a compliance review, complaint investigation, or other reason, determines that the sponsor is not operating its apprenticeship program in accordance with this part, the Registration Agency must notify the sponsor in writing of the specific violation(s) identified and may:

(a) Offer the sponsor technical assistance to promote compliance with this part.

(b) Suspend the sponsor's right to register new apprentices if the sponsor fails to implement a compliance action plan to correct the specific violation(s) identified within 30 business days from the date the sponsor is so notified of the violation(s), or, if the sponsor submits a written response to the findings of noncompliance, fails to implement a compliance action plan within 30 days of receiving the Registration Agency's notice upholding its initial noncompliance findings. If the sponsor has not implemented a compliance action plan within 30 business days of notification of suspension, the Registration Agency may institute proceedings to deregister the program in accordance with the deregistration proceedings set forth in part 29 of this chapter, or if the Registration Agency does not institute such proceedings within 45 days of the start of the suspension, the suspension is lifted.

(c) Take any other action authorized by law. These other actions may include, but are not limited to:

(1) Referral to the EEOC;

(2) Referral to an appropriate State fair employment practice agency; or

(3) Referral to the Department's OFCCP.
