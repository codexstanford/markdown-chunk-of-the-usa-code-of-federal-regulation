###### Some Basic Definitions
####### § 783.10 "Establishment".
######## Phillips,Walling,Mitchell,Bekins Van & Storage Co.,

As used in the Act (including the provision quoted below in § 783.11), the term "establishment", which is not specifically defined therein, refers to a "distinct physical place of business" rather than to "an entire business or enterprise" which may include several separate places of business. This is consistent with the meaning of the term as it is normally used in business and in government, is judicially settled, and has been recognized in the Congress in the course of enactment of amendatory legislation (v.334 U.S. 490;v.352 U.S. 1027; 95 Cong. Rec. 12505, 12579, 14877; H. Rept. No. 1453, 81st Cong., 1st sess. p. 35). This is the meaning of the term as used in sections 3(r), 3(s), and 6(b) of the Act. An establishment may have employees employed away from the establishment as well as within it (H. Rept. No. 1453, supra).
