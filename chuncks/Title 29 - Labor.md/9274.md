## Subtitle B - Regulations Relating to Labor
### Chapter XIV - Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
#### PART 1620 - THE EQUAL PAY ACT
##### § 1620.22 Employment cost not a "factor other than sex."

A wage differential based on claimed differences between the average cost of employing workers of one sex as a group and the average cost of employing workers of the opposite sex as a group is discriminatory and does not qualify as a differential based on any "factor other than sex," and will result in a violation of the equal pay provisions, if the equal pay standard otherwise applies.
