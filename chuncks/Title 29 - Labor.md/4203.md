####### § 417.14 Form and time for filing of appeal with the Administrative Review Board.

(a) An interested person may appeal from the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision by filing written exceptions with the Administrative Review Board within 15 days of the issuance of the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision (or such additional time as the Administrative Review Board may allow), together with supporting reasons for such exceptions, in accordance with 29 CFR part 26. Blanket appeals shall not be received. Impertinent or scandalous matter may be stricken by the Administrative Review Board, or an appeal containing such matter or lacking in specification of exceptions may be dismissed.

(b) In the absence of either an appeal to the Administrative Review Board or review of the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision by the Administrative Review Board on his own motion, such initial decision shall become the decision of the Administrative Review Board.
