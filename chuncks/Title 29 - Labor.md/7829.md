### Chapter IX - Construction Industry Collective Bargaining Commission
#### PART 901 - POLICY STATEMENT ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING DISPUTES AND APPLICABLE PROCEDURES
##### § 901.2 Policy of Commission.

Section 3(c) of the Executive order provides that it is an objective of the Commission "to establish more effective machinery for the resolution of disputes over the terms of collective bargaining agreements which at the same time recognizes the interests of each branch of the industry and preserves existing procedures that have been effective." Accordingly, it is the policy of the Commission:

(a) To encourage each branch of the industry without such a procedure to establish its own procedures to facilitate the settlement of disputes over the terms and application of collective bargaining agreements.

(b) To encourage each branch of the industry having such a procedure, but which procedure is limited in application, to expand the application of such procedure.

(c) To encourage parties in each branch of construction with a procedure to utilize that machinery in all possible cases.

(d) To encourage the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to refer disputes wherever possible to such machinery established in various branches of the industry.
