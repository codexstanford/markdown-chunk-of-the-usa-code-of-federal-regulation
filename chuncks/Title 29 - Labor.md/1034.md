###### § 18.54 Stipulations about discovery procedure.

Unless the judge orders otherwise, the parties may stipulate that:

(a) A deposition may be taken before any person, at any time or place, on any notice, and in the manner specified-in which event it may be used in the same way as any other deposition; and

(b) Other procedures governing or limiting discovery be modified- but a stipulation extending the time for any form of discovery must have the judge's approval if it would interfere with the time set for completing discovery, for hearing a motion, or for hearing.
