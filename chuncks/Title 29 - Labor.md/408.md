(b) Any agreement containing consent findings and an order disposing of a proceeding in whole or in part shall provide:

(2) That the entire record on which any order may be based shall consist solely of the complaint and the agreement;

(3) A waiver of any further procedural steps before the Administrative Law Judge and the Administrative Review Board, as appropriate, regarding those matters which are the subject of the agreement; and

(4) A waiver of any right to challenge or contest the validity of the findings and order entered into in accordance with the agreement.

(c) Within 30 days after receipt of an agreement containing consent findings and an order disposing of the disputed matter in whole, the Administrative Law Judge shall accept such agreement by issuing a decision based upon the agreed findings and order. If a such agreement disposes of only a part of the disputed matter, a hearing shall be conducted on the matters remaining in dispute.
