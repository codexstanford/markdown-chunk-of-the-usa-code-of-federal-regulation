(b) Loads shall be safely rigged before being hoisted.

(c) Plates shall be handled on and off hulls by means of shackles whenever possible. Clips or pads of ample size shall be welded to the plate to receive the shackle pins when there are no holes in the plate. When it is not possible to make holes in or to weld pads to the plate, alligator tongs, grab clamps or screw clamps may be used. In such cases special precautions shall be taken to keep employees from under such lifts.

(d) Tag lines shall be provided on loads likely to swing or to need guidance.

(e) When slings are secured to eye-bolts, the slings shall be so arranged, using spreaders if necessary, that the pull is within 20 degrees of the axis of the bolt.

(f) Slings shall be padded by means of wood blocks or other suitable material where they pass over sharpe edges or corners of loads so as to prevent cutting or kinking.

(g) Skips shall be rigged to be handled by not less than 3 legged bridles, and all legs shall always be used. When open end skips are used, means shall be taken to prevent the contents from falling.
