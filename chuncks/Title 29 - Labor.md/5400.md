To obtain the address of the Regional Office which services your geographic area, please contact your local Wage and Hour Office (under "Department of Labor" in the blue pages of your local telephone book).

(b) Application must be made on the official form furnished by the Wage and Hour Division and must be signed by the employer, the appropriate school official and the student-learner. A separate application must be filed by the employer for each student-learner the employer proposes to employ at subminimum wages.
