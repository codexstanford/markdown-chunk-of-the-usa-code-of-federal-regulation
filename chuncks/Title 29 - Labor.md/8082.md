##### § 1410.5 Special procedures: Medical records.

(a) If medical records are requested for inspection which, in the opinion of the Director of Administration, may be harmful to the requestor if personally inspected by him, such records will be furnished only to a licensed physician, designated to receive such records by the requestor. Prior to such disclosure, the requestor must furnish a signed written authorization to the Service to make such disclosure and the physician must furnish a written request to the Director of Administration for the physician's receipt of such records.

(b) Verification of the requestor's signature will be accomplished by a comparison of signatures if such authorization is not executed within the presence of a Service representative.
