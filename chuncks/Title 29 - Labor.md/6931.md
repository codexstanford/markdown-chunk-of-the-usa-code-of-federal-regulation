######## § 780.907 "Fruits or vegetables."
######### Wirtz,Osceola Farms Co.,

The exempt operations of preparing for transportation and transporting must be performed with respect to "fruits or vegetables." The intent of section 13(b)(16) is to exempt such operations on fruits or vegetables which are "just-harvested" and still in their raw and natural state. As explained at the time of adoption of the amendment on the floor of the House, the exemption was intended to eliminate the difference in treatment of farmers and nonfarmers with respect to exemption of such "handling or hauling of fruit or vegetables in their raw or natural state." (See 107 Cong. Rec. (daily ed.) p. 4523.) Transporting and preparing for transportation other farm products which are not fruits or vegetables are not exempt under section 13(b)(16). For example, operations on livestock, eggs, tobacco, or poultry are nonexempt. Sugarcane is not a fruit or vegetable for purposes of this exemption (v.372 F. 2d 584).
