####### § 417.4 Pre-hearing conference.

(a) Upon receipt of an application filed under § 417.3, the Chief, DOE shall cause an investigation to be conducted of the allegations contained therein, and if he finds probable cause to believe that the constitution and bylaws of the labor organization do not provide an adequate procedure for the removal of an elected officer(s) guilty of serious misconduct he shall:

(1) Advise the labor organization of his findings and

(2) Afford such labor organization the opportunity for a conference to be set not earlier than 10 days thereafter except where all interested persons elect to confer at an earlier time. Any such conference shall be conducted for the purpose of hearing the views of interested persons and attempting to achieve a settlement of the issue without formal proceedings.

(b)(1) If:

(i) The labor organization declines the opportunity to confer afforded under paragraph (a) of this section, and fails to undertake compliance with the provisions of section 401(h) of the Act, or if

(ii) After consideration of any views presented by the labor organization the Chief, DOE still finds probable cause to believe that the removal procedures are not adequate and if agreement for the adoption of adequate procedures for removal has not been achieved and the labor organization refuses to enter into a stipulation to comply with the provisions of section 401(h) of the Act, the Chief, DOE shall submit his findings and recommendations to the Director.

(2) Upon consideration of the Chief, DOE's recommendations, the Director may order a hearing to be conducted before an Administrative Law Judge duly assigned by him to receive evidence and arguments (i) on the applicability of section 401(h) of the Act to the labor organization involved, and (ii) on the question of whether its constitution and bylaws provide an adequate procedure for the removal of an elected union officer guilty of serious misconduct.
