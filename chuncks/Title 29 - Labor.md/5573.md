(1) With respect to grain and soybeans-50 miles;

(2) With respect to any other agricultural commodities-20 miles.

(iii) Five air-line miles of any city with a population of 500,000 or greater, according to the latest available United States Census.

(2) The commodities shall be considered to come from "normal rural sources of supply" within the specified distances from the establishment if they are received: (i) From farms within such specified distances, or (ii) from farm assemblers or other establishments through which the commodity customarily moves, which are within such specified distances and located in the open country or in a rural community, or (iii) from farm assemblers or other establishments not located in the open country or in a rural community provided it can be demonstrated that the commodities were produced on farms within such specified distances.

(3) The period for determining whether 95 percent of the commodities are received from normal rural sources of supply shall be the last preceding calendar month in which operations were carried on for two workweeks or more, except that until such time as an establishment has operated for such a calendar month the period shall be the time during which it has been in operation.
