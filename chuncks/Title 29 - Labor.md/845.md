(b) The Job Corps will only reimburse up to $300.00 per item for claims for loss or damage of personal property under the WIA, up to a maximum of $1,500 per occurrence.

(c) If the property in question is not of a type that the student is authorized to bring to the Job Corps Center, no compensation will be made under this subpart.
