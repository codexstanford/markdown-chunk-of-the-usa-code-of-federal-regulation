####### Practices Performed "By a Farmer"
######## § 780.132 Operations must be performed "by" a farmer.
######### Mitchell,Huntsville Nurseries,

"Farmer" includes the employees of a farmer. It does not include an employer merely because he employs a farmer or appoints a farmer as his agent to do the actual work. Thus, the stripping of tobacco, i.e., removing leaves from the stalk, by the employees of an independent warehouse is not a practice performed "by a farmer" even though the warehouse acts as agent for the tobacco farmer or employs the farmer in the stripping operations. One who merely performs services or supplies materials for farmers in return for compensation in money or farm products is not a "farmer." Thus, a person who provides credit and management services to farmers cannot qualify as a "farmer" on that account. Neither can a repairman who repairs and services farm machinery qualify as a "farmer" on that basis. Where crops are grown under contract with a person who provides a market, contributes counsel and advice, make advances and otherwise assists the grower who actually produces the crop, it is the grower and not the person with whom he contracts who is the farmer with respect to that crop (v.267 F. 2d 286).
