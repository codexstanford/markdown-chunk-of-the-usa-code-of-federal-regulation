###### The Statutory Provisions Regarding Seamen
####### § 783.27 Scope of the provisions regarding "seamen".

In accordance with the above provisions of the Act as amended, an employee employed as a seaman is exempt only from its overtime pay provisions under the new section 13(b)(6), unless the vessel on which he is employed is not an American vessel. Section 13(a)(14) as amended continues the prior exemption, from minimum wages as well as overtime pay, for any employees employed as a seaman on a vessel other than an American vessel. Thus, to come within this latter exemption an employee now must be "employed as" a "seaman" on a vessel other than an "American vessel", while to come within the overtime exemption provided by section 13(b)(6) an employee need only be "employed as" a "seaman". The minimum wage requirements of the Act, as provided in section 6(b) and paragraph (2) of that subsection apply if the employee is "employed as" a "seaman" on an "American vessel". The meaning and scope of these key words, "employed as a seaman" and "American vessel" are discussed in subsequent sections of this part. Of course, if an employee is not "employed as" a "seaman" within the meaning of this term as used in the Act, these exemptions and section 6(b)(2) would have no relevancy and his status under the Act would depend, as in the case of any other employee, upon the other facts of his employment, (§§ 783.18 through 783.20).
