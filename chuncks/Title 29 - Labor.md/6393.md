####### Some Basic Definitions
######## § 779.16 State.
######### State

As used in the Act,means "any State of the United States or the District of Columbia or any Territory or possession of the United States" (Act, section 3(c)). The application of this definition in determining questions of coverage under the Act's definition of "commerce" and "produced" (see §§ 779.12, 779.13) is discussed in the interpretative bulletin on general coverage, part 776 of this chapter. This definition is also important in determining whether goods "for resale" purchased or received by an enterprise move or have moved across State lines within the meaning of former section 3(s)(1) of the Act (prior to the 1966 amendments) and whether sales of goods or services are "made within the State" within the meaning of the retail or service establishment exemption in section 13(a)(2), as discussed in subpart D of this part.
