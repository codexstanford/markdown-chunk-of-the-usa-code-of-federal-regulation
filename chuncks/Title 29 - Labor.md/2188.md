(vi) Otherwise limit a qualified individual with handicaps in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving the aid, benefit, or service.

(2) The Department may not deny a qualified individual with handicaps the opportunity to participate in programs or activities despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or activities.
