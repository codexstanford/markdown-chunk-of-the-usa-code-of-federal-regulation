###### § 95.24 Program income.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and added to funds committed to the project by DOL and recipient, and used to further eligible project or program objectives.

(b) Recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.

(c) Costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.

(d) Proceeds from the sale of property are not program income and shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See §§ 95.30 through 95.37).

(e) Unless DOL's regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.
