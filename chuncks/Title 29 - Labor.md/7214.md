##### PART 789 - GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 12(a) AND SECTION 15(a)(1) OF THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938, RELATING TO WRITTEN ASSURANCES
###### § 789.2 " * * * in reliance on written assurance from the producer * * *."

In order for a purchaser to be protected under these provisions of the Act, he must acquire the goods "in reliance on written assurance * * *." The written assurance specified in section 15(a)(1) is one from the "producer" and in section 12(a) it is one from the "producer, manufacturer or dealer."

(a) The purchaser stamps his purchase order with the statement that the order is valid only for goods produced in compliance with the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act. No written statement concerning the production of the goods is made to the purchaser by the producer. The producer ships the goods which the purchaser has ordered.

(b) The purchaser stamps the above statement on his purchase order and in addition notifies the producer that shipment of the goods so ordered will be construed by the purchaser as a guarantee by the producer that the goods were produced in compliance with the Act. The producer ships the goods to the purchaser.
