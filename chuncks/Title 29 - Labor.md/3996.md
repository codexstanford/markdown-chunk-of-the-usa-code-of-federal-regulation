###### § 102.152 Further proceedings.

(a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the documents in the record. The Administrative Law Judge, however, upon request of either the applicant or the General Counsel, or on the General Counsel's own initiative, may order further proceedings, including an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submission, or an evidentiary hearing. An evidentiary hearing will be held only when necessary for resolution of material issues of fact.

(b) A request that the Administrative Law Judge order further proceedings under this section must specifically identify the disputed issues and the evidence sought to be adduced, and must explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

(c) An order of the Administrative Law Judge scheduling further proceedings will specify the issues to be considered.

(d) Any evidentiary hearing held pursuant to this section will be open to the public and will be conducted in accordance with §§ 102.30 through 102.43, except §§ 102.33, 102.34, and 102.38.

(e) Rulings of the Administrative Law Judge are reviewable by the Board only in accordance with the provisions of § 102.26.
