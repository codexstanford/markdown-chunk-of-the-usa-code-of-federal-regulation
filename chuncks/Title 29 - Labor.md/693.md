(b) Deduction for payments made to third parties pursuant to court order;

(c) Deduction directed by a voluntary assignment of the employee or his or her authorized representative;

(d) Deduction for the reasonable cost or fair value, as determined by the Administrator, of furnishing such employee with "board, lodging, or other facilities," as defined in 29 U.S.C. 203(m) and 29 CFR part 531;

(e) Deduction, to the extent permitted by law, for the purpose of recouping pay and benefits provided for paid sick leave as to which the contractor retroactively denied the employee's request pursuant to § 13.5(e)(3)(iii) or because the contractor approved the use of the paid sick leave based on a fraudulent request.
